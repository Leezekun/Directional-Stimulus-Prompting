An Australian radio DJ has caused uproar after implying readers should boycott Nigella Lawson's cook books until she 'makes a stand against domestic violence' Dee Dee Dunleavy made the comments on her 3AW blog after pictures appeared in a Sunday tabloid that claimed to show Nigella being throttled by her husband, Charles Saatchi, during an argument at a London restaurant. Nigella has since been photographed leaving their West London home with suitcases before police revealed that they were likely to question Saatchi . about the incident. In yet another controversy to engulf Australian radio in recent weeks, Dunleavy - the self-proclaimed Queen of Melbourne Radio - was forced to deny she was 'victim blaming' after receiving a 'torrent of abuse' from angry Nigella fans. 'It's hard to look a the photos of Nigella Lawson, her eyes wide with panic, her husband Charles Saatchi's hand wrapped around her throat, without feeling revulsion and disbelief,' she initially wrote. 'The 'Domestic Goddess' is not flirty and fun as fans of her cooking shows know her, but fearful.' She went on to ask why Nigella then posted a 'picture of a buttered, toasted bagel on her official Twitter page, as though nothing else was on her mind but food' while the pictures of the apparent row were going viral online. 'That's not the response we were after, Nigella,' she added. 'We think you are strong, beautiful and successful [... and] we don't like to think of you cowering from a thug. A man so boldly abusive he had no qualms about attacking you in public. 'Nigella, like it or not, you're a beacon for women from all walks of life.

Shocking pictures: Sitting in their favourite Mayfair restaurant, Charles Saatchi repeatedly grabs his wife Nigella Lawson by the neck . Mr Saatchi is almost certain to be questioned by detectives within weeks . Her comments triggered a groundswell of fury among Nigella fans across the world. One wrote on the 3AW website: 'VICTIMS need support NOT more thuggery at the hands of Radio jerks ( jocks). How dare you presume the higher moral ground. When will Australian radio clean up its act and image - it's a national disgrace that rubbish like this is allowed.' Another . added: 'I never comment on random internet articles unless I feel . really strongly, but this article has really offended me - who are you . to tell a victim of domestic violence how she should and shouldn't . behave as a victim?' They . went on: 'She didn't ask for this to happen, she owes nobody anything. It is her husband's fault for hurting her - where is the blame being . placed on him and telling him that we'll stop providing him with revenue . until he ceases to be a violent partner? Awful.' Dunleavy later sought to dilute her words in a followup statement. 'First . and foremost, my wish for Nigella Lawson is that she is safe and well, . and as far away from her beastly husband as possible,' the 3AW presenter . wrote. 'The fact that I have copped a . torrent of abuse today for urging her to take a stand against domestic . violence pales into insignificance compared to what she must be going . through.' Denial: In yet another controversy to thrust Australian radio under the global spotlight in recent weeks, the self-proclaimed Queen of Melbourne Radio was forced to issue a statement denying she was 'victim blaming' after receiving a 'torrent of abuse' from angry Nigella fans .

"By . Bianca London . An artist has married the man of her dreams four years after painting his lookalike in a prophetic piece of artwork. In 2009, Chloe Mayo, who was single at the time, quickly dashed off an oil painting of her holding hands with a handsome, dark bearded man. Not thinking anything more of the creation, the 31-year-old left the painting to gather dust in the corner of her living room. Artist Chloe Mayo painted a picture of her perfect husband... only to later meet an identical real-life version . Because the oil painting was so uncannily similar to Michael, she hid the canvas under her bed in fear he thought she may have been stalking him, but he fell in love with it . In her search for love, Chloe joined an online dating website, and began messaging Michael Goeman, 30. Two months later the pair met - and Chloe was shocked to find Michael was the spitting image of the man in her painting. In fear of putting off her new lover, Chloe hid the uncanny painting under her bed, only revealing it once she had been on more dates with Michael. Thankfully, he was not put off by the painting and they continued their relationship for a further 18 months until he proposed while they were holidaying in the south of France. Three years after they first met, Chloe and Michael married, and the painting now has pride of place in the living room of the couple's home in Worcester Park near Croydon in Surrey. Chloe, a regulation manager for medical equipment, said: 'I had moved back to the UK after spending time working in Australia and the house needed brightening up. After dating for six weeks Chloe thought Michael's face looked familiar and then remembered her painting and realised he was the spitting image of the man she painted . 'I started painting some pictures to decorate the walls and I had a couple of ideas I wanted to incorporate. 'I wanted to create an image of a couple at nighttime but I didn't really have any set ideas, I just did what felt natural. 'I painted kisses coming off the trees so it looked romantic but the facial features on the people I actually added in last, I didn't intend for it to look like me with anyone. 'I didn't hang it up, I just left it in a pile in the corner of my lounge for weeks and forgot about it but after a night out with Michael I realised he looked just like the man. 'He was due to come over to my house and I thought that if he saw the picture he would think I was a stalker and a bit weird, so I hid it under my bed. 'About a week later I mustered up the courage to show him and although he looked a bit confused, he saw the funny side when I explained what had happened. The happy couple, who met online, now hang the painting on their wall and dub him 'the man in the painting' 'Now we have hung the picture up on the wall in the lounge and all our friends called Michael ""The man in the painting"". 'I never would have thought I'd have predicted my husband and I don't normally believe in that sort of thing, but I suppose it must be fate.'", Artist Chloe Mayo dashed off an oil painting holding hands with a man. But soon realised it was Michael Goeman as her spitting image. Couple continued relationship for 18 months before marrying in 2010.

"By . Helen Pow . PUBLISHED: . 16:12 EST, 13 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:03 EST, 14 October 2012 . President Barack Obama has admitted that giving the green light to the raid that killed Osama bin Laden was 'a flip of the coin' decision. The president revealed he was only 50 per cent confident that the man spotted by the C.I.A. living in an Abbottabad compound was the world's most wanted terrorist, according to a new book that weaves together accounts from Obama and top decision-makers on the events leading up to the daring operation and it's aftermath. 'This is 50–50,' Obama said, silencing the small group of senior officials gathered in the situation room. 'This is a flip of the coin. You guys, I can't base this decision on the notion that we have any greater certainty than that.' Crucial meetings: President Barack Obama, pictured left, discussed the raid with his team of security advisers on May 1 2011 . Published in part in the latest Vanity Fair, Mark Bowden's eye-opening book reveals how the head of the C.I.A.'s bin Laden team was only 60 per cent sure the terrorist was living in the Pakistan property. Michael Morell said the evidence to suggest that Saddam Hussein was hoarding weapons of mass destruction, which later turned out not to be the case, was 'much stronger' than the intelligence on bin Laden's whereabouts. Morell had been personally involved in the flawed analysis of Saddam's weapons capability. 'I'm telling you, the case for W.M.D. wasn't just stronger — it was much stronger,' he said. But Obama decided to press ahead. Nail-biting events: The president sat with vice president Joe Biden, and secretary of state Hillary Clinton to watch the mission against Osama bin Laden in the Situation Room . 'One of the things you learn as president is you're always dealing with probabilities,' he told Mr Bowden. 'No issue comes to my desk that is . perfectly solvable. No issue comes to my desk where there's 100 per cent . confidence that this is the right thing to do. 'Because if people were . absolutely certain then it would have been decided by someone else. 'In this situation, what you started getting was probabilities that disguised uncertainty as opposed to actually providing you with more useful information.' The only major dissenter to the plan was Joe Biden, the book says. 'Mr President, my suggestion is: don't go,' the vice president said, believing that a failed attack would scupper any chance of a second term.

At that point my estimation was that we weren't going to be able to do it better a month or two months or three months from now. 'We weren't going to have better certainty about whether bin Laden was there, and so it was just a matter of pulling the trigger.' The book explains that a courier initially led the C.I.A. to the compound where they discovered three families living together in the large property, which was out of place for the area. In hiding: This undated image from video seized from the walled compound of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan . The identity of the third family, however, was a mystery. The most important clue was the figure who came to be known as The Pacer, a man in traditional Pakistani attire and prayer cap who regularly took walks around the vegetable garden. Agents took photos and video footage of the man as he paced the grounds. They also counted the pieces of laundry that were hung out to dry to determine the size of the hidden family. The number of wives and children corresponded with the number of family members they believed might be living with bin Laden. The C.I.A. then got mission commander admiral Bill McRaven on board, and the elite group of Navy Seals did two separate practice runs on American soil before the nail-biting May 2011 raid, which ended the life of the al Qaeda leader.", The president reveals that he was only 50 per cent confident that the man spotted by the C.I.A. living in an Abbottabad compound was the world's most wanted terrorist.

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- The bitter standoff between government troops and Red Shirt protesters in downtown Bangkok worsened Friday, the day after the wounding of a key protest leader aggravated the already deep tensions permeating the Thai capital. Hospital officials reported 16 people died in confrontations Friday in Bangkok, an urban fortress under siege and beset by gunfire, tear gas and stone-throwing. That followed the death of one person Thursday. The unrest boiled over after Thai authorities set a new deadline to seal off the Bangkok intersection where protesters have gathered by the thousands for the past month. In addition to the deaths, more than 140 people were wounded in the violence, including four non-Thais -- a Pole, a Canadian, a Liberian and a Myanmarese. A government official said Thai forces were slowly getting control of the downtown area, with video footage showing soldiers shooting rounds toward the area with protesters. Among those wounded on Friday was a journalist from a French television station who was shot in the leg. What are protests about? The government said it was forced to take action after demonstrators disregarded an ultimatum by Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva to vacate the intersection by Wednesday. Panitan Wattanayagorn, the acting government spokesman, said on Friday security forces who have been the objects of attacks have no choice but to respond. He told reporters that forces have been dutifully following the rules of engagement, which allows them to use live ammunition to protect themselves and their comrades. He assured Bangkok residents and foreigners there that the forces have no intention of harming anyone. The government, he said, is ""very confident"" it will be able to ""stabilize the situation"" and get it ""under control very soon."" Also, he said the prime minister is looking forward to working with others in hammering out reforms. The United Front for Democracy, the formal name of the Red Shirt opposition, has been demanding that Abhisit dissolve the lower house of Parliament and call new elections. The Red Shirts support former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a bloodless military coup. Tensions ramped up when Maj. Gen. Khattiya Sawasdipol -- a renegade general better known as Seh Daeng, which means Red Commander -- was shot and wounded by a sniper's bullet on Thursday, an action that left him in critical condition. Seh Daeng was shot in the head while being interviewed by journalists in makeshift barricades set up by protesters. Thomas Fuller of The New York Times told CNN that the opposition leader was looking at him and answering questions when ""the bullet hit him in the forehead, from what I could tell."" Reporter: Bullet 'felt like it grazed my head' ""It looks like the bullet came over my head and struck him. I don't have any way of confirming this beyond what I remember from the scene, but it felt like it grazed my head,"" he said. Fuller, who said bamboo pikes and rubber tire barricades have been formed as a makeshift encampment by the protesters, said the opposition figure was facing out of the barricades and into Bangkok's business district of tall office buildings. ""He was standing in the same location for a while when I was talking to him but he was moving around, he was gesticulating,"" Fuller said. ""He wasn't standing still, he was bobbing his head."" iReport: Are you there? Send your images, video . Seh Daeng did not appear to be armed or have bodyguards, but was dressed in camouflage jacket and a floppy hat, Fuller said. Seh Daeng is a controversial public figure, even within the protest movement, Fuller said. Some Thai opposition leaders see him as an impediment to a peaceful resolution to the political stalemate that has gripped Thai politics, the reporter said. ""He's a renegade in sort of all senses,"" Fuller said. ""He's a renegade from the army, a hardliner within the protest movement. He told me today he thought they (other opposition leaders) were being cowardly and he wanted to carry on.""", Hospital officials report 16 people died in confrontations Friday. The unrest comes after Thai officials set a new deadline to seal off the intersection. The prime minister has been accused of slew of harsh bullets and a grenade-threatened tirade.,generated_text
