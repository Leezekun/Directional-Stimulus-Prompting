"After the already disappointing ""Final Conflict"", the series hits rock-bottom with this very weak fourth entry. At least the third film tried (unsuccessfully) to continue the story of Damien, while this one simply rehashes and copies ideas from the ""Omen"" (animals are","  replaced with ghosts) series after the events of ""Ego One"". But this may not hold up as a complete piece, as the fourth issue was not so successful, as the fourth film does not hold up as a complete film.<br ...",generated_text
"The great talents of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressberger are noticeable in their wonderful ""A Matter of Life and Death"". It was part of the recent tribute to Mr. Powell that played at the Walter Reade in New York. This film, in particular, shows us one of the best British films from that, or any other era.<br /><br />""A Matter of Life and Death"" has a brilliant cinematography by Jack Cardiff, a man who knew how to work wonders with a camera. Particularly impressive is the contrast from the monochromatic tones given to the scenes played in heaven, and the colored ones when the action comes back to earth. This was quite a coup, and well ahead of its times. The black and white sequence that involves the long staircase where Peter and the Conductor are chatting has to be one of the most amazing things on any film.<br /><br />Much has been said in this forum about the film, so our comment will be about the great acting Powell and Pressberger got out of the large, distinguished cast, who responded magnificently to the directors' guidance.<br /><br />David Niven, is Peter,","  a gifted actor, who gets a chance to play with many different actors in this film. David is an actor from China, who has traveled to the United States from China from time to time, where he had a chance to meet many different ...",generated_text
"I would have enjoyed this movie slightly more had not been for Jason (Herb) Evers constant harping on experiment. Many early reviewers of The Seven Samurai accused Toshiro Mifune of overacting. Yet, as more and more critics viewed that film they saw it as being purposefully done. Jason Evers is obviously not Toshiro Mifune, and his overacting is exactly that.<br /><br />Most of the actors in this B classic were rather","  different from each other. Most of the actors are in different walks of life, and not just friends, which is interesting considering many of the characters in this film would be friends. All in all, a great film to watch in any movie ...",generated_text
"Like his early masterpiece ""The Elephant Man"" Lynch proves to his detractors that he can tell a straight, simple story without losing his artistic touch. This is a true story of an elderly retired man (expertly played by Richard Farnsworth) who decides to ride a tractor across a few states to pay a final visit to his estranged brother who now stands","  in awe of him. The film is filled with humor and suspense, without a dull moment. The film is well paced and well written. As a film, you will enjoy watching the people in the film.<br /><br />The ...",generated_text
"This movie is some of the worst crap I have ever seen. I literally got a sharp pain in my head while watching this movie. The CGI was awful, and the story was just a waste of ink. Dean Cain's character was Mr-Super-Intuitive-I-can-figure-out-anything, except he can't seem to work his own helicopter correctly. The biggest problem","  I had with ""Dancing Star"" was that so many scenes got stuck in between, and that was really annoying.<br /><br />I just hope it was ever released on big-name TV, because everyone who commented on this ...",generated_text
"Caught part of GEORGE 2 on TV recently, but couldn't get myself to watch it through to the end. Just awful! I can't even remember the plot. All I know is that George and Ursula were not the George and Ursula of the first movie, which was bad enough. There's a lot of scrambling around, but the direction and editing were so shoddy and choppy, it was like watching outtakes"," , and as a result, the movie sucked. When they tried to edit the first scene into a story and it didn't make any sense, it totally blew me away. You get that, you get that.<br /><br /> ...",generated_text
"Remember the early days of Pay Per View? I do, and i can almost remember the number you had to CALL to actually rent the movie on your t.v. As a kid we always wanted to rent playboy, but this meant actually calling someone from PPV and asking to rent it. And then you get the nerve to do it and your watching four hours of soft core no angle crap. Well the reason i bring that up is because this movie too was on ppv. And i remember almost every scene",  so why was i talking to everyone but i didnt. When they had a playboy playgirl on their night out call you could practically hear her sob every time she caught a glimpse of her father. Because he never wanted her around. It ...,generated_text
"If you weren't there, then unfortunately this movie will be beyond compassion for you. Which as I say is a shame because although some of the acting is amateurish, it is meant to be for realism. Let's face it--in real life, we don't say things in an exacting or perfect way, even when we mean to. In this sense, it works. This, however, does not apply to our ""known"" actors in this film, notably Jodie Foster (born a natural). The fact that the other 3 girls are not accomplished only adds to the story--Jodie plays the glue that struggles to keep their friendship close, even with the obvious feeling of fatality. Meaning that no matter how close friends are, eventually there are some people that just fade away, no matter how you try.<br /><br />And therein is the core of the movie. It's not about partying, it's not about sexuality, but about these 4 girls and their final time as still young girls before they have to go the world alone.<br /><br />If you have ever had a friendship like that in your life, you will feel this movie--it will mean a lot to you, no matter what era it is set in, or what era you grew up in. We all knew these girls in school, or at the very least knew of them.","  I don't want to go through theirstories, but suffice it to say that one of the only people who is still alive is Jean Grey, whose character is a young girl from the 50's who grew up and became a very important woman ...",generated_text
