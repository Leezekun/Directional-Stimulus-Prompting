On nightshifts at his police station, Superintendent Paul Clements is used to dealing with the usual collection of drunks and other ne\u2019er do wells. But he was surprised when three Romanian children arrived at the central London police station at 3am and said they were 130 miles from home. The children, aged 12, 14 and 17, told officers they lived with their parents in Nottingham and then asked for a taxi home and a meal from McDonalds. Instead, officers bought the youngsters sandwiches from a nearby petrol station and called social services to care for them. They also called the children\u2019s parents who immediately travelled from the family home in Nottingham to pick them up. It remains unclear how the children managed to travel to London or how they were able to leave their home without their parents noticing.

And unlike the vehicles in Mad Max, it's built to keep drivers comfortable, with leather seats and a DVD player fitted in the cab . Farmers Weekly told MailOnline that GPS steering systems are farmers\u2019 favourite piece of modern farming technology. Steering systems got one third of the total votes out of the top 10 favourite farming tools. They are used to steer tractors in more precise patterns than humans are capable of, resulting in significant savings and improved productivity. GPS provides accurate location information by calculating the distance from at least three satellites and can also be used on farms to analyse soil fertility, Alex Thomasson, professor of biological and agricultural engineering at Texas A&M University wrote in an article for The Conversation. Farmers can use a GPS receiver to collect soil samples from pre-selected parts of fields. They then send the samples off to a lab for analysis, which creates a fertility map of their farm. Farmers can use the map to work out the amount of fertiliser needed for each location, giving their crops the best chance of growing and saving them money. Variable-rate technology (VRT) fertiliser applicators dispense just the right amount of fertiliser in each location, varying the qualities as the farmers go along. Before GPS, it was down to the driver to keep the tractor straight to avoid using too much seed, fertiliser or fuel, but today many farmers have some form of GPS steering, which means overlapping has all but disappeared and straight lines are easy. This has resulted in significant savings and improved productivity, which is why the innovation is a firm favourite with tech-savvy farmers. GPS self-steering systems were voted as being British farmners' favourite piece of modern farming technology in a poll by Farmers Weekly. But not all tractors using the technology are as impressive and inwardly luxurious as this latest model. Despite its rugged appearance, the tractor offers a comfortable ride for drivers. The cab is fitted with climate control and the seat is leather and heated. There is even a DVD player to watch while the tractor follows its pre-set path up and down fields. Only 28 of the machines - which cost up to a quarter of a million pounds each ($373,000) - will be made, and Britain is set to be one of the biggest markets.

However, the tractor features luxuries such as leather seats, for example . For farmers, aerial photographs taken by drones offer a quick and easy way to check on the progress of crops and determine where they may need to replant or direct pesticide applications. Researchers at the University of Illinois are using drones on farms to take aerial photos of crops growing in research plots. Dennis Bowman, a crop science teacher at the university, deliberately made mistakes on one test plot by not applying enough nitrogen fertilizer and is now using drones to see if they can reveal potentially weaker crops. \u2018As the crop gets up and going, we'll fly over it and see if we can detect those areas sooner than we could visually from the ground,\u2019 he said. \u2018We're also looking at doing some scans over our herbicide studies to see if the drone photography can help us identify where crops are stressed by postemergence herbicide applications.\u2019 Mr Bowman spent two summers as a commercial crop scout and said that walking through tasseling corn in high temperatures is unpleasant. \u2018The odds of actually getting to the far end of that field on foot to see what's going on are pretty slim. To get a bird's-eye view of your crop, the drones offer a handy way to do it.\u2019 He is using two quadricopters affixed with a Go-Pro camera and a Canon Powershot SX260 camera with a lens for infrared photography to see if they can spot potential crop trouble. \u2018Standard pictures and video taken with drones can tell us a lot. But what we're looking to give us even more information is multispectral cameras that can give us imagery in other wavelengths, such as near-infrared, to help us identify areas of crop stress. \u2018It probably isn't going to tell us what the problem is, but it will tell us where problems are so that we can target our scouting in those specific areas and determine what might be occurring.\u2019 Infrared images will help the researchers identify plants in the farm that appear to be absorbing or reflecting light differently - an indication that the plants are under some type of stress, such as pests, disease or nutrient deficiencies. The drones may be used to spot an invasive weed called Palmer amaranth, which is spreading across the Midwest and is becoming increasingly resistant to herbicides to the extent that it could drastically reduce farmers' yield potential in affected fields. \u2018Before the soybean rows close, or if we get a different spectrum response from some of these weeds as they break through the canopy, we may see some of those weeds show up in the imagery as well to identify where there are hot spots and problems,\u2019 Mr Bowman said.", "reference": "Tractor has a rugged look and is the\u00a0latest in agricultural machinery .\nChallenger MT775 can cultivate 150 acres of land in a single day .\nIt has a GPS steering system so it can drive in perfectly straight lines .\nCab of the tractor has luxuries such as leather seats and a DVD player ."}, "2": {"id": "d6654ce38dd70601d95aa8a9da5c77f29c62990c", "article": "Though most brides dream of their one-off wedding dress being hand sewn by designer couturiers, that could soon be a thing of the past. One company in China is now making 3D printed bridal dresses. Unveiled at the\u00a0TCT + Personalize Asia exhibition Shanghai this weekend, the dresses have been created using advanced technologies and nylon powder, rather than silks, lace and chiffon. The future of fashion? Two 3D printed wedding dresses were unveiled this weekend at Shanghai's\u00a0TCT + Personalize Asia technology expo, created by Chinese designers specialising in digital technology . But despite their less-than-luxury beginnings, the designers claim the dresses are soft to touch, comfortable to wear and durable too. Created by Chinese 3D printing specialists\u00a0Xuberance, who also make ties, hair pins, jewellery and home accessories using the technology, the dresses could signal fashion of the future. Rather than the revered traditional dressmaking skills of Parisian couturiers, normally fantasised about by brides-to-be, these dresses are made using a process called\u00a0selective laser sintering (SLS). The dress 'fabric' is constructed by using lasers to fuse together the nylon powder, slowly building up the material in layers. Each dress takes around one week to make, using advanced digital technologies and laser techniques, to fuse together nylon powders. The specialist process however, comes with a high price tag . The cost of the 3D printed wedding dresses is yet to be revealed, but a bridal veil made using the same specialist process is expected to retail at\u00a020,000 Chinese yuan (approximately \u00a32167.35) And it's not just dresses and accessories that Xuberance applies their innovative digital technology to. Though details have been kept under wraps, a 3D printed wedding cake and sugar flowers were also on display at the exhibition. But if you were hoping to cut costs by skipping the bridal shops, it seems unlikely. A 3D printed veil  created using the same process currently costs 20,000 Chinese yuan (approximately \u00a32167.35), while a metallic effect headpiece retails at 5,000 yuan (around \u00a3541.84) in the company's online shop. The dresses are, as with the most sought-after haute couture bridal designers, being given the 'price on request' treatment, but since they each take a week to 'print out', costs are likely to be high. Despite shunning traditional fabrics like chiffon or lace, the tech-savvy dresses are intricately detailed and designed to resemble the real thing, but offer new scope for more ambitious patterns . Would you wear Xuberance? Though bridal dreams are traditionally filled with thoughts of Chanel, Vera Wang and Oscar de la Renta, new technology could soon change the face of wedding fashion .", "reference": "Forget gowns hand made by couturiers - these come from 3D printers .\nSpecialist company in China hopes to change the face of bridal style .\nDresses take one week to make using lasers to fuse together nylon powder ."}, "3": {"id": "2377814ea3b4decebd0459502cd19af1ab682939", "article": "Andrew Marr has branded Jeremy Paxman as a \u2018genuinely tortured, angry individual\u2019. The BBC presenter said Mr Paxman, 64, was barely able to hide his disdain for those he interviews \u2013 and that it had been a mistake to allow him to grill David Cameron and Ed Miliband last Thursday. Speaking at the London School of Economics, Mr Marr argued the former Newsnight host\u2019s aggressive interviews were \u2018not a good replacement\u2019 for debate between the Prime Minister and the Labour leader. Scroll down for video . Andrew Marr (left) has launched an extraordinary personal attack on Jeremy Paxman (right) - branding the former Newsnight host as a \u2018genuinely tortured, angry individual\u2019 The interviews, on Channel 4 and Sky, were conducted separately and followed weeks of negotiations between broadcasters and political parties over the format. \u2018The thing about Jeremy is that he is a genuinely tortured, angry individual \u2013 and you get the real Jeremy,\u2019 Mr Marr said. \u2018He looks disdainful and contemptuous and furious with his guests because he by and large is. You can\u2019t fake these things on television.\u2019 However, Mr Marr, 55, suggested Mr Paxman had forgotten why the leader interviews were being televised and had allowed his own ego to get in the way. \u2018No disrespect to Jeremy Paxman, but it would have been a lot more interesting had it been head to head,\u2019 he said. \u2018Replacing that with a good \u201cPaxmaning\u201d for both of them, while entertaining, was not a good replacement. \u2018There is a danger for all of us, as it were, in the interviewer\u2019s chair to forget that we are not the ones standing for election. \u2018And I thought Ed Miliband did score [in the interview] when he said, \u201cJeremy, you\u2019re important, but you\u2019re not that important\u201d.\u2019 Mr Marr, a former colleague of Mr Paxman, said it had been a mistake to allow the former Newsnight presenter to \u00a0grill Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband last Thursday for the election debate . A number of television critics said Mr Paxman dominated the show so strongly that viewers might have finished wanting to vote for him rather than either of the party leaders. However, Mr Marr\u2019s comments went down badly with viewers, who accused the BBC political editor of being \u2018supine\u2019, \u2018sycophantic\u2019 and having an \u2018inflated sense of his own importance\u2019. Others speculated Mr Marr\u2019s remarks were driven by jealousy. The two men spent nearly 15 years as colleagues at the BBC, until Mr Paxman quit last year. But they have had relatively little to do with each other. Mr Paxman hosted a series of documentaries and fronted BBC2\u2019s flagship current affairs programme, Newsnight. Mr Marr, who started out as a newspaper journalist, has spent the past decade at the helm of BBC1\u2019s Sunday current affairs programme, The Andrew Marr Show. He also fronts BBC Radio 4\u2019s Start The Week each Monday. Speaking at the London School of Economics, Mr Marr said Paxman\u2019s aggressive interviews were \u2018not a good replacement\u2019 for a debate between the two political leaders . A BBC source said executives were \u2018very surprised\u2019 by Mr Marr\u2019s outburst, as the two men never really \u2018trod on each other\u2019s toes\u2019 even when they worked together. But Mr Marr made it clear he prefers a friendlier approach than the aggressive line of attack for which Mr Paxman is renowned. \u2018I have never believed that the right approach to a political interview is to say to the interviewee, in effect, \u201cYou\u2019re a scoundrel, you\u2019re a liar, and I\u2019m going to treat you like that\u201d,\u2019 he said on Friday. \u2018The best I can do is to ask intelligent questions, keep eye contact \u2013 intelligent, sensible questions that the alert viewer would want to be asked. \u2018And if they\u2019re not answered, ask them again. And if they\u2019re not answered then, just make it clear to everybody that X or Y has not answered the question and move on.

That aggression was clear last Thursday when he took Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband to task, in two separate interviews. The Prime Minister was asked to defend soaring immigration, whether he could live on a zero-hours contract, and made to squirm over his close ties with former Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson. Mr Miliband\u2019s grilling was so severe the presenter asked him at the end: \u2018Are you OK, Ed?

She loves dressing up as Elsa from \"Frozen,\" playing with Barbie dolls and going to the park or shopping. But what makes the British-Nigerian youngster stand out is the fact that she's also a university undergraduate. Esther, from Walsall, an industrial town in the UK's West Midlands region, is one of the country's youngest college freshmen. The talented 10-year-old enrolled at the Open University, a UK-based distance learning college, in January and is already top of the class, having recently scored 100% in a recent exam. \"It's so interesting. It has the type of maths I love. It's real maths -- theories, complex numbers, all that type of stuff,\" she giggles. \"It was super easy. My mum taught me in a nice way.\" She adds: \"I want to (finish the course) in two years. Then I'm going to do my PhD in financial maths when I'm 13. I want to have my own bank by the time I'm 15 because I like numbers and I like people and banking is a great way to help people.\" And in case people think her parents have pushed her into starting university early, Esther emphatically disagrees. \"I actually wanted to start when I was seven. But my mum was like, \"you're too young, calm down.\" After three years of begging, mother Efe finally agreed to explore the idea. A marvelous mathematical mind . Esther has always jumped ahead of her peers. She sat her first Math GSCE exam, a British high school qualification, at Ounsdale High School in Wolverhampton at just six, where she received a C-grade. A year later, she outdid herself and got the A-grade she wanted. Then last year she scored a B-grade when she sat the Math A-level exam. Esther's mother noticed her daughter's flair for figures shortly after she began homeschooling her at the age of three. Initially, Esther's parents had enrolled her in a private school but after a few short weeks, the pair began noticing changes in the usually-vibrant youngster. Efe says: \"One day we were coming back home and she burst out in tears and she said 'I don't ever want to go back to that school -- they don't even let me talk!' \"In the UK, you don't have to start school until you are five. Education is not compulsory until that age so I thought OK, we'll be doing little things at home until then. Maybe by the time she's five she will change her mind.\" Efe started by teaching basic number skills but Esther was miles ahead. By four, her natural aptitude for maths had seen the eager student move on to algebra and quadratic equations. And Esther isn't the only maths prodigy in the family. Her younger brother Isaiah, 6, will soon be sitting his first A-level exam in June. A philanthropic family . Not content with breaking barriers to attend college at just 10 years old, Esther is also writing a series of math workbooks for children called \"Yummy Yummy Algebra.\" \"It starts at a beginner level -- that's volume one. But then there will be volume two, and volume three, and then volume four. But I've only written the first one. \"As long as you can add or subtract, you'll be able to do it. I want to show other children they are special,\" she says. Meanwhile, Esther's parents are also trying to trail blaze their own educational journey back in Nigeria. The couple have set up a foundation and are in the process of building a nursery and primary school in Nigeria's Delta region (where the family are from). Named \"Shakespeare's Academy,\" they hope to open the school's doors in September. The proposed curriculum will have all the usual subjects such as English, languages, math and science, as well as more unconventional additions including morality and ethics, public speaking, entrepreneurship and etiquette. The couple say they want to emulate the teaching methods that worked for their children rather than focus on one way of learning. \"Some children learn very well with kinesthetics where they learn with their hands -- when they draw they remember things. Some children have extremely creative imaginations. Instead of trying to make children learn one way, you teach them based on their learning style,\" explains Efe. The educational facility will have a capacity of 2,000 to 2,500 students with up to 30% of students being local children offered scholarships to attend. Efe says: \"On one hand, billions of dollars worth of crude oil is pumped out from that region on a monthly basis and yet the poverty rate of the indigenous community is astronomical.\" While Paul adds: \"(The region has) poor quality of nursery and primary education. So by the time the children get secondary education they haven't got a clue. They haven't developed their core skills. \"The school is designed to give children an aim so they can study for something, not just for the sake of acquiring certifications.

Albert Einstein was the first person to describe this apparent dual state of light in 1905 in an attempt to explain some of the apparently contradictory behaviour it displays. Yet when scientists attempt to observe these states, it has only ever been able to see light behave as photon particle or as an electromagnetic wave. Scroll down for video . The above image is what scientists say is the first ever snapshot of light behaving as a particle and a wave.\u00a0The bottom 'slice' of the image shows the particles, while the top image shows light as a wave . But now researchers based at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), have captured the first ever snapshot of light behaving as both a wave and particle. The work shows that Einstein was right when he proposed that electromagnetic radiation could behave as both a wave and a particle at the same time. Scientists have developed a camera system that lets users see round corners using laser light. The system takes advantage of the way light is reflected and refracted to reconstruct the shape of objects outside the field of view. Researchers at the University of Bonn and the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, used a laser to scatter light on a surface. is shone on a surface . In a demonstration, a laser was shone on a white wall, while a camera watches the scene. All it can see initially through the lens is a \u2018spot\u2019 of light. A computer records the image and the data is processed so the outlines of an object behind the screen gradually appear. The technique for capturing the image could be used to help open up new areas of superfast computers that exploit the quantum states of materials. He said: 'This experiment demonstrates that, for the first time ever, we can film quantum mechanics - and its paradoxical nature - directly. 'Being able to image and control quantum phenomena at the nanometer scale like this opens up a new route towards quantum computing.' The wave-like behaviour of light can be seen clearly when sunlight is refracted through a prism and splits into the different colours according to the wavelengths of the light. However, it can also be seen behaving like a particle - like photons hurled out as radiation by materials like uranium or when gas high in the atmosphere is battered by the solar wind to produce the aurora over the poles. In a paper published in the journal Nature Communications, the research team conducted an experiment and then used electrons to image the light. By firing a pulse of laser light  at a tiny metal wire suspended on graphene, this added energy to the particle wire and caused them to vibrate. The Aurora Borealis (shown above) is caused by photons particles thrown out by gas atoms high in the Earth's atmosphere as they collide with high energy charged particles carried by the solar wind from the sun . White light splitting into different colours through a prism (above) shows how it behaves like a wave . Light then traveled along the wire in two possible directions. When the waves travelling in opposite directions meet each other they form a new 'standing wave' of light. By then firing a stream of electrons close to the nanowire, they were able to image this wave in an ultrafast microscope due to the way the electrons sped up or slowed down. Dr Carbone said that the resulting image produces a fingerprint of the wave-nature of light while also simultaneously demonstrating that it is a particle too. The electrons pass close to the standing wave of light, they hit the photons it contains, again affecting the resulting image.", "reference": "Swiss researchers have used lasers and nanowires to capture the images .\nScientists have been attempting to image light in both states for decades .\nAlbert Einstein was first to describe light as being both a wave and particle .\nThe experiment could lead to new types of super fast 'quantum computers'"}, "7": {"id": "049b45f88e6ab31bfc8e22ccf903aed4f87ba5d8", "article": "Fernando Alonso will return to Formula One at the Malaysian Grand Prix on Sunday after passing a medical examination by three Cambridge University doctors.

For multi-eventers, packing your suitcase to go abroad can be a bit of an ordeal. I noticed it more last year when I just did long jump at the World Indoors and I only had to take one pair of trainers.\u00a0With pentathlon I\u2019ve got five different pairs of spikes for the hurdles, high jump, shot putt, long jump and 800m. All kinds of things come with being a multi-eventer and making sure you have room in your case is just one of them. It was easy for this weekend because I\u2019m not away for long so will pretty much live in my GB kit and a couple of pairs of jeans. Britain's Katarina Johnson-Thompson spoke about her preparations for the European Indoor Championships . The 22-year-old athlete will be competing in the pentathlon in this year's indoor championships in Prague . Normally at Championships I room with Holly Bleasdale or Jodie Williams but neither of them are competing in the indoors this season so I don\u2019t know who I\u2019ll be in a room with this time \u2013 you get the chance to pick but I just left the box empty. Sprinters normally have their events in the afternoon so they can stay up later and sleep in whereas I\u2019m always on first thing so it\u2019s more about trying to find someone that matches your timetable than your personality. I\u2019m just competing for the one day on Friday so I\u2019ll have the rest of the weekend just to relax and be a spectator so it will definitely be good to do that. As well as being supported by the National Lottery I am supported by the philanthropist Barrie Wells, who also sponsors Jenny Meadows so I\u2019ll be with him in the crowd cheering her on and holding a banner for the 800m final on Sunday. If I\u2019m rooting for any athlete other than myself it\u2019s going to be Jenny because she\u2019s had such a tough past. She\u2019s been so unlucky not just with injuries but competing with lots of drugs cheats in her event. I\u2019m glad athletics is being cleaned up because to have an equal playing field means so much to us as athletes. You dedicate your life to it and it\u2019s so upsetting to think someone might be getting an unfair advantage and there\u2019s literally nothing you can do about it. It\u2019s definitely good that all the drugs cheats are getting exposed and it\u2019s going to be a clean sport. I\u2019ve got personal bests in the long jump and high jump already this season. The last time I did pentathlon was 2012 because I didn\u2019t do an indoor season in 2013 and last year I was ill. I was a little kiddy in 2012 so I definitely should be getting one this time. The Liverpudlian is confident after recording personal bests in the long jump and high jump this season . I feel like a different person since I had a foot injury, which ruled me out of the Commonwealth Games and European Championships last year. I can\u2019t really pinpoint what has changed I just enjoy being out there and I\u2019m not nervous to compete any more. Sometimes before the injury I used to think: \u201cI just want to be a normal teenager or young person\u201d but I realised it was this that I love and enjoy. It made me realise what I will be missing out on. I\u2019ve been focussing so much on the indoors that I haven\u2019t had chance to do a lot of javelin training which is one of my weakest events. I\u2019m really looking forward to my next session with the British number one Goldie Sayers, who is helping me work on my technique, in April. Away from competition, there\u2019s been a new addition to my household - I\u2019ve got another sausage dog as a companion to Chorizo. I\u2019ve called him Bronx. I wanted to call him Richmond to stick with the sausage themed names but my boyfriend said it was too posh and I was trying to push the sausage names too much! He\u2019s well trained though, much better than Chorizo. I think it\u2019s like having children - you make more mistakes with the first one and then correct them with the second!

Indian cleric Zakir Naik, who has also said 9/11 was an inside job, was handed the King Faisal International Prize for Services to Islam at a glittering ceremony in Riyadh. A physician by training, the Mumbai-based 49-year-old has carved out a career as a charismatic television preacher, but his controversial views have led to him being banned from entering the UK. And the winner is... Saudi King Salman bin Abdul Aziz presents Zakir Naik, president of the Islamic Research Foundation in India, with the 2015 King Faisal International Prize for Service to Islam . Dr Naik was one of five winners presented a gold medal, a certificate hand written in Arabic calligraphy and an endowment of more than \u00a3130,000 by Saudi King Salman during a ceremony at a luxury hotel yesterday. The president of the Islamic Research Foundation in India, Dr Naik was honoured for being one of the most renowned non-Arabic speaking promoters of Islam. He founded the Peace TV channel, billed as the world's only channel specialising in comparative religion, which now reaches an estimated English-language audience exceeding 100million, according to his award citation. 'Islam is the only religion that can bring peace to the whole of humanity,' he said in a video biography aired at the ceremony. It was on a broadcast on Peace TV that Dr Naik suggested that Muslims men may rape their slaves. 'There are many verses in the Koran which say you can have sex with your wife and with whatever your right hand possesses,' he told a mass audience at one event. 'Right hand possesses,' he went on. 'Which means your slaves.' He goes on to qualify his statement by saying the world at the time of the Prophet Mohammed was beset by war, making slavery more common, and that a pious Muslim would marry the slave he wanted to have sex with first. But the remark seems to be a disturbing echo of the doctrines of the Middle East's Islamic State insurgency. Last October, the terror group published an article on its propaganda page stating that the sexual enslavement of captured Yazidis was justified because they are a 'pagan minority'. 'Enslaving the families of the kuffar (non-believers) and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of the Sharia,' the article pronounced.

In a July 2008 Peace TV broadcast he suggested that Al-Qaeda was not responsible for flying hijacked airliners into New York's World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, killing almost 3,000 people. 'Even a fool will know that this was an inside job,' he said in the video, claiming then-President George W. Bush was behind the attacks. In 2010 Dr Naik was barred from entering Britain after the Home Secretary cited 'numerous comments' which showed his 'unacceptable behaviour'. During his acceptance speech at Riyadh's Al Faisaliah Hotel last night, Dr Naik told dignitaries he would be donating his prize money to Peace TV.

The beta version of its live translation tool lets people speak to others in another language - even if they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re saying. The tool then translates speech instantly, providing both text and spoken translations.

Heading into Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address on Tuesday to a joint session of Congress, both sides should immediately agree to a cease fire. The speech itself is a terrible mistake.  Arranging it without prior consultation with the White House was not only an affront to Barack Obama but to the Presidency itself. One would have thought that after all the uproar, Netanyahu would have caught a \"cold\" and postponed, but now that he plans to go ahead, he should at least give a measured, thoughtful address -- not the barn burner for which he is known.  But let's be clear: he also deserves a respectful hearing in Congress from both sides of the aisle. Blame for the deterioration in relations is shared here in America as well as in Israel. This conflict began on a personal level. Those close to Obama and Netanyahu say the two men took an instant dislike years ago and have since descended into loathing one another. Obama, they say, regards Netanyahu as headstrong, bombastic and reckless. Netanyahu sees Obama as weak, unreliable and priggish. The Obama team also accuses Netanyahu of timing his Congressional speech to rally Israeli voters behind him in elections two weeks away -- Bibi as Churchill standing up to the Nazis -- while Netanyahu's team is convinced Obama is desperate for a deal to burnish his legacy -- the Nobel laureate who brought peace. Each thinks the other endangers the future of the world and each has allowed his top lieutenants to viciously attack the other in the press. But in recent months what began as personal antipathy has deepened and widened into a serious split over the best way to head off Iran's aggressive push to become a nuclear power.  The Iranian threat has long been vexing; former Defense Secretary Bob Gates once told me it was the toughest problem he saw in nearly a half century serving of distinguished service in national security.  There are no obvious solutions acceptable to key parties. The Obama administration believes that a compromise agreement with Iran limiting -- but not dismantling -- its nuclear capability is better than to have current talks fall apart, risking an armed showdown.  The Netanyahu government believes the agreement which Obama appears ready to accept will let Iran eventually wriggle free and build a bomb. In truth, there is merit to both points of view -- and the devil here is not only in the details but in the very structure of an agreement.  As Obama believes, a negotiated settlement is far preferable to a possible war or learning to live with a nuclear Iran. But what is alarming not only to Israel but to other American friends in the region -- and rightly so -- is that the U.S. and its partners in the negotiation with Iran (Russia, China, the UK, France, Germany) have made repeated concessions to get an Iranian signature without getting major concessions in return. Consider: The U.S. and Israel started down the negotiating path saying publicly that Iran must totally dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of punishing economic sanctions against Teheran.  Leaks since then have shown that in pursuit of a deal, the U.S. is now willing to accept more and more centrifuges in Iran -- 6,500 by latest count. Washington and Tel Aviv once talked of an agreement that would last at least 20 years. \u200b According to the latest leaks, the agreement may only cover 10 years and then give the Iranians a chance to bust loose.  This is only the beginning of a long litany of differences. In defense of U.S. compromises, Secretary of State John Kerry makes a persuasive point that a temporary agreement reached 18 months ago containing compromises has worked far better than critics have conceded and therefore, those now at the table deserve a benefit of doubt. But administration critics are also right in arguing that the Obama administration seems to be betting that if just given a few years grace, an odious regime which sponsors terrorism across the Middle East will suddenly change spots and become a partner for peace. In times past, American and Israeli leaders have sometimes had bad blood and still made substantive progress.  President Jimmy Carter could barely stand Israeli leader Menachem Begin but they and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat shaped the Camp David accords in 1978. Despite sometimes bitter words during Israel's recent dust-up with Hamas -- especially directed by Israel against Secretary Kerry -- Obama ensured that Israel was well supplied militarily, particularly with the Iron Dome missile defense system that saved countless Israeli lives. But today's rift seems far more perilous.  It is not only personal but substantive and comes at a moment of spreading turmoil across the Middle East.  Israel should remember that America is its best friend in a world where anti-Semitism is once again raising its hideous head.  The United States should appreciate that for Israel, a nuclear Iran could pose instant annihilation. America also has Arab friends in the Middle East who have vital interests here -- friends like Saudi Arabia who, if an agreement is weak, will feel compelled to pursue their own bomb, unleashing a lethal arms race. This is a moment that demands that leaders in both Israel and the United States lower their voices, take their differences indoors and begin restoring broken bonds of trust.  In private talks, they should work hard finding ways to bridge differences between them, starting with creative proposals coming recently from veteran U.S. diplomats. Dennis Ross, for example, argues that if the U.S. could greatly strengthen an inspections regime -- a much bigger team who could go anywhere, any time in Iran -- and could enshrine in legislation that Iranian violations will bring military action, that would go a long way toward allaying opposition fears.  Martin Indyk proposes that, drawing upon ideas embraced by President Clinton in Middle East negotiations 15 years ago, the U.S. could enter a formal treaty with Israel, voted upon by Congress, that would provide a U.S. \"nuclear guarantee\" to Israel in event of an Iranian breakout. In short, the moment is dire but not hopeless.  What is clearly needed is a cease fire.  Secretary Kerry seemed to be pointing in that direction Sunday when he said Netanyahu is welcome to speak in the U.S. on Tuesday.  Others should now take up the cause, recognizing that our real adversaries are not in Tel Aviv or Washington but among those in Teheran who support terror and mayhem across the Middle East.", "reference": "David Gergen: Netanyahu's speech is a terrible mistake of his making but he deserves a hearing .\nThe rift in US-Israel relations over Iran is serious, needs repair, Gergen says ."}, "18": {"id": "ed52c80b3fe197a6fce2b51e95b428287f149896", "article": "Ronaldinho seems to have been given the perfect gift by NBA star LeBron James, a dazzling watch thought to be worth around \u00a340,000.

The Prime Minister said he wanted to 'expand' the marriage tax allowance, which begins next month and is worth \u00a3212-a-year for some couples. He said some of his natural supporters had 'drifted' to other parties, as he vowed to stick to his promise to cut net migration to the 'tens of thousands', despite the number soaring to almost 300,000. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron has vowed to expand the marriage tax allowance to win back disgruntled Tory supportersa . Under the Tory policy, 4million married couples are in line for the new tax break designed to support for stay-at-home parents. The \u00a31,060 transferable tax allowance will particularly benefit couples where one parent does not work or only works part-time. However, if both people in a couple earn more than \u00a310,600 they will not qualify and higher rate taxpayers earning more than \u00a342,385 a year are also excluded. The idea was first promised by Mr Cameron when he ran for the Tory leadership in 2005, and marks the first recognition of marriage in the tax system since the married couples' allowance was phased out in 1999. It will apply to spouses who do not use all of their personal allowance \u2013 either because they are at home looking after children, or work part-time and earn less than the threshold for income tax, \u00a310,600 in April. They will now be able to transfer up to \u00a31,060 of their unused personal tax-free allowance to a spouse or civil partner, as long as the recipient of the transfer pays the basic rate of income tax, levied on income up to \u00a342,385. That will save the couple up to \u00a3212 a year on their tax bill. At the Tory spring forum yesterday, Mr Cameron was heckled by party member Mike Howson who said the PM had 'betrayed this country on Europe and immigration' The Conservative Party will spend an extra GBP8 billion on the NHS if it wins the general election to fund a five year plan drawn up by its chief executive, Jeremy Hunt has promised. The Health Secretary said the Government would fully fund the plan drawn up by NHS England boss Simon Stevens, which would see \u00a32billion being pumped into the health service every year until 2019-20. The so-called 'Stevens plan' will see a total of \u00a330 billion put into the NHS, with \u00a322 billion found through efficiency savings and \u00a38 billion in extra spending. Until now only the Liberal Democrats had pledged to find the money but Mr Hunt has signed the Tories up to the plan. Asked by the Sunday Times if the Tories would find the full \u00a330billion, Mr Hunt said: 'Yes. We've demonstrated that we're as good as our word. 'At the last election we were the only party that promised to protect the NHS budget. We didn't just protect it, we increased it. 'We said to Simon Stevens, 'How much do you need for your plan next year, the first year of your five-year plan?' He said '\u00a31.7billion', and we actually found him \u00a32billion. 'We're now doing the work as to what the efficiency savings are. The gap might be more than \u00a38bn, it might be less. 'That will all be settled in the summer when we do the spending-round discussions. We will continue to spend more in real terms year in, year out.' However, the idea was mocked by Lib Dem Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg who said the state should not lecture people on their private lives. 'We should not take a particular version of the family institution, such as the 1950s model of suit-wearing, bread-winning dad and aproned, home-making mother - and try and preserve it in aspic,' Mr Clegg said in 2011. 'That's why open society liberals and big society conservatives will take a different view on a tax break for marriage.' However, Mr Cameron has signalled that if he is returned to power he wants to increase the amount that married couples could save on their tax bills. He told the Sunday Telegraph: 'I am very proud to have kept my commitment to introduce the married couples' tax allowance. I think it will prove very popular. 'I think it's absolutely right that we recognise marriage in the tax system properly and I would like to see that expanded.' Mr Cameron suggested that it was part of attempts to win back traditional Tory voters who have switched to other parties, including Labour and Ukip. 'I accept I have a task in the next 41 days to win back people who are instinctively Conservative, who have strong Conservative values and some of them have drifted off to other parties. I need to win them back.' At the Tory spring forum yesterday, Mr Cameron was heckled by party member Mike Howson who said the PM had 'betrayed this country on Europe and immigration'. Mr Cameron has come under fire after promising 'no ifs, no buts' to cut net migration to below 100,000. But latest figures released last week show that a total of 298,000 more people arrived in Britain than left in the year to September, as the numbers arriving from the rest of the EU hit a record high. A record 624,000 arrived in Britain in a year, up from 530,000 in the previous 12 months. At the same time, 327,000 left, a figure which has barely changed since 2010. Net long-term migration to the UK was estimated to be 298,000 in the year ending September 2014, a major rise on the 210,000 figure a year earlier . Some senior Tories urged Mr Cameron to ditch the pledge, but he has vowed to repeat it for the general election this year too. He said: 'Britain is facing quite a lot of pressure because the level of migration has been too high for too long. You see that on school places, and you see that in some places on the health service. 'I can absolutely say to people who are concerned about this, 'I hear you, I hear your concern, I get your message.

Researchers claim that sharing a few chuckles makes people more willing to tell others something personal about themselves, without necessarily being aware that they are doing so. The act of verbally opening up to someone is a crucial building block that helps to form new relationships and intensify social bonds. Laughing with a stranger (illustrated with a stock image) makes us more likely to open up and tell others something\u00a0personal about ourselves, which encourages bonds of friendship, a new study claims . Such self-disclosure can be of a highly sensitive nature - like sharing one's religious convictions or personal fears - or a superficial scrap of information such as a favourite type of food. Alan Gray of University College London (UCL) set out to investigate the role and influence of laughter in this disclosure process. Together with his colleagues, he observed the behaviour of 112 students from Oxford University, who did not known each other and were divided into groups of four. They watched a 10-minute video together, without chatting to one another. The videos were designed to invoke different amounts of laughter as well as the amount of positive feelings or emotions they elicited. Participants watched different videos including a clip of comedian Michael MacIntyre (pictured) to encourage them to laugh . One, for example, featured a stand-up comedy routine by Michael McIntyre, while another was a golf instruction video and a third, an excerpt from a nature documentary. After the volunteers watched the chosen video, the levels of laughter and their emotional state was measured. Each group member also had to write a message to another participant to help them get to know each other better. The researchers found that participants who had a good laugh together shared significantly more intimate information than the groups who did not watch the comedy routine. Mr Gray suggests this is not merely because it is a positive experience, but because of the physiology behind laughter, which triggers the release of the so-called \u2018happy hormone\u2019 endorphin. The findings, published in Springer's journal Human Nature, support the idea that laughter encourages people to make more intimate disclosures to strangers. Scientists believe that the person who disclosed information, was seldom aware of what they had done, and it was only the listener who realised it had happened. \u2018This seems to be in line with the notion that laughter is linked specifically to fostering behaviors that encourage relationship development, since observer ratings of disclosure may be more important for relationship development than how much one feels one is disclosing,\u2019 Mr Gray said. \u2018These results suggest that laughter should be a serious topic for those interested in the development of social relationships.\u2019 A recent study has revealed that playfulness comes high on the list of desirable attributes in a long-term partner. Experts say that a sense of fun is more important to many people than whether someone has a degree or is religious. Research by the University of Zurich revealed that playfulness is important to both sexes \u2013 just behind friendliness, intelligence and a sense of humour. Play to win hearts: A new study has revealed that playfulness comes high on the list of desirable attributes in a partner (illustrated with a stock image) - just behind\u00a0friendliness, intelligence and a sense of humour . They also found that naturally playful people deem humour, a laid back attitude and creativity more important in partners than their more serious peers. They described playful adults as those having a love of wordplay who enjoy teasing, people who are spontaneous and will take on a challenge lightheartedly and those who play the fool, for example. Reserachers asked asked 327 young adults from Germany, Switzerland and Austria to examine a list of 16 characteristics and indicate whether or not they found them desirable in a potential long-term partner. The results showed that men and women largely agreed in their orders of preference, although there were differences in individual ratings. For example, women found a sense of humour more important than men and men found an exciting personality more important than women. Friendliness, intelligence, humour and a fun tendency came at the top of the list. Playfulness ranked mid-table, although not all that far behind the favourites. \u2018Therefore, this personality trait also seems important for the choice of partner \u2013 at least more so that the partner having a degree, good genes or being religious,\u2019 said Dr Ren\u00e9 Proyer.", "reference": "Act of verbally opening up to someone helps form\u00a0friendships .\nUniversity College London explored the effect using video clips .\nFound the comedy clip promoted more sharing than a less funny video ."}, "24": {"id": "f488e72fb3bcc664e9bee1196402062217a759a0", "article": "A couple have been left devastated after they spent 'every penny' on a dream home which they found covered in animal urine and faeces on the day they moved in.

The carpet was so wet with animal urine it had to soaked through to the joists, Ms Campbell claimed . When they entered the property Ms Campbell said she was hit with a smell so strong it could 'knock you out' She claims she was hit with a foul pong that could 'knock you out' when she picked up the keys and unlocked the front door. Faeces were splattered up the walls and urine covered the floors to the point that the carpets and floorboards needed to be removed. Horrified Ms Campbell and her fiance, David Alonzi, 46, believe the property in Crossgates, Dunfermline, Fife, was used as a dog run in the months following their viewing and accepted offer. Ms Campbell said: 'When we got the brochure and viewed (the house), it looked fantastic, beautifully presented. It ticked all the boxes of what David and I were looking for.' After there were delays finalising some of the contract details - known in Scotland as the missives - she received the keys on January 22, just over 10 weeks after viewing the property. 'When we got the keys we could not believe what was in front of us. We opened the front door and it was cat p*** I could smell. 'I have never seen anything like it in my life. There were yellow marks at the door entrance. I went to have a smell and it nearly knocked me out. 'There are poo and pee stains on the terracotta carpet. It was absolutely saturated wet with pee. We still have all the evidence locked in the garage. 'The carpet was wet. It was soaking. It went through to the underlay which was like a baby's nappy. Ms Campbell and her fiance David Alonzi believe the property in Dunfermline, Fife, was used as a dog run in the weeks before they moved in . Floorboards and carpet had to be pulled up as the couple tried their best to rid themselves of the smell . 'We lifted the carpet up and the actual floorboard itself was wet. We then realised how extreme this was as urine had soaked all the way through to the joists. 'We couldn't understand how bad the hallway smelled until we cut two feet of plaster from the floor up in the hall.' She believes the former owner of the house, a prison officer, was leaving her animals unattended in the property during 12-hours shifts. She spoke to neighbours who said the two dogs - believed to be boxers - and three cats did not get out very often. The former owner allegedly told her that the property was 'a wee bit dodgy' but that she would make it 'immaculate' for them to move in. Richard Peters, a house surveyor working for Allied Surveyors Scotland, said he checked the property on October 21 last year. Ms Campbell points out where animal waste was left smeared against a wall . Marie Campbell and David Alonzi pictured outside the home they purchased - which they are say they cannot even live in . This picture, taken of the home as it was advertised in the estate agents' brochure, show it in perfect living condition prior to the sale . The living room looked modern, clean and tidy, prior to its alleged use as a dog run . The kitchen was also orderly prior to the damage caused by what was suspected to be animal waste . Pictured is the back section of the property, where building materials and animal-waste covered debris now lies . He said: 'It wasn't like that when I saw it. I would say at the time that there was no evidence of squelching underfoot or evidence of these horrible substances in accessible areas when I saw the house.' The couple have spent their life savings and say they cannot afford to live or fix the property properly - which they estimate would cost at least \u00a310,000. The couple have now been forced to rent a flat for \u00a3500 each month, as they cannot move into the 'health hazard'. Scottish property law differs to that in the rest of the UK. Once a formal written offer has been accepted in writing, both parties are bound to the transaction by contract. Failure by one party to adhere to this written agreement, known as the 'missives' procedure, can mean they must pay the other party a hefty compensation fee. A sale contract is commonly known as 'concluded missives' - with the missives being the correspondence which completes the transaction. Across the rest of the UK, either party can withdraw from the transaction up until the point when a contract is officially signed. Ms Campbell said: 'I feel helpless because I can't do a thing. 'I just can't see myself ever settling in there after everything we've gone through with all the deception and lies we've been told. 'We are really struggling to do anything about this. We are currently renting a flat costing us \u00a3500 a month. 'We cannot move into this house in that condition, it's an absolute health hazard. 'Even after scrubbing the house for two weeks with enzyme cleaner and bleach, we couldn't get rid of the terrible smell.' Adrian King, of selling agent Remax, Dunfermline branch, added: 'The house was marketed by office and viewed and inspected by the purchaser who then preceded to purchase the property. 'Any deterioration in the property which may have occurred in the intervening period between the inspection and purchase, is a matter to be resolved between the respective purchasers, vendors and solicitors.' Kate McQuillan, understood to be the former owner, was not available for comment. Her solicitors sent a letter to the solicitors of Marie Louise Campbell and David Alonzi, which states: . \u2018With regards to the carpets and floorboard, [Ms Quillian] is very upset at the allegation the dogs had been urinating through the whole house. \u2018She offered to touch bits up in the kitchen where the dogs slept and your client told her not to bother. \u2018Our client will not be meeting the cost of replacement floorboards.

Grim task: Rescue workers inspect the remains of the Germanwings Airbus A320 and its victims at the site of the crash, near Seyne-les-Alpes . Passengers screamed as Mr Sondenheimer attempted to smash his way in with a crowbar after Lubitz locked him out and put the plane into a descent. But the only sound from the cockpit was Lubitz breathing as the aircraft plummeted at 3,500 feet per minute before smashing into the French Alps, killing all 150 of those on board. The transcript from the plane\u2019s black box recorder revealed Lubitz\u2019s responses to the landing checks and him calmly encouraging Mr Sondenheimer to go the toilet. After Mr Sondenheimer left him at the controls, he switched the autopilot from the cruising altitude of 38,000ft to 96ft \u2013 a move that was certain to crash the plane over the Alps. German investigators have found torn-up sicknotes in Lubitz\u2019s Dusseldorf flat which showed he had hidden the extent of his illness from his employers. At least one of the medical certificates covered the day of the crash last Tuesday. The 27-year-old was also said to be \u2018living on the edge\u2019 because he feared that his deteriorating blurred vision would cost him his pilot\u2019s licence. And his relationship with blonde maths teacher, named by German media as Kathrin Goldbach, was said to be in trouble, with local reports suggesting she may have been pregnant. Maths teacher Kathrin Goldbach \u2013 who had planned to marry Lubitz next year \u2013 reportedly told pupils that she was \u2018going to be a mum.\u2019 Search:\u00a0The speed of the crash meant that most of it was obliterated and no bodies have been discovered intact .

She was also said to have travelled to the scene of the crash, only to arrive and discover that he was the perpetrator of the disaster. Miss Goldbach, 26, told the pupils at the Gesamtschule in Krefeld, near Dusseldorf, she was pregnant, German newspaper Bild reported. The pair met as teenagers while working together at a Burger King in his home town of Montabaur. They moved together to Dusseldorf and shared a flat after he qualified as a pilot around four years ago. They intended to marry but his constant demands and desire to be \u2018in control\u2019 meant that by the time of the crash she was looking to end their relationship. Reports emerged that police searching his flat had found a \u2018small mountain of pills\u2019 and he had apparently been refusing to take his antidepressant medication. An excerpt from his school yearbook said he would \u2018become a professional pilot so as to sell his cocktails around the world\u2019. Yesterday a British air safety expert said Lubitz was able to hide his medical problems because of a \u2018gaping hole\u2019 in the system for monitoring pilot health. Under confidentiality laws rules, which also operate in the UK, patients do not have to tell GPs where they work and doctors are not able to tell employers about any health issues because of patient confidentiality.

It would happen in the UK as well.\u2019 On the in-flight recording, described in German newspaper Bild, Mr Sondenheimer is initially heard apologising for a short, 26-minute delay in the departure from Barcelona, and promising to make up the time on the routine flight to Dusseldorf. During snippets from the conversation, he also explains to his colleague that he had not had time to go to the toilet before they left Spain. Lubitz tells him he can go to the toilet \u2018at any time\u2019 in a tone described as \u2018laconic\u2019 by French authorities. After completing their mid-flight checks for landing, Lubitz says to Mr Sondenheimer again: \u2018You can go now.\u2019 Two minutes later Mr Sondenheimer agrees to go, and says: \u2018You can take over.\u2019 There is the sound of a seat being pushed back and a click of the closing door. Shortly afterwards there is a loud bang, like someone trying to enter the cockpit. This is followed by a \u2018loud, metallic banging against the cockpit door\u2019 \u2013 believed to be Sondheimer using a crowbar to try to break in.

Hunan TV Station's animal reality show 'Wonderful Friends' - where stars perform tasks with animals in a south China zoo - became an instant hit when 20 million people tuned into the first episode. But the weekly show, which saw a chimpanzee start throwing things and in clear distress when separated from his son, has caused uproar amongst animal rights groups. Unnatural: A young orangutan is dressed in human clothes for the hit realilty show in China . An elephant is given a pedicure by Chinese actor Huang Xuan and a chimpanzee is forced to wear a Superman costume, in some of the show's more unusual scenes, dubbed 'cruel' by experts talking to\u00a0People's Daily\u00a0Online. Wildlife experts argue the programme is exploiting the animals, with many reacting in ways that show they are stressed. Cruel: Chinese actor Huang Xuan gives an elephant a pedicure in a bizarre task in a Chinese reality show . One expert, Miss Jiao, said\u00a0that people are mistaking the creature's distressed reactions as cute. For example, a chimpanzee that appears to be 'grinning' is actually showing signs of\u00a0of 'anxiety, fear and threat'. Pictures which show a young orangutan being dressed in human clothes could lead to alienation with other orangutans likely to ignore it, she warned. One part of the show saw a celebrity taking a young chimpanzee to 'Find its Father' which led to the father suddenly becoming emotional and violent. The creatures are known to chase, stomp and bite unknown chimpanzees or even commit infanticide, leading to worries about the impact the tasks are having on the wild animals.

Heartless: A young chimp is dressed in clothes while an elephant received a pedicure as part of the 'reality' tv show making waves in China . Producers have also been accused of courting disaster by placing potentially dangerous animals including lions, elephants and zebras alongside inexperienced celebrity zookeepers. Chang Jiwen, deputy head of the Development Research Centre of Resources and Environmental Policy Institute,\u00a0said animals should not be used for the sake of entertainment and called for tougher legislation.\u00a0'We cannot use our emotions to design and manipulate the animals, animals are not there to be harassed for the entertainment of people,' he said.\u00a0'We should not start from the emotional needs of ourselves or for effect or for ratings of the show to interfere with the lives of animals. 'When they see these strangers, they might become afraid and take action because of the stress, which is very dangerous to human beings,' said wildlife activist Wang Hui, from Animals Asia, a Hong Kong-based campaigning group. She complained animals were being forced to live side-by-side with those from different continents with how orangutans, which are native to South-east Asia, put next to baby chimpanzees, which hail from Africa. She said there would be little left of the show if the inappropriate parts were lost and was particularly concerned about the unnatural and stressful tasks for the creatures such as making lions socialise with celebrities and having chimpanzees go clothes shopping. Critics also argue it is setting a bad example when in January, the State Forestry Administration issued a notice, forbidding tourists to have close contact with endangered wild animals.

The girlfriend of murdered Russian politician Boris Nemtsov was under armed guard at an unknown location last night, as tens of thousands marched in Moscow in his name. The former deputy prime minister and leading critic of Vladimir Putin was gunned down as he walked home from dinner on Friday with Anna Duritskaya. The model, 23, pleaded to be allowed home to her native Ukraine, but was said to be under police guard yesterday for further questioning. She is understood to have given a description of the killer, despite partial \u2018memory loss\u2019 from \u2018deep shock\u2019, a law enforcement source said. As an \u2018immediate eyewitness\u2019, there were \u2018grounds to conduct additional investigative action regarding her\u2019, the source added. Last night it emerged the head of Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee, Alexander Bastrykin, who will lead inquiries into the murder, is a Putin loyalist with a history of intimidating the Press. He once threatened to behead a journalist and investigate the killing himself. Ukraine\u2019s consul in Moscow, Gennady Breskalenko, said Miss Duritskaya was questioned until 5am on Saturday at the Investigative Committee building, where he had tried to see her. Ostap Semerak, a Ukrainian MP, said the model\u2019s parents were concerned. He said Miss Duritskaya told them by phone that she had \u2018no idea where she is kept\u2019, only that she was \u2018taken to some flat which is guarded, and she is not allowed to leave\u2019. Associates of Mr Nemtsov said she was staying with a friend. The opposition leader had organised the protest against Russia\u2019s involvement in Ukraine, but it became a mourning rally, with chants of \u2018Russia without Putin\u2019. Police claimed 16,000 marched, but observers said there were up to 70,000, with several thousand more in St Petersburg. David Cameron said he was \u2018shocked and sickened by the callous murder\u2019 and that Mr Nemtsov was \u2018dedicated to speaking up tirelessly for the Russian people, demanding their right to democracy and liberty \u2026 and to an end to corruption\u2019. Mr Nemtsov, 55, a former nuclear scientist, rose to prominence under Boris Yeltsin, after the Cold War, becoming deputy prime minister in 1997. Scroll down for video . The 23-year-old model and the opposition leader had dinner in central Moscow before Mr Nemtsov was gunned down on a bridge overlooking St Basil's Cathedral.

Thousands of people took to the streets of Moscow to protest against his murder with any attributing blame to the Russian President . The 55-year-old was shot four times by an unknown killer. He was a vocal critic of Putin throughout his career . After leaving parliament in 2003, he founded opposition movements and was a vocal critic of Mr Putin over Ukraine, the economic crisis and corruption. Voters in Estonia appear to have turned away from a party that supports closer ties with Moscow. Pollsters say first returns, based on online voting, heavily favour the Reform Party of Prime Minister Taavi Roivas, with 37.5 per cent, more than the 28.6 per cent it won in 2011. The opposition Centre Party, which supports closer links with Moscow, had just 7.7 per cent \u2013 compared with the 23.3 per cent it won in 2011. But it is thought these voters have less access to the internet. A married father of four, he is understood to have been with Miss Duritskaya for three years. She was unharmed when he was hit by four of seven bullets fired from a white Lada on a bridge near the Kremlin. Mr Nemtsov had warned that Mr Putin wanted him dead. But the Kremlin strongly denied any official responsibility for the killing. Investigators said they were looking at the possibility he was killed by opposition figures, or that Islamic extremists targeted the Jewish politician. In an interview hours before his murder, Mr Nemtsov accused a \u2018mad\u2019, \u2018aggressive\u2019 Mr Putin of lying over the Ukrainian conflict and called his rule a \u2018catastrophe\u2019.

Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart has revealed he's been working with a psychologist . Hart spoke to Sport magazine about his meetings . Hart told\u00a0Sport\u00a0Magazine: 'I've got a relationship with someone who I've worked with for a while. It's a lot of fun. I like what I get out of it. Just generally \u2013 it's not necessarily just football and trying to 'unlock doors'. 'It's just general \u2013 kind of free-flowing, feeling comfortable and safe to talk. Everyone could benefit from it, really, for life in general.' The goalkeeper feels that having a strong mentality is key to being successful - especially being a goalkeeper. 'You can feel when someone is in a good place and when someone feels good about what they do, the same as I can feel it with strikers. So, to be in a naturally good place is a lot better. 'You've got to believe in what you do and feel comfortable and confident when you go out. Being in the right frame of mind always helps \u2013 we all have vulnerable parts, times in our game when you're thinking the worst can happen. But you need to limit them as best you can.'

England No 1 Joe Hart denies Brazilian ace Neymar as the former Santos man looms down on goal . The England No 1 has been in fine form for his club this season, despite his defence struggling for form, but Hart admitted that making a save isn't quite the feeling as scoring a goal. 'It's a very good feeling,' he says. 'It's a good surge. But the thing with making a save is that you can't run off and slide on your knees.\u00a0Unless you've caught it, you've either pushed it out into play or pushed it for a corner. It's gone. 'As good as making a good save can be, you've got to be aware that five seconds later you can let one through your hands.'

Despite going out of the Champions League on Wednesday, the 27-year-old made a crucial penalty save against Lionel Messi to keep his side well and truly in it after the first leg. 'Penalties are an easy one to zone in on because it's a one-on-one duel. There's nothing that can be done \u2013 it's not like someone can do a sneaky one when you're not looking. 'You try and make the moment as big for them as it is for you. Some people are immune to that, and you're wasting your time. But there's a few people who it might help with. 'Saving one is a good feeling. In my head it's all because of me. But, realistically, they might have just taken a bad penalty or made the wrong decision.

Manuel Pellegrini loftily announces that he has no need to win trophies to keep his job at Manchester City. Brendan Rodgers openly admits that unless he had put Liverpool back in the running for honours he would have been sacked. Louis van Gaal urgently instructs his Manchester United players to minimise passes back to their goalkeeper in an attempt to pacify fans who are demanding a return to the attacking style of Sir Alex Ferguson. Manuel Pellegrini claims he does not need to win trophies to hold on to the Manchester City reins . Louis van Gaal has told his players not to pass back to keeper David de Gea to improve United's tempo . Roberto Martinez airily falls back on the support of his chairman Bill Kenwright as Everton drift, as if rudderless, towards the rapids of the drop zone. Get real, Senors Pellegrini and Martinez. Right on, Mister Rodgers and Meneer Van Gaal. Complacency has never been a recipe for security in the football management game and you begin to fear for Pellegrini and Martinez as the season heads towards the home straight. Pellegrini\u2019s calm intelligence and fine football principles have won our admiration but he is kidding himself if he truly believes it when he says: \u2018I\u2019m not under any pressure to win titles. It\u2019s about playing with style. We won\u2019t change. It\u2019s not about my relationship with the owners. They are not so desperate to win.\u2019 Oh, really? Good luck with that one if after they spend so much money you come up short of Chelsea in your defence of the Premier League title and Barca finish you off in the Champions League. And it didn\u2019t look that good against gallant Leicester on Wednesday night. Martinez comes across as honest \u2013 albeit painfully so at times \u2013 as well as a smooth media operator but he may be taking a little too much for granted when he says: \u2018I was always aware of the support I would get from the chairman.\u2019 Roberto Martinez has suffered second season syndrome at Everton with the Toffees perilously perched . Brendan Rodgers was candid about his chances of survival before Liverpool's remarkable turnaround . Beware the good old vote of confidence, Roberto, and let\u2019s hope you don\u2019t come to re-evaluate something else you\u2019ve just said about Mr Kenwright: \u2018Bill is a mad Evertonian.\u2019 Fanatical fans are not usually very forgiving of only one win in a run of a dozen games including that tepid defeat at Stoke. Rodgers and Van Gaal, meanwhile, are sensibly watching their backs. Not long ago I had occasion to chide Rodgers in this column for doing too much talking about himself but seemingly not enough work on a Liverpool team sliding into crisis. Since then he has seen the warning signs and cleverly switched to a positive 3-4-3 formation which has turned them into the form team of the Premier League and he freely declares now: \u2018I\u2019ve learned that if the team is not functioning it doesn\u2019t matter how much support you have in the boardroom. You have to win.\u2019 So it\u2019s well done to him. Since losing to United on December 14, Liverpool have won nine and drawn three in the Premier League . Van Gaal is proving himself shrewd enough to know that sometimes not even a run of only two defeats in 21 matches is enough at a club as huge as United. The Old Trafford faithful are chanting \u2018attack, attack, attack\u2019 while his raft of expensive imports \u2013 including \u00a360million record signing Angel di Maria \u2013 are struggling to comes to terms with the quick-fire culture of the game in England. And the manager hears them: \u2018I agree with the fans that we don\u2019t have to use the goalkeeper so much. That there are times when we could play at a higher tempo.\u2019 United are approaching a potentially season-defining sequence of matches against Spurs, Liverpool, City and Chelsea in the League and Arsenal in the FA Cup quarter-finals and he promises: \u2018We can improve.\u2019 So it\u2019s well done to him, too. This quartet are not the only managers sweating in the boiler room of big-time football. Heaven knows, for example, what poor old Gus Poyet was burbling on about in his bottle-kicking rant during Sunderland\u2019s fractious draw at Hull this midweek. Or whether his sanity will hold up under the pressure of fighting to stave off relegation without his star England winger Adam Johnson following his arrest on suspicion of having sex with an underage girl. Angel di Maria trudges off to be substituted after another disappointing outing against Newcastle . Hull boss Steve Bruce and Sunderland's Gus Poyet played down their spat and have since shaken hands . The trapdoor is beginning to creak under some auspicious names. Don\u2019t feel too sorry for them if it swings open. Unlike the great managers of yore \u2013 even Sir Alex was financially strapped in his early years astride the hot seat \u2013 these celebrities are paid millions to cope with the pressures. Like several of their more immediate predecessors, they would not necessarily be obliged to find another job after the pay-off. It\u2019s mostly the pride that\u2019s in danger of being hurt. There is one lesson above all others which England\u2019s rugby goliaths need to heed from that Six Nations defeat in Ireland. Brawn alone will not be enough to win the World Cup this autumn, even on home turf. Stuart Lancaster\u2019s pack is a monster, right enough, but you cannot simply shove, bore and batter your way to glory against the best teams on the planet in the Test matches which matter above all others. England will need more than a game based around brute force if they are to succeed in the World Cup . Ireland gave Chris Robshaw his men a lesson and the Red Rose will need to regroup - and add guile . You have to play some football, at least, when it comes to Ireland, probably France, even more so New Zealand. Sir Clive Woodward had Martin Johnson the Enforcer but he also got the sparkling best out of Jonny Wilkinson, whose phenomenal kicking blinded many to his creative talents. Lancaster has Chris Robshaw the Mighty. He also has at his disposal the mercurial genius of Danny Cipriani, who he leaves parked on the bench. There is no reward without risk. There was an awed reaction to my reminiscence earlier this week of how Tottenham\u2019s late, great Dave Mackay refused to believe he had broken his left leg for a second time until he stamped his foot and the jagged white bone stuck out through his sock\u2026then spurned the stretcher and insisted on walking off. So don\u2019t be too surprised if this much loved and revered iron Scot arrives at the funeral on his own two feet.

Fernandez said officers heard the boy scream. At that point they knocked down the door, but by the time they reached a back room, the child and mother had already jumped. Oscar was taken to a hospital, where officials say he is in stable condition and being kept for observation. His mother's injuries were superficial, according to Fernandez.

That's what police officers from Watertown, Massachusetts, described in heart-stopping detail Monday, revealing details of a chaotic shootout with the Boston Marathon bombing suspects. One of the suspects, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, died from injuries he sustained that day -- wounded in a gun battle, then run over by his brother, Dzhokhar. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev managed to escape, but was later caught by police. Now he's on trial, facing 30 charges for the marathon bombings, which killed three people and injured more than 260 others. The shootout with police in the early morning hours of April 19, 2013, marked one of the most dramatic chapters in the manhunt for the suspects who paralyzed the Boston metropolitan area for days. It started, patrolman Joseph Reynolds testified, soon after he locked eyes with Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who he spotted driving an SUV that matched a description of a stolen vehicle. Reynolds called for backup. It wasn't long before Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev were firing guns, throwing bombs and trying to run officers over with a stolen SUV, Reynolds said. \"Tamerlan Tsarnaev got out of the driver's side door and began shooting at my cruiser,\" Reynolds said. Soon, the officer said he ran out of bullets. Sgt. Jeffrey Pugliese saw what looked like muzzle flashes as soon as he arrived at the scene. \"I put my vehicle in park, I took a round through the windshield, I was sprayed with glass and I knew, OK, we were being fired on,\" said Sgt. John MacLellan. Then the two brothers began throwing improvised explosives, including pipe bombs and a pressure cooker bomb, the officers testified. \"I noticed one was bigger than the other, and they had different styles when they were throwing the devices,\" MacLellan said. \"One was throwing like a baseball.\" MacLellan said the pressure cooker bomb \"was incredibly loud. I had to holster my weapon. My eyes were shaking violently in my head. I couldn't see.\" Pugliese said he opened fire when he saw one of the men, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, charging toward him. Pugliese fired and the man threw his pistol at the officer, hitting him in the bicep. Pugliese tackled him. And with Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was wounded from gunfire, on the ground, the three officers tried to put him in handcuffs. They thought they'd be able to arrest him. But then something changed. \"We were wrestling with Tamerlan, and all of a sudden I could hear an engine revving,\" Reynolds said . The SUV, Reynolds said, was heading straight toward the officers. The dramatic descriptions of the shootout Monday sounded like a scene from a Hollywood film, said Boston Globe columnist Kevin Cullen. But the most extraordinary revelation in court, he said, was that the night could have ended very differently. \"Dzhokhar Tsarnaev did not have to go back and run his brother over. He actually did a three-point turn and reversed the vehicle. He could have sped off and run away,\" Cullen told CNN's \"The Lead with Jake Tapper.\" He was in a much better position to flee. But apparently he decided to do a U-turn and come back.\" The sight of the stolen SUV speeding toward them caught the officers by surprise. \"I reached down and I grabbed Tamerlan by the back of the belt and tried to drag him out of the street so he wouldn't be hit,\" Pugliese said. \"The black SUV, it was right in my face. ... I kind of laid back and felt the wind from the vehicle as it went by.\" But they didn't move Tamerlan in time. His body became hung up in the rear wheels and he was dragged a short distance, Pugliese said. The prosecutor asked Pugliese if there was something in the road that forced the SUV driver to go directly at the officers. \"No,\" he said. \"It was accelerating at a very high rate of speed.\" Later that day, Tamerlan Tsarnaev was pronounced dead at a local hospital, with the cause listed as \"traumatic injuries\" to the head and torso. His fingerprints led to the identification of the suspects. Officers discovered that Richard Donohue, a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority officer, had been hit by friendly fire during the shootout. He survived, but nearly bled to death. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was arrested about 8:45 p.m. that same day, hiding in a boat called the \"Slip Away\" that was stowed in a backyard in Watertown. Jurors saw photos of the boat last week. But on Monday, they got a chance to see the boat, which has become a key piece of evidence in the trial, in person. Before the trial started, prosecutors and defense attorneys had sparred over how much of the boat jurors would get to see. The prosecution sought to remove a panel on which Tsarnaev allegedly scrawled incriminating messages so that jurors could see it with their own eyes. Defense attorney David Bruck argued that cutting out a panel would take the written words out of context and wouldn't fairly reflect Tsarnaev's state of mind. In South Boston, about a mile from the courthouse, jurors intently looked at the entire boat Monday. It had been loaded onto a semi truck and moved to the location for viewing by the jury. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, wearing a dark jacket and no handcuffs or shackles, watched the jurors but showed little emotion or expression. Jurors appeared to strain to make out the words Tsarnaev scrawled inside the boat. The boat was riddled with more than 100 bullet holes -- some of which punctured Tsarnaev's words. Aaron Cooper reported from Boston. Catherine E. Shoichet and Ralph Ellis wrote the story in Atlanta.

A new book promises to show you how to take back a little bit of peace, space and all-important calm in just a few simple steps . Anxiety affects one in six people in the UK with am estimated 70 per cent of GP visits being due to stress-related issues. According to author Michael Acton Smith, we can do little things every single day to combat this. His book combines extracts from neurological research with wisdom from history's great thinkers and the real-life experiences of individuals across the globe. From how you decorate your house to changing your computer password, FEMAIL has selected the best bits from Calm to help you live a more successful life. 1.\u00a0Change your password, change your life How many times a day do you re-enter your computer password? Having to change our passwords constantly is one of the exasperating necessities of office life. But what if you were to reappropriate your password, using it instead as a modern-day mantra to help you ensure you remain mindful of whatever it is you most want to achieve? This could be BU!LDNEWFRI3NDSHIPS or SAVE4SKIING. The joy of it is that you can alter it every month if you like. It's an opportunity to repeatedly hit your subconscious with a mindful reminder. 2. Nature meditation\u00a0Sit in a quiet space. Imagine you are sat beneath a tree in the middle of a field or forest beneath a large, leafy tree with strong branches. Smell the rich soil and clean air. Listen to the wind rustling through the leaves and notice if you hear any birds or animals stirring within. Visualise the tree's leaves, branches and trunk, then picture yourself reaching out to touch it. Feel the texture of the bark. Imagine the tree drinking up the water through its complex root system. Visualise the lengthening, spreading branches, and the leaves opening towards the sun. 3. Create a sleep-friendly bedroom Keep your bedroom decor simple and calm. Avoid clutter, which can trigger your stress response, and make sure work papers are out of sight. Changing your password to something useful or calming is an opportunity to repeatedly hit your subconscious with a mindful reminder . 4. Invest in blue furnishings Opt for blue walls, or flashes of blue in soft furnishings: looking at this colour can lead to a drop in heart rate and blood pressure, and gentle blue hues are widely believed to have a sleep-inducing effect. 5. Keep a notepad or journal by your bed\u00a0Then, instead of lying awake, worried you will forget something in the morning, you can write it down and allow the thought to pass. Opt for blue walls, or flashes of blue in soft furnishings: looking at this colour can lead to a drop in heart rate and blood pressure . 6. Imagine a nature scene If your'e struggling to get to sleep, try imagining a tranquil natural scene, whether it's a bucolic rural landscape or the gently lapping waves of the shore of a beautiful lake. Researchers from the University of Oxford found that when volunteers imagined such scenes, they fell asleep an average of twenty minutes earlier than those who didn't use the technique. 7. Design your dream island If you were to design a whole island for yourself, a place that had the specific purpose of helping you to feel as calm as possible, what would you put on it? Write about it and draw it. Revisit this place whenever you get stressed, embellishing the details and adding new, calming features over time. 8. Make a list of the ten people who make you happiest\u00a0This list could be anyone from friends to inspiring writers or thinkers. Look at it regularly (why not take a snap on your phone to keep it to hand), and whenever you feel stress kick in, pick up your phone and call one, or open a book to absorb their wisdom. 9. Let out a sigh An emphatic 'aaah' or 'ommmm' will combat the restricted feeling that sometimes settles in your chest at the end of a stressful day, and the vibration and deep breath will energise you. 10. Three things that make you happy\u00a0Every night before you go to bed, write a list of three things that made you happy that day. If you have a child, ask them to do it. It's a great way to reinforce a healthy self-image and a positive mindset, and ensure they go to sleep with happy thoughts in their heads. It has the added benefit that you get to hear a bit about their day and the things that genuinely bring them joy. 11. Eat a single square of chocolate mindfully Eat a square of chocolate so mindfully that you pay attention to everything, from the sounds of the wrapper to the smell of it and the feeling against your tongue. Focussing on taste in this way forces your sense to wake up. 12.

Using macroscopic photography, Russian photographer Nick Lariontsev has created a captivating yet stomach-churning timelapse video that shows mould fungi as it grows and spread (grab shown) The multicellular filaments slowly spread across the Petri dish before forming mounds and ridges that look more like the alien landscape of another planet. He has also managed to capture the tiny clusters of spores on the end of stalks that give many moulds their dusty appearance. Mr Lariontsev, a photographer based in Russia who posted the video on YouTube, said it took him between two and eight days to capture each of the individual sequences in the film. Among the moulds he filmed using a specially designed set-up was part of the Aspergillus genus, which commonly forms on starchy foods and are also used to help produce sake from rice. Among the moulds in the film are the Aspergillus genus, which commonly forms on starchy foods and are also used to help produce sake from rice.\u00a0The fungi Cladosporium, which usually grows on dead plant material, are also shown growing their brown and black branches, and the soil-based fungi Trichoderma . Fungi from the group of Cladosporium, which usually grows on dead plant material, are also shown growing their brown and black branches, along with the soil-based fungi Trichoderma. The fungal genus Botrytis, some of which often infect soft fruit like strawberries and grapes, and the genus Mucor, which grow on rotting vegetation, were also captured. Mr Lariontsev set up the Petri dish where he grew his mould so that it would slowly rotate - making one turn every seven days. The result is a rather stomach-churning but strangely captivating four-minute long video showing the fungi as few people will have seen it before. Professor Lynne Boddy, a fungal ecologist at Cardiff University and a member of the British Mycological Society, said: 'Most people think yuk when they see fungi as they see it rot their food and kill their plants. 'But if it wasn't for fungi we would not be here today as it shapes the world around us. 'If fungi did not rot wood and leaves in the forest, then the nutrients locked up inside them would never be freed up in the soil. 'Many fungi also form mycorrhizal relationships with the roots of plants and if it was not for them then the plants could not grow. 'Fungi are actually hugely important yet largely overlooked.' The fungi Botrytis, which often infects on soft fruit like strawberries and grapes, and the fungi Mucor, which grows on rotting vegetation, were also captured.

It sounds more like the recipe  for a good pasta sauce, but scientists have created a new edible coating that extends the shelf-life of cheese from seafood, rosemary and oregano. The transparent film uses extracts from the shells of crustaceans with oregano and rosemary oils to keep cheese from drying out and help prevent the growth of fungus and bacteria. Tests have shown that the coating is as effective as anti-fungal chemicals and plastic coatings that are currently used to protect some cheeses by the dairy industry. The researchers claim that the new coating will be particularly useful for soft cheeses like ricotta but could also help prevent mature cheeses like brie and blue cheeses from spoiling. While helping to prevent the cheese from going off, it is also completely edible and so will not need to be removed like some artificial rinds that are used. Professor Chelo Gonz\u00e1lez, a researcher at the Institute of Food Engineering for Development of the\u00a0Polytechnic University of Valencia, said:\u00a0'The most common causes of deterioration are excessive surface dehydration and the growth of micro-organisms such as fungus or yeasts.

A trusted church treasurer who stole \u00a320,000 from a renovation pot to fund his gambling habit has narrowly avoided jail. Mark Conway-Wilcox, 30,\u00a0of Newbiggin Hall, Newcastle, admitted four counts of theft after stealing from St Wilfrid's Church's - but claimed the amount he had taken was closer to \u00a315,000. Yesterday he was branded 'unchristian' for leaving the Newcastle church on the brink of closure after stealing the money and blowing it on gambling. Newcastle Crown Court heard Conway-Wilcox also failed to pay various bills, had creditors chasing the church and\u00a0even left it potentially uninsured. The court heard Conway-Wilcox became treasurer at St Wilfrid's in May\u00a02013 and was responsible for making sure money was put in the bank and invoices were\u00a0paid. After receiving complaints about unpaid bills Reverend Sarah Miller initially gave\u00a0Conway-Wilcox the benefit of the doubt. But matters came to a head in May last year when Ecclesiastical Insurance\u00a0rang up and told her they had not been paid and that the church and its contents\u00a0were potentially uninsured. An investigation began and it was discovered Conway-Wilcox had transferred\u00a0\u00a310,098 from the church's refurbishment account into his own between\u00a0November 2013 and May 2014. A further \u00a3550 had been moved from church bank accounts to his account and Conway-Wilcox failed to bank more than \u00a310,000 in cheques. Prosecutor Kevin Wardlaw told the court the total amount misappropriated was \u00a320,856.78. The church has since been paid back \u00a310,000 by the insurance company. St Wilfrid's Church in\u00a0Newbiggin Hall, Newcastle, was left in danger of closure after Conway-Wilcox failed to pay various bills, had creditors chasing the church and even left it potentially uninsured . Paul Caulfield, defending, told the court: 'He had a horrendous gambling problem, referred himself for help and has attended 20 sessions. 'Since this matter came to light he has not been involved in gambling. 'He is mortified by his conduct and apologises publicly, having apologised\u00a0privately previously.' Recorder Nicholas\u00a0Lumley QC told Conway-Wilcox: 'This church serves one of this great city's less\u00a0fortunate areas and it has a small but committed congregation. 'The church, its fabric and its good work was placed in jeopardy by you. 'And why? Well, because of your greed. You saw them as a soft target and a\u00a0ready source of cash for your own frailties and you plundered what money\u00a0they had. 'You took advantage of your position of trust by stealing from various bank\u00a0accounts and when it was queried you stalled, prevaricated and lied. 'Not only is it unchristian it is thoroughly dishonest.' Newcastle Crown Court heard Conway-Wilcox left the Newcastle church on the brink of closure . Martin Sheppard, of the Diocese of\u00a0Newcastle, said: 'It's been a very sad story for Martin, for his family and the church family at Newbiggin Hall. It's been a very difficult time for the congregation. 'We don't understand why he did what he did. Everyone feels great sorrow and regret. 'As I understand it, the money that was taken was money that people had been collecting for the renovation work for a church hall facility in the Newbiggin Hall area. 'The money was collected by faithful members of the church and now they have been set back in their project to serve the community where they live,work and worship.' Conway-Wilcox was handed an eight month prison sentence, suspended for two years, with 200 hours of unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay \u00a35,000 compensation to St Wilfrid's.", "reference": "Treasurer Mark Conway-Wilcox, 30, stole \u00a320,000 to fund gambling habit .\nStole money from\u00a0St Wilfrid's Church's renovation fund and bank account .\nChurch faced closure after it was\u00a0revealed\u00a0he had not paid the insurance .\nHe also failed to pay various bills and had creditors chasing the church .\nConway-Wilcox has now been handed a suspended prison sentence .\nHe was yesterday branded 'unchristian' 'greedy' and 'dishonest' by a judge ."}, "40": {"id": "cf807fe40e4e2f493721a300193bbc70ca8b7523", "article": "At 18 years old, Christie Swadling's biggest concern should be her subject quota at university. But instead she is battling an ongoing eating disorder and advocating a healthy diet to other young sufferers. 'Photoshopped adverts of models like Miranda Kerr definitely started off my body image issues because you think that's how you're meant to be,' Christie told Daily Mail Australia. 'I became skinnier than those models and because of my disease, stopped thinking about the models altogether and became obsessed with just losing more and more weight.' The social media motivator has had over 630,000 views on her 'Anorexia Nervosa nearly killed me' video on YouTube and has more than 8,000 followers on Instagram, illustrating her arduous journey from anorexia to finally gaining weight and then her changing her relationship with food.

As a young girl, Christie was bullied for being 'chubby' and told to 'go back to Maccas' Christie wants to tell her story to others in order to motivate them to improve their quality of life . She collapsed due to malnutrition on her 17th birthday and was in and out of hospital constantly . Christie's struggle began in primary school when she was bullied for being 'chubby' due to her unhealthy diet. 'My family never had a healthy diet, I was always the kid that everyone was jealous of as I had the chocolate, the chips, the McDonald's,' she said. 'I got chubby at a young age and was bigger than all my friends.' The teenager from East Gosford, New South Wales, about an hour and half north of Sydney, was mocked for her weight and called names like 'thick' and was constantly told by high school bullies to 'go back to Maccas.' It was at this time that Christie began to exercise. She had no energy and a terrible relationship with food and even stopped being able to get out of bed . Christie is pictured here (left) at one of her thinnest points but she is now on the mend and has gained over ten kgs (right) 'I was eating next to nothing, maybe two meals less than 300 calories and there was a devil in my head telling me to be skinny constantly,' she said . Motivated by her healthy, soccer-playing dad, she began to play different sports and found happiness there. It wasn't until severe dieting began that Christie ran into trouble and she lost the ability to walk and became bed-ridden. 'It became a problem when I lost a lot of weight - 13 kilogram, I realised I was smaller than Miranda and one moment I liked it and then I didn't like it at all. Her weight dwindled down to nearly 30 kilograms and she lost all energy . 'I was eating next to nothing, maybe two meals less than 300 calories and there was a devil in my head telling me to be skinny constantly.'

Christie has 8000 followers on Instagram and posts images of the healthy meals she consumes . She is now doing yoga and pilates to build her strength after being so weak during the peak her illness . In her new Youtube video, Christie shows what she now consumes during the day . Her family did not notice her internal battle until it began to show physically, prompting her  mother to take her to a doctor. 'I ticked some boxes and they said: 'OK, you have an eating disorder', so they gave me some tips and told me to come back in three months,' Christie said. Christie got steadily worse after her diagnosis and was admitted to hospital where again her condition stabilised and she was released. It wasn't until she was admitted to hospital for the third time after she collapsed on her 17th birthday that she began to change her thoughts toward food and started eating properly. A happier and healthier Christie now enjoys her time with her family and friends and does not worry as much about her body image . Christie aims to help others by advocating a healthy lifestyle on her Facebook, Instagram, Youtube and blog . Now improving, the NSW-based teen hopes to help others with same battle . 'I looked in the mirror and felt disgusted at what I saw and became aware that I was slowly killing myself,' she said. 'I just started eating and eating and eating, it was that easy.'

The teen said the support he has received following the 'physically painful' Facebook conversation has lifted his spirits and helped him think positively, adding: 'I have no time for tears.' Tyler, whose  mother and two  sisters still live with his father, said: 'I haven't heard from my father at all. I moved out to my aunt's house a few weeks after he sent the messages. 'He sent them a week after I came out during December, and I haven't spoken to him since then. The rest of my family were kind of blown away by how much attention [the photos] have drawn.

'We loved you, took care of you when you\u2019re sick. Lost many days and nights in all your fifteen years. Now this is what we get in return, shame and embarrassment. 'If only you didn't reject God and His teachings in your life you could have been strong enough to stay from evil and scums that surrounds you. Stay away.'

Many other systems have \u2018super-Earths\u2019 and other planets in tight orbits close to their star, but ours does not. And now we might know why - because Jupiter acted like a \u2018wrecking ball\u2019 in the early solar system and knocked planets out of the solar system or into position. University of California scientists have presented a new theory for the solar system. They say early in its life, Jupiter swung through the inner planets (illustration of early solar system shown). This explains why there are no planets between Mercury and the sun. But it may also indicate our system is an 'oddball' in the galaxy . If this is true, it would suggest that the conditions that have allowed life on Earth to thrive are incredibly rare. The study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences helps explain why our solar system is so different from the hundreds of others discovered in recent years. \u2018Now we can look at our own solar system in the context of all these other planetary systems, one of the most interesting features is the absence of planets inside the orbit of Mercury,\u2019 said Professor Gregory Laughlin, of California University in Santa Cruz, who co-authored the study. \u2018The standard issue planetary system in our galaxy seems to be a set of super-Earths with alarmingly short orbital periods. Our solar system is looking increasingly like an oddball.\u2019 Aliens are real - not little green men visiting Earth as depicted in movies, but rather microbial life in our own solar system and intelligent life beyond. That\u2019s according to two leading Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (Seti) researchers, who took part in a hearing at the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology in Washington DC last August. During the talk dubbed \u2018Astrobiology and the Search for Life in the Universe\u2019 in May, the scientists laid out the evidence and reasoning for believing we are not alone. The speech was made by Dr Seth Shostak, Senior Astronomer at the Seti Institute in California, and Dr Dan Wethimer, Director of Seti Research. And, they added, with adequate support it is likely we will find alien life in some form or another within 20 years. Dr Wethimer said: \u2018It would be bizarre if we are alone,\u2019 he told the committee. \u2018It would be a cramped mind that didn\u2019t wonder what other life is out there.\u2019 The new findings provide an explanation for this \u2018gaping hole\u2019 in our inner solar system between Mercury and the sun. But they also reveal certain characteristics of Earth and the other rocky planets, which would have formed later than the outer ones from a depleted supply of material. Namely, Jupiter may have helped Earth form in a habitable part of the solar system. And it also possibly played a part in Earth's size, ensuring it was not too big or small to host water and life. Computer models of the early solar system showed the migration of Jupiter may have shepherded small early planets - initiating a \u2018collisional cascade\u2019 in the inner solar system. Before this it\u2019s plausible that rocky planets with deep atmospheres would have been forming close to the sun from a dense disk of gas and dust on their way to becoming typical \u2018super-Earths\u2019 like so many of the planets astronomers have found around other stars. As Jupiter moved inward, gravitational perturbations from the giant planet would have swept the inner planets and large space rocks into close-knit overlapping orbits - setting off a series of collisions that smashed all the planets into pieces. \u2018It\u2019s the same thing we worry about if satellites were to be destroyed in low-Earth orbit,\u2019 said Professor Laughlin. \u2018Their fragments would start smashing into other satellites and you\u2019d risk a chain reaction of collisions. \u2018Our work indicates that Jupiter would have created just such a collisional cascade in the inner solar system.\u2019 As Jupiter (pictured from the Cassini spacecraft on 8 October 2000) moved inward in the early solar system, gravitational perturbations from the giant planet would have swept the inner planets and large space rocks into close-knit overlapping orbits - setting off a series of collisions that smashed all the planets into pieces . The study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences helps explain why our solar system is so different from the hundreds of others discovered in recent years. Notably, many other systems have super-Earths (illustration shown) - but our solar system has none . The resulting debris would then have spiraled into the sun under the influence of a strong \u2018headwind\u2019 from the dense gas still swirling around the sun. \u2018The ingoing avalanche would have destroyed any newly-formed super-Earths by driving them into the sun,\u2019 said Professor Laughlin. A second generation of inner planets would have formed later from the depleted material that was left behind, consistent with evidence that our solar system\u2019s inner planets are younger than the outer planets. The resulting inner planets - Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars - are also less massive and have much thinner atmospheres than would otherwise be expected. \u2018One of the predictions of our theory is that truly Earth-like planets - with solid surfaces and modest atmospheric pressures - are rare,\u2019 added Professor Laughlin. Ultimately, Jupiter's interaction with the inner solar system billions of years ago may have given rise to the solar system we know today (illustrated) - and also the conditions necessary for life on Earth, namely a habitable distance from the sun and a suitably-sized world . Planet hunters have detected well over a thousand exoplanets orbiting stars in our galaxy, including nearly 500 systems with multiple planets. What has emerged from these observations as the \u2018typical\u2019 planetary system is one consisting of a few planets with masses several times larger than the Earth\u2019s - super-Earths - orbiting much closer to their host star than Mercury is to the sun. In systems with giant planets similar to Jupiter, they also tend to be much closer to their host stars than the giant planets in our solar system. The rocky inner planets of our solar system, with relatively low masses and thin atmospheres, may turn out to be fairly anomalous. According to Professor Laughlin, the formation of giant planets like Jupiter is somewhat rare, but when it occurs the giant planet usually migrates inward and ends up at an orbital distance similar to Earth\u2019s. Only the formation of Saturn in our own solar system pulled Jupiter back out and allowed Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars to form. Therefore, another prediction of the paper is that systems with giant planets at orbital periods of more than about 100 days would be unlikely to host multiple close-in planets.", "reference": "University of California has present a new theory for solar system .\nThey say early in its life, Jupiter swung through the inner planets .\nThis explains why there are no planets between Mercury and the sun .\nBut it may also indicate our system is an 'oddball' in the galaxy .\nAnd it may mean conditions for life on Earth were extremely rare ."}, "46": {"id": "c6a89b15bcef33a7ad7ebfecc3764b39cf95e3e7", "article": "Bordeaux captain Lamine Sane has issued a come-and-get-me plea to Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers by revealing he would be keen on sealing a move to Anfield.

Busch was accused by Patricia Driscoll of grabbing her by the throat and slamming her head against the wall in his motor home at Dover International Speedway in September. \"After a thorough consideration of all of the available information about the case, it is determined that the admissible evidence and available witnesses would likely be insufficient to meet the burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Busch committed a crime during the September 26th incident,\" Delaware Department of Justice public information officer Carl Kanefsky said in a statement. \"Likelihood of meeting that high burden of proof is the standard for prosecutors in bringing a case. For this reason, the Department of Justice will not pursue criminal charges in this case.\" In a statement Thursday, Busch said he is grateful that the prosecutors decided not to file charges. \"I wish to thank my family, friends, fans, and race team who stood by me throughout this nightmare with their unwavering support,\" Busch said. \"Thanks also goes to my legal team for making sure that the truth got out and was fully provided to the prosecutors.  As I have said from the beginning, I did not commit domestic abuse. I look forward to being back in racing as soon as possible and moving on with my life.\" While Busch will not be charged, he must stay away from Driscoll for one year, a Kent County, Delaware, family court commissioner ruled in February. Driscoll had requested a no-contact order against Busch. Stemming from the family court ruling, NASCAR suspended Busch indefinitely shortly before the Daytona 500. That decision was upheld after appeal. CNN has reached out to NASCAR for an update on Busch's status but did not immediately hear back. \"Patricia and I are very disappointed that Kurt will not be prosecuted for the abusive acts he committed in September,\" Driscoll's attorney, Carolyn McNeice, said Thursday. \"The (attorney general's) decision, however, only makes the order that we received for protection from abuse that much more important. \"As you can see, in some cases, this is the only protection the victim will get. This civil no contact order is a critical tool for protecting victims.\" Busch's attorney, Rusty Hardin, previously has said that he would appeal the family court ruling and would continue to work to clear Busch's name. At the no-contact hearing, Busch testified that he believes Driscoll is a trained assassin for the U.S. government and that she once showed up wearing a gown covered in blood.

Taking center stage this week -- videotape never before seen in public, taken from Hernandez's own home security system. Prosecutors are using that grainy footage to suggest Hernandez is holding a .45-caliber handgun -- the same kind police say was used to kill Lloyd. Hernandez is seen on camera pulling into his driveway minutes after Lloyd was shot to death in an industrial park about a mile from Hernandez' Boston home. \"In my opinion, the firearm shown in the video stills is a Glock pistol,\" Glock sales manager Kyle Aspinwall testifies. Hernandez, Ernest Wallace, and Carlos Ortiz are seen on the same security video, recorded at about 3:30 a.m. on June 17, 2013, after the men walk into Hernandez's home. All three have been charged with murder in the death of Lloyd and have pleaded not guilty. Wallace and Ortiz are being tried separately. The video is time-stamped minutes after workers in a nearby industrial park describe hearing loud noises like fireworks -- the moment prosecutors say Lloyd was gunned down after getting out of a car driven by Hernandez. Jurors lean forward in their chairs, peering into monitors and scribbling notes as Aspinwall, a former Massachusetts state trooper and New Hampshire police chief, takes them frame by frame through video during two days of testimony. Aspinwall tells jurors Hernandez appears to be holding the pistol by its muzzle as he's standing at his basement door. The defense will have none of it. They attack Aspinwall's credentials. Aspinwall is well-schooled in Glocks but admits he doesn't consider himself a gun identification expert. Hernandez's lawyers then show a different part of the video time-stamped a few seconds earlier with Hernandez holding what appears to be a shiny object in one hand, suggesting it may be an iPad. \"Glock pistols don't have white glows to them, do they?\" defense attorney James Sultan asks. \"No, they do not,\" Aspinwall answers. Sultan then displays a soft-pellet gun similar in shape to a Glock, suggesting it could also be the object Hernandez is holding. Prosecutors dispute the suggestion. \"Are you aware of anybody going pellet gun shooting at 3:30 in the morning?\" Bristol County Assistant District Attorney Patrick Bomberg asks Aspinwall. University of New Hampshire law professor Michael McCann calls the Glock expert's findings powerful; yet, he thinks the defense did a solid job of raising questions about the fuzzy video. \"The jury might think that the defense is just throwing things against the wall,\" he says. \"But on the other hand, the jury may feel like it could be one of a dozen things. That's reasonable doubt.\" One thing not in dispute: the alleged murder weapon remains missing. So does a solid motive. Prosecutors could be laying the groundwork for showing more surveillance video of Hernandez -- who at the time was a star receiver for the New England Patriots -- partying with Lloyd and Hernandez's personal barber at Rumor nightclub two nights before Lloyd's death. Investigators say Hernandez was angry that Lloyd was talking to some people that night. Hernandez and Lloyd are not seen together on a camera pointed at the club's bar, and they appear to be separated for a time when they leave, but so far there's no testimony about what may have gone wrong. What might Hernandez's fianc\u00e9e say? Akil Joseph, a longtime friend of Lloyd's who takes the stand, tells jurors he talked with Lloyd at the club and says he appeared \"normal.\" When Azil Joseph leaves the stand, he keeps his eyes locked on Hernandez until he walks past the defense table. Cameras show Hernandez leaving the bar, but they do not show the moment when a parking valet testified he saw what he believed to be a gun in Hernandez's waistband. The valet's hotel security boss tells jurors he didn't see a weapon under the football player's shirt. Near the club, Hernandez is in his SUV with Lloyd and another friend. Hernandez offers a ride to Jennifer Fortier, his babysitter, who happened to be nearby with a friend. Fortier tells jurors Hernandez and Lloyd were smoking pot. Despite her objections, Hernandez drives her and the friend to Hernandez's so-called \"flophouse\" about 20 minutes from Gillette Stadium, the Patriots' home field in Foxborough. Fortier testifies that Hernandez \"tried kissing me.\" \"I told him 'No, I'm your nanny. I can't do this,'\" she adds. \"He said he understood ... and he wasn't mad at me.\"", "reference": "Aaron Hernandez on trial for death of Odin Lloyd .\nTestimony focused on security video from Hernandez's home .\nDebate over whether Hernandez holding gun or electronic device ."}, "49": {"id": "20193b543d884703efb49bc1b1520594b2069371", "article": "Washington (CNN)It doesn't matter how many times Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu now says he still wants a two-state solution with the Palestinians. The White House is refusing to take him at his word. \"We take him at his word when he said that it wouldn't happen during his prime ministership, and so that's why we've got to evaluate what other options are available to make sure that we don't see a chaotic situation in the region,\" President Barack Obama said in an interview with The Huffington Post published Saturday. These are the President's first public comments since Netanyahu's party captured the most seats in Tuesday's parliamentary election. Netanyahu has said in at least three post-election interviews that he still believes in Palestinian statehood, despite his pre-election flip-flop on the issue in what experts called a desperate appeal for conservative votes. Only on Thursday, two days after the election, did President Obama congratulate Netanyahu by phone on his victory. White House press secretary Josh Earnest declined to say whether Netanyahu clarified his position on the two-state policy during that phone call. But Obama told the Prime Minister that the United States would \"reassess\" aspects of its relationship with Israel after Netanyahu's earlier provocative statements opposing the creation of a Palestinian state. Administration officials have said the United States is now considering signing on to a U.N. resolution which supports a Palestinian state. Regarding comments Netanyahu made Tuesday about Arab Israeli voters going to the polls \"in droves\" -- comments described by some as racist -- Obama told The Huffington Post that that kind of \"rhetoric\" was \"contrary to what is best of Israel's traditions. That although Israel was founded based on the historic Jewish homeland and the need to have a Jewish homeland, Israeli democracy has been premised on everybody in the country being treated equally and fairly.\" Obama added: \"If that is lost, then I think that not only does it give ammunition to folks who don't believe in a Jewish state, but it also I think starts to erode the name of democracy in the country.\" U.S. House Speaker John Boehner, who invited Netanyahu to address that controversial joint meeting of Congress earlier this month, plans to visit Israel at the end of the month.

He said: 'Victor was immediately on his guard when he realised another polar bear was there. But after a roar or two he settled down. Once released in the enclosure Pixel immediately took a dip following his long journey from the Netherlands . To his obvious delight the polar bear caught a fish in the large pond within his enclosure . 'Once Pixel is settled in the plan will be to introduce them together as soon as possible.

Mr Marsh added: 'Polar bears are an iconic species that are increasingly threatened in their native habitat and we need to fight their cause. 'Their native sea ice is disappearing due to climate change but we still have a chance to do something about it and at Project Polar we can share with visitors how they can help.

Mr Bercow said a 'not inconsequential sum of public money' was needed to keep the Palace of Westminster 'fit for purpose'. He said it would be a 'huge pity' to have to leave the Commons and Lords, but experts have warned up to \u00a33billion of repairs to the crumbling building are needed. John Bercow said a 'not inconsequential sum of public money' was needed to keep the Palace of Westminster 'fit for purpose' Among the problems are leaking roofs and pipes, ancient electrics and plumbing, asbestos, subsidence, badly-damaged stonework and fire risks. Speaking in Westminster Mr Bercow said: 'This is a fabulous institution located in awesome surroundings. It must not have the ethos of a museum. 'It will require bold and imaginative managerial leadership to ensure that we are a Parliament fit for purpose and that this Victorian legacy can be rendered practical for contemporary representation.' Referring to the blaze that burned down the old palace of Westminster in 1834, Mr Bercow said: 'It would be a huge pity if we decided that by the time we had reached the 200th anniversary of the vast fire which consumed the old parliament and brought this one in to being, we had to abandon this site and look elsewhere in order to serve the public interest properly.' He added: 'Yet I will tell you in all candour that unless management of the very highest quality and a not inconsequential sum of public money are deployed on this estate over the next 10 years, that will be the outcome.'

The cost of repairing the Houses of Parliament could top \u00a33billion, an examination of options for renovating the historic building has suggested . Here is just some of the work that needs to be done to the Houses of Parliament to prevent a \u2018looming crisis\u2019: . ASBESTOS . The walls and floors are infested with the dangerous substance - putting all occupants of the Palace at risk. ELECTRICS . Much of the building needs re-wiring, and generators do not produce enough power . VENTILATION . Many original shafts are filled with wires, and a major failure of the ventilation system is judged to be inevitable. HEATING . Many boilers date from the 1930s, pipes are clogged with limescale and are in danger of fracturing \u2013 causing dangerous steam leaks which could close the Commons chamber for months . FLOODING . Faulty guttering and broken pipes cause regular flooding, and the Big Ben belfry is particularly badly affected by water penetration. Walls are damp and stained. LEAKY ROOFS . A problem throughout the Palace, particularly as cast-iron roofs are coming to the end of their life. DANGEROUS CEILINGS . Several pieces of wood fall from the fourteenth-century roof of Westminster Hall every year, while in 1980 a heavy boss fell from the roof of the House of Lords chamber . DRAINAGE . Pipes and culverts seriously overloaded because they are now expected to deal with more waste than expected. Dr Richard Ware said last year that it was ''not unreasonable'' to think the bill could top \u00a32 billion, but BBC2's Newsnight programme claimed that the ''working assumption'' of insiders was that it could be a billion more. The Speaker also addressed the 'agony' of the controversial process to recruit a new clerk for the House of Commons, insisting he had always believed that splitting the role in two was the right way to proceed. Mr Bercow led an appointment panel in an external search to replace Sir Robert Rogers, who retired early as clerk last summer after a 40-year Commons career. The proposed appointment of Australian official Carol Mills was abandoned by Mr Bercow after protests from MPs that she was not able to do the job because she had no knowledge of Commons procedure. A committee led by former cabinet minister Jack Straw recommended splitting the role, with a director general responsible for administration and the clerk left to manage the constitutional and parliamentary elements. Mr Bercow said: 'On taking extensive evidence, they could see that the management of the House was simply not fit for purpose and they set out constructive proposals to equip us for the modern world. 'I am absolutely ecstatic that they reached the conclusions that they did, that they managed to obtain unanimity for their recommendations and that their findings were then accepted by colleagues without dissent in the debate in December and the legislation that came before the House last week. 'My one regret about all this is that it was not possible to find the consensus required to commission the Straw Committee a year earlier, because if we had it would have saved us the utter agony of a doomed first attempt. 'Finding a human being who was a parliamentary expert of the highest repute and a chief executive of stellar managerial form proved predictably impossible. 'Now that the role has rightly been separated - I argued all along that the clerk should not also be the chief executive and this has now been agreed by the House - I am confident that we will be able to find a clerk of the House whose constitutional qualifications would make Erskine May proud and a director general who can take on, full-time, the management of the Commons.' The Speaker also set out his plans for greater public involvement in the work of the Commons. He said: 'Democracy needs not only to be done but to be seen to be done to enjoy the weight it deserves. Reconnecting Parliament and the public is thus not some sort of public relations exercise but absolutely central to its status.' Mr Bercow said he was 'intrigued' by the recommendation of the Digital Democracy Commission for online public 'e-discussions' before debates in Westminster Hall, the Commons' second chamber. The Speaker also repeated his criticism of the way Prime Minister's Questions was conducted, and called for the party leaders to improve the tone of the exchanges. He said: 'PMQs are what the public see and hear of Parliament more than anything else. 'My submission, supported anecdotally wherever I go around the country and by some polling evidence, is that the public disapprove of the decibel level and orchestrated barracking. 'Put simply, if the party leaders want conduct on a Wednesday lunchtime to improve, it will. Post-election there will be an opportunity to achieve change that the public would welcome.'", "reference": "Speaker John Bercow warns of major bill needed to renovate Parliament .\nHe said it would be a 'huge pity' to have to leave the Commons and Lords .\nBut  Houses of Parliament may have to be abandoned within 20 years .\nOfficials fear the building will not survive without significant investment .\nLeaking pipes, subsidence, asbestos and outdated electrics among issues .\nLast major renovation in 1940s when German bomb damage was dealt with ."}, "54": {"id": "ba6a1a0a13d6b881d31d76123242437515f2a4e6", "article": "A nurse who works an Atlanta hospital stepped in to assist an eight-year-old girl and her mother running a 5K race over the weekend.

The Welsh referee, considered among the finest in world rugby, was amusing in his response to being flattened by Jimmy Cowan a few years ago. \u2018Try going past me next time,\u2019 he remarked, after eventually returning to his feet, even though he knew full well that he, and not the New Zealand scrum-half, was at fault. It was entertaining to listen to him this week as he reflected on a hugely impressive performance at Twickenham last Saturday. Welsh referee Nigel Owens disputes a decision with England captain Chris Robshaw at Twickenham . Television viewers were struck by the manner in which he handled the players during an extraordinary game that occasionally became bad-tempered. He defused certain situations quite beautifully, even addressing individuals by their full Christian names to exert some authority. Chris Robshaw became \u2018Christopher\u2019, with Owens praising the England skipper and his opposite number for playing some marvellous rugby while ordering them to cut out the nonsense. It worked \u2014 players addressed him as \u2018sir\u2019. Rugby players generally tend to respect referees rather more than their footballing counterparts but Owens, 43, commands more respect than most. Owens commands more respect than many referees when taking charge of top level rugby . When he was the victim of homophobic chanting at Twickenham last autumn, \u2014 two England fans were fined and banned for abusing Owens for being gay \u2014 he received messages of support from players from England as well as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, France and Wales. And when he once asked Ronan O\u2019Gara to sign a copy of his autobiography for his father, the then Ireland fly-half wished Geraint Owens a happy Christmas, but also added how proud he should be of his son. He will go up in the estimation of most for the way he handled a situation only this week. The victim of a homophobic tweet after last weekend\u2019s Six Nations encounter, Owens agreed to travel to Carmarthen Police Station to meet the 18-year-old who had abused him. As part of an agreed Adult Community Resolution \u2014 an alternative way of resolving crimes that allows victims to be involved in deciding how the offender can be dealt with by choosing from a list of out-of-court options \u2014 Owens accepted what he described as \u2018a profound apology\u2019 and let the matter rest. International referee Nigel Owens jokes around with wrestler Barri Griffiths on a Welsh TV show . Owens, who does some stand-up comedy in his spare time, appears to enjoy the limelight . \u2018It\u2019s like refereeing a game of rugby,\u2019 Owens told me. \u2018You can\u2019t referee in black and white. There is an awful lot of grey and you have to apply a bit of common sense. \u2018This young man was genuinely remorseful for something he accepts was stupid. He apologised to me publicly on Twitter and on Facebook. \u2018He could have been left with a criminal record but I saw no point in that on this occasion. The key thing is to get the message out there that it\u2019s not acceptable to insult someone in that way. \u2018I have learned to handle this kind of abuse. But there will be people out there who are struggling the way I once did and they will find it extremely hurtful. This is about protecting them.\u2019 Getting the key decisions right is how a referee is ultimately judged but players seem to like Owens\u2019 style. \u2018Until someone said it to me I hadn\u2019t realised I\u2019d called Robshaw \u201cChristopher\u201d,\u2019 he says. \u2018I suppose you could see it as a device that makes clear to someone you\u2019re not entirely happy with them. It might be the way a teacher addresses a pupil. I did work as a technician at a school for a number of years and also with kids in youth clubs. The 43-year-old directs England and France players during the feisty encounter at Twickenham last weekend . \u2018But I\u2019d probably address most people by their full name until I know them a bit better. \u2018I learned from Derek Bevan, a great referee, and I think the secret is to be authoritative, firm and fair but not over-officious. \u2018If you show the players respect they tend to respect you. And sometimes you can defuse a situation with a smile or a quick bit of wit. That\u2019s probably where comedy comes in handy. I\u2019ve been doing stand-up since I was 14.\u2019 Rugby is his first love, but Owens follows football too and he takes an interest in some of the issues currently concerning referees in the round-ball game. The crowding of referees is a particular concern, while there is growing pressure for video technology. Owens shakes hands with Robshaw after last Saturday's Six Nations clash at Twickenham . \u2018I certainly don\u2019t think you can officiate at the top level in rugby without the technology that helps you get the key decisions right,\u2019 he says. \u2018That\u2019s what we want to achieve across all sports. \u2018It\u2019s still not perfect. Even with a video replay, mistakes can still be made. But it\u2019s definitely something I believe football would benefit from. \u2018On occasions in rugby it is over-used and we have to guard against that. And football doesn\u2019t have the natural stoppages that make it a bit easier to call on video technology in rugby. Football has more of a natural flow. \u2018I think something like a captain\u2019s challenge would be interesting; say one challenge per half per team for the decisions that really matter.\u2019 The Welsh referee, who took charge of England vs France last weekend, has done stand-up since he was 14 . Respect is the other issue; one, in fairness to football, that the authorities have tried to tackle with different campaigns over the years. \u2018Only if you are very naive would you say football doesn\u2019t have an issue with respect,\u2019 says Owens. \u2018But rugby shouldn\u2019t take the moral high ground either because I\u2019ve seen problems in our sport too. I\u2019ve seen referees being pushed in grassroots games and so on. \u2018Ultimately it\u2019s a problem in society, although football has to recognise it can influence how young people behave in society. But I think the laws of rugby allow referees to deal with these kind of issues more effectively. There are more breaks in rugby that enable you to speak to the players. \u2018Referees could also be supported in terms of the citing process. If I make a mistake by giving a player a yellow card when it should have been red, it can be given retrospectively as a red. \u2018This doesn\u2019t happen in football, but if players knew that was a possibility \u2014 that the citing process was toughened up \u2014 it would lead to better behaviour on the field.\u2019", "reference": "43-year-old took charge of England vs France Six Nations clash .\nOwens defused certain situations quite brilliantly in bad-tempered match .\n'Sometimes you can defuse a situation with a smile or a quick bit of wit'"}, "56": {"id": "a50b5129839e6782c8c0cc6d9f6520f0371bcdbf", "article": "(CNN)The FBI is asking detectives across the country to dust off their cold case murder files and see whether millionaire heir Robert Durst could be connected to any other unsolved crimes. Durst, the focus of HBO's true crime documentary series \"The Jinx,\" was charged with first-degree murder last week in the 2000 killing of his longtime confidante, Susan Berman. Now the FBI is putting out a call to local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where Durst lived over the past five decades, a U.S. law enforcement official said. Unsolved cases in Vermont, upstate New York, the San Francisco Bay area and Southern California are among those getting a new look, the official said. Durst's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, said it's a sign that authorities are desperate. \"They seem to be going to such great lengths to pin something else on him,\" DeGuerin said. \"They must not have much of a case to begin with.\" Durst, who authorities believe has a net worth of $100 million, has lived in numerous places and owned property in at least four states, according to court documents and public records. In \"The Jinx,\" Durst describes the time he spent living in Vermont with his first wife, Kathleen, running a health food store in the 1970s. In 1982, Kathleen McCormack Durst went missing. Durst says he last saw her when he dropped her off at a train station in Katonah, New York, and she headed to their Manhattan apartment. Her family members say they believe she's dead and that Durst is the one to blame. The case has never been solved. He's also lived in Galveston, Texas, where he admitted to shooting a neighbor and dismembering the body in 2001. He was acquitted in a 2003 murder trial after arguing he'd acted in self-defense. Last week, police searched condos Durst owns in Houston as part of the investigation into Berman's death. She was shot dead in December 2000 in her Beverly Hills, California, home. Investigators know Durst was in California the week Berman died. It's a detail Durst shrugs off in the HBO documentary,  in which he denied he had anything to do with Berman's death and said, \"California's a big state.\" Authorities investigating a decades-old cold case in Vermont said Monday that there's a connection between Durst and the case of Lynne Schulze, a college student who disappeared from Middlebury College in 1971. \"We are aware of the connection between the disappearance of Lynne Schulze and Robert Durst,\" Middlebury Police Capt. Tom Hanley said. \"We have been aware of this connection for several years and have been working with various outside agencies as we follow this lead.\" Hanley elaborated Tuesday on the nature of the connection, saying Durst owned a health food store where Schulze shopped the day she disappeared. But there is no evidence the two had met, Hanley said. DeGuerin's attorney brushed off the accusation Monday. \"You know, he may have been in Chicago when Jimmy Hoffa disappeared,\" he said. \"He's an easy target.\" The name of the health food store, \"All Good Things,\" was also the title of a 2010 film starring Ryan Gosling and Kirsten Dunst that was a thinly veiled fictional take on the Durst case. After seeing the film, Durst reached out to director Andrew Jarecki and said he wanted to be interviewed. The interviews with Durst became the basis for \"The Jinx.\" Durst says in the documentary that he had traveled during the week of Berman's death to Trinidad, California, a small coastal city in northern California. \"It was very rural, very pretty,\" he says. And it was a place, Durst says, where he lived \"off and on.\" In Eureka, about 20 miles south, Durst has been part of another investigation. Authorities there say they haven't ruled out the possibility he could be connected to the disappearance of Karen Mitchell, who went missing in November 1997 when she was 16 years old. The police chief said investigators were interested in learning what Durst has to say about that case now that he's behind bars. \"We are certainly interested in any information that may or may not come out of interviews with Mr. Durst,\" Police Chief Andy Mills said. \"If information comes to us that allows us to further our investigation, then we will certainly take the opportunity to do that.\" According to local news reports at the time of Mitchell's disappearance, she was last seen leaning into a light blue car that she might have gotten into. A witness gave police a description of the man behind the wheel, which resulted in a sketch of a gray-haired man with glasses -- a drawing that journalist Matt Birkbeck says looks remarkably like Durst. \"He wears these wide-rim glasses. He was wearing those glasses back in the day and it's also in the composite,\" said Birkbeck, whose book, \"A Deadly Secret,\" chronicles Durst's life and run-ins with the law. \"Durst apparently knew Karen Mitchell. Karen had volunteered at a homeless shelter in Eureka, which Durst had frequented, which he had a habit of doing in different cities,\" Birkbeck said. He'd also gone to a shoe store that Mitchell's aunt ran at a mall in Eureka, Birkbeck said. The former lead investigator on the case,  Dave Parris, retired several years ago and could not be reached for comment. In 2003, he told The Journal News that there were similarities between Durst and the composite sketch. \"He's a lead we're following,\" Parris told the newspaper, \"and with all the information we've learned about him, I'm not fully comfortable that I can eliminate him from our investigation at this point.\" Investigators looking at other cases across the country have their work cut out for them, Birkbeck said. \"In 2002, when my book was first published, we reported that police found six addresses in the San Francisco Bay area alone. Some of them were properties, some of them were post offices, some of them were warehouse facilities. There were other address in Northern California, Southern California, as well as other parts of the country,\" he told CNN's \"Erin Burnett: Outfront.\" But the investigation is nothing new, he said. \"They've been looking at this for several years now,\" he said. \"I guess with recent events, they've really expanded their scope.\" CNN's Jean Casarez contributed to this report.", "reference": "Police say Robert Durst owned a store in Vermont at time college student disappeared .\nFBI asks local authorities to examine cold cases in areas where Robert Durst has lived .\nMillionaire heir's attorney says it's a sign investigators \"must not have much of a case\""}, "57": {"id": "97c80fc1eca236bb19a8c7a20963067f06b36000", "article": "A real-life Paddington bear who suffered such brutal treatment in a circus that she lost her claws, teeth and most of her fur is looking for a new home \u2013 with the support of the creator of her marmalade-loving fictional relative.

These pictures show the stunning one-of-a-kind Land Rover Defender produced by Sir Paul, who has been a fan of the 4x4 for years and owns several of them. The bodywork features 27 different coloured panels based on British woodlands and colours used by the British Army, while the interior is covered with bespoke leather and fabrics made by Sir Paul. Striking: Designed Sir Paul Smith custom made this one-of-a-kind Land Rover Defender to celebrate the iconic car ahead of it going out of production at the end of the year . Patchwork: The body panels are painted a total of 27 different colours, and Sir Paul said he took inspiration from the countryside and British Army vehicles for the design . Historic: The modern-day Defender is a descendant of the first ever car made by Land Rover, the Series 1, and has been in production since 1948 . The designer, who was knighted in 2000 and has dressed the likes of Bradley Wiggins and the England football team, said: 'The Defender is a British icon, which is something I\u2019m exceptionally proud of. 'This is a complete one-off; I wanted to give this Defender a feeling of luxury, so I used a mix of leather and fabric for the seats. 'I actually used the fabric that I design for Maharam, the American upholstery company. 'I wanted deep, rich colours, but at the same time, I wanted them to work together yet be surprising. My designs are known for their attention to detail, so I didn't want this Defender to be any different.' Luxurious: Sir Paul chose bespoke leather for the interior, and had the seats made out of fabric he disgnes himself for an American fashion-house . Pedigree: Since 1948 around 15.million Defenders have been produced, and it is thought that as many as two thirds of those are still on the road somewhere in the world . Detailing: The London designer, who was knighted in 2000 and has dressed the likes of Bradley Wiggins and the England football team, said attention to detail was key in making the Defender . Included on the car are two Paul Smith logos. One inside a clock on the dashboard, and another below the Land Rover logo on the back. The modern-day defender is a descendant of Land Rover's first ever off-road vehicle, which was launched back in 1948, making it the world's oldest car still to be in production. Named the Series 1, the original design was sketched in sand on Anglesey beach by Rover's chief engineer Maurice Wilkes. Popular: Sir Paul called the car 'a British icon' and is known to be a fan, having owned several of them . Hand delivered: The Defender is seen parked outside the Paul Smith store in London's upmarket Mayfair . Since then Land Rover has sold 1.5million of the vehicles, and, of those, it is said that two thirds of them remain on the roads somewhere in the world. According to the Birmingham Mail, the Solihull factory that produces the Defender has had to ramp up production by 50 per cent to cope with orders flooding in before it is discontinued in December.

The same facility treated US nurse Nina Pham, who was infected with Ebola while caring for Liberian patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, at a Texas hospital. Mr Duncan later died from the virus. Ms Pham, 26, and another nurse, Amber Vinson, who was also infected have since recovered. On Friday, the CDC sent a team to Sierra Leone to investigate how the latest healthcare worker became exposed to Ebola, and determine who may have been in contact with the infected person. CDC spokesman Benjamin Haynes said the center was working out a plan with the U.S. State Department to determine who was coming back and where they will be sent on their return.

Four others are being sent to Nebraska Medical Center to be near their special isolation unit in case they develop Ebola symptoms.

Ireland entertain the unbeaten Poles at the Aviva Stadium desperate to bounce back from November's 1-0 defeat in Scotland, their first reverse of the campaign to date. With world champions Germany still favourites to finish top of the pile despite a less than auspicious start, the race for the second automatic qualification spot is well and truly on. Veteran keeper Shay Given hopes the Republic of Ireland can surprise leaders Poland on Sunday . Republic of Ireland goalkeepers David Forde and Shay Given during the training session at Gannon Park .

'Stephen has just had a little bit of difficulty. He's had an injury which he is coming back from and he's getting looked at this evening, with the club's permission, and we might have to do something about that. He's hoping maybe two or three days on that he's okay. 'Jon is coming in and he's pretty upbeat.

Turns out some women fake it in order to make it a real orgasm happen. Researchers surveyed 481 heterosexual females, all sexually active but not in serious relationships. Scroll down for video . The most common reason is faking an orgasm is to protect a man's feelings, says sexpert Tracey Cox . The results, published in The Journal of Sexual Archives, threw up the usual, predictable reasons for faking - but also a surprising one. The women gave four main reasons for faking orgasm. The most common reason was \u2018altruistic deceit\u2019 - to protect the man\u2019s feelings. Second, fear and insecurity. Wanting the sex to be a positive experience, rather than a negative one. Fourth, was faking it to end the sex session. No surprises there (though it\u2019s usually further up the list!) The most interesting reason came third on the list. \u2018Elevated arousal\u2019 - faking orgasm to make yourself feel more turned on. The women said by pretending to orgasm, they were attempting to increase their arousal levels. And do you know what? I believe them. The \u2018fake it till you make it\u2019 theory is based on the assumption that if you act out the thing you want to happen, sometimes it will. Psychologists use the same technique on depressed patients: the act of smiling triggers hormones which make us feel happier so a forced smile eventually turns into a real one. Sexpert Tracey Cox says for some women pretending to climax could actually bring on the real thing . The women in the study said if they pretended to orgasm, their partner got more excited, which got them more excited. By reenacting the lead-up to a real orgasm - breathing faster, making noise, moving your hips, tensing your muscles - you might just push yourself over the threshold to the point where orgasm becomes involuntary. But there are two crucial points that need to be made here. First up, the study was based on women who weren\u2019t in relationships so the overall percentage of \u2018fakers\u2019 (80 per cent) is hopefully lower in couples who are more comfortable with each other. It\u2019s also best not to use the \u2018fake it to make it\u2019 technique at the beginning of relationships (unless you explain that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing, which is unlikely). How is your partner ever going to learn to give you a real orgasm if they think they\u2019re doing it already? The absolute worst time to fake an orgasm is at the start of a relationship, which is, of course, when most women (and some men) do it. Keep on doing it and you\u2019ve set up a pattern of behaviour that\u2019s based on deception and dissatisfaction. He\u2019ll keep on using the same ineffectual techniques because he thinks he\u2019s turning you on; you\u2019ll remain frustrated and irritable every time you have sex. Having the courage to say \u201cActually, that does nothing for me,\u201d isn\u2019t easy but you really must. Communication is the key to good sex - and faking orgasm (for reasons that aren\u2019t so helpful) isn\u2019t necessary if admitting to not having one isn\u2019t a problem!

The historic landmark reached last year means just one mother in four stays at home to raise children. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed 74.1 per cent of mothers with children under 16, or between 16 and 18 if they are still at school, are regarded as \u2018participating in the labour market\u2019. By comparison, 75 per cent of women without dependent children were either in work or looking for a job last year. Mothers are now as likely to go out to work as women without children, figures showed yesterday . In the mid-1990s, only two thirds of mothers had jobs, while then, as now, three in four childless women were working. The gap has closed because there are now half a million more women with children under five in work, or looking for jobs, than in 1996. There are also 200,000 more women with children aged between five and ten in the labour market. Mothers were briefly more likely to have jobs than women without families in 2013, the ONS report revealed, but last year more than 350,000 childless women entered the growing labour market. The latest figures will be welcomed by Coalition ministers. Chancellor George Osborne said in his Budget speech on Wednesday that a key element of the Government\u2019s \u2018massive moment\u2019 in job creation, giving Britain its highest-ever employment rate, was \u2018more women in work than ever before\u2019. Ministers have claimed credit for raising state subsidies for childcare from \u00a32billion to \u00a33billion a year since 2010. But critics of the Government\u2019s drive for more mothers to go out to work say many are reluctant to do so and would prefer to stay at home to bring up their children. The historic landmark reached last year means just one mother in four stays at home to raise children (picture posed by models) Author and family commentator Jill Kirby said the figures were a result of government efforts to persuade mothers that \u2018children are better off in childcare\u2019, adding: \u2018Children are losing out \u2013 a string of different childcare workers is no substitute for the love of a mother.\u2019 Imogen Thompson, of the pressure group Mothers at Home Matter, said: \u2018We question whether this is what all women want, or whether many are forced into returning to the labour market before they feel they, or their children, are ready.\u2019 The new estimates are based on the large-scale Labour Force Survey covering women who either have jobs or are unemployed and looking for work. The ONS report said benefit changes that have pressed single parents into looking for work may have influenced the change. It added: \u2018Other government policies, for example to fund 570 hours of free early education childcare a year in England for all three to four-year-olds, will have provided additional incentives to engage with the labour market.\u2019 The biggest change has been among mothers of children under five. In 1996, 1.6million of them were in the labour market, compared with 2.1million last year. This represents a rise from 54.5 per cent of mothers of under-fives in work in 1996 to 65 per cent now. More mothers of older children are also working, but the rise has been much less steep, while the rates for women without dependents have not changed in nearly 20 years.

Joseph Defillipo from Scandinavian Middle School in Fresno, California, was recorded by a student's cellphone, saying: 'I just don't like the black kids.' Defillipo had been in the middle of a discussion with several students about who he didn't like at the school. The 20-second clip cuts off after the teacher's racially-insensitive comment. The vice principal has taught in the district for 18 years and has been at the middle school since 2010. The video was posted to YouTube on Friday where it has been watched more than 4,000 times. It was brought to the school's attention by a parent of the student involved. Scandinavian Middle School refused to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Online on Wednesday. Daily Mail Online was also waiting on a comment from the school district. In a statement to Daily Mail Online on Wednesday\u00a0the school said Defillipo had been put on paid administrative leave while an third-party, external investigation took place. A school statement read: 'Fresno Unified takes great pride in providing a positive learning environment for all students and staff. The interaction between the Scandinavian student and our employee has been brought to our attention and we are conducting an investigation. 'Fresno Unified takes this matter very seriously and we will take any necessary actions pending the results. During our investigation, and as a matter of practice, the employee is on paid administrative leave.' Several parents whose children attend Scandinavian Middle School told The Fresno Bee\u00a0that they want Defillipo\u00a0fired. A group of former students gathered outside the school premises on Tuesday to protest, chanting: 'I love black people' and 'black power'. Around 10 per cent of students at Scandinavian Middle School are black, The Fresno Bee reported. The vice principal earns around $87,000 a year, according to public records. The YouTube video attracted a number of comments, both attacking and in defense of the senior teacher. One commenter, Kevin Hill, wrote: 'I'd withhold any judgment until the rest of the video comes out. First, he was talking to black mids [sic], most likely joking, inappropriate, yeah but not racist.

Governors of the Judd School in Tonbridge, Kent, admitted failing to ensure the safety of a 14 year-old boy who nearly died from head injuries after being hit with a metal shot. But less than a week after the case was heard by magistrates,\u00a0paramedics returned to the school when a 12 year-old pupil reportedly ran into a wall following a 100 metre sprint. The Judd School was fined \u00a310,000 last week after a 14-year-old pupil was hit in the head during a shot put event when too many sports were going on at the same time. Last week the school had to call an ambulance after another pupil is believed to have been injured after running into a wall during a 100m sprint event . The year eight pupil had to be treated at the scene and then taken to hospital after being injured after he ran into a wall at the prestigious school at about 1pm last Friday, headmaster Robert Masters confirmed. The boy suffered a bang to his forehead and was taken to Pembury Hospital in Tunbridge Wells, a South East Coast Ambulance spokesman said. He is no longer in hospital. Days earlier Sevenoaks Magistrates' Court heard the school failed to follow its own safety guidelines during a PE lesson last June where a pupil, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was hit on the back of the skull during a shot put event. Pupils were taking part in six field sports on June 20 last year. The lesson included discus, triple jump, long jump, javelin, hurdles and the shot put. But health and safety guidelines say the 1,000-pupil school should have had a maximum of four sports, with just one throwing event, going on at the same time. After he was injured the year nine pupil was rushed to King's College Hospital in London for emergency brain surgery because parts of his skull had gone into his brain, causing swelling. He was in hospital for almost a month. A pupil was hit on the head by a shot during an athletics session on the shot put field (pictured) last year . Magistrates heard the boy had returned to the school but will have to live with 'the consequences' of the incident for the rest of his life. He was formerly a keen rugby player but has been told he will never play again. The school was charged with breaching their general duty to the pupil and pleaded guilty. Magistrates said\u00a0the safety breach was 'substantial' and ordered the the school to pay \u00a310,000 in fines and \u00a31,375 in costs. The court heard that the boy had been part of the triple jump group and was returning to the centre of the field as the teacher whistled to signal the end of the lesson.\u00a0But the pupil who threw the shot says he didn't hear the whistle. The Judd School was fined \u00a310,000 over the incident involving the shot put, after magistrates ruled they had breached their general duty to the pupil . He started the throw with his back to the landing area the victim was stood beside, and it hit him on the head. Following the incident the school said it had\u00a0suspended their athletics lessons until a full audit was done and revised health and safety measures had been put in place. Speaking after the ruling head teacher Robert Masters said they expressed 'deepest regret' over the incident. He previously said:\u00a0'We have re-examined all our safety procedures in PE and are in the process of doing the same across the whole school. We have also shared the lessons from this incident with other secondary schools.

London-based social media analyst Tim Grimes tweeted: 'Based on 2014 iTunes Revenue: Apple are losing $34,246 per minute, $2,054,794 per hour the #iTunes store is down.' Seeing as the outage encompassed other services, it could follow that Apple's losses were much higher than this. Tim Cook has previously said that the App Store posted $4.6 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2014, which means that firm could have lost around $2 million an hour, or almost $35,000 a minute. Based on those figures, yesterday's technical problem could have cost the company in the region of $48 million. Yesterday, one person tweeted: 'If iTunes doesn't start working within the next two hours I will literally cry...' A user called MisterDanD said: '\u00a0iTunes, App Store is DOWN worldwide, which is screwing up my morning! has someone hacked them? #apple #iTunes' and a user called lightcap wrote: 'Apple's app store is down (for purchasing, not browsing), but the world's most useless site remains useless as ever...' posting a link to the company's status page.

McCall replaces Kenny McDowall with the remit to get the Ibrox club, rejuvenated off the field following Dave King\u2019s successful ousting of the previous board, out of the Championship. And, while he is urging the dozen out-of-contract players at Rangers to concentrate on winning new deals, he made it very clear that he\u2019d like to stay on beyond the summer. New Rangers manager Stuart McCall raises the club scarf after being unveiled on Thursday afternoon . The former Motherwell boss said: \u2018Yes. Regarding the players playing for their futures and new contracts, I\u2019m in the same boat. \u2018We\u2019re here for the short term, we know that. But we\u2019ve got an opportunity to put down a marker. If we can do well, who knows what will happen in the future? \u2018I\u2019ve enjoyed being back on the training ground. It\u2019s a big, big challenge. Anyone who has seen the side over the last three or four months will know that. But it\u2019s a massive opportunity, privilege and honour.

But look at quality of squad. They know we\u2019ve underperformed. There is enough quality in there to do better. \u2018Football can change so quickly. There is no magic pill for confidence, which has severely lacking. But sometimes a new voice can provide a spark. \u2018Their main aim should be turning things around. There are 12 boys out of contract, go win yourself a contract. McDowall was a reluctant leader at Rangers and was boss for 10 games, winning just three of those . \u2018Be there at end of season, going around a full Ibrox to cheers, rather than hurrying down tunnel being booed off.\u2019 McCall spoke to McDowall on Thursday and intends to make contact with former team-mate Ally McCoist, still technically on gardening leave from Rangers. His reign began with hard work on Wednesday, calling the players in on their day off to go through an afternoon training session, explaining: \u2018Our aim is to get out of the league. The quicker we could get down to it, better. Stuart McCall (left), who was Scotland assistant under Gordon Strachan, has taken charge at Ibrox . \u2018They got a group text at half eleven to come in for half two, which would have been tricky for some of them.

I\u2019ve always said it\u2019s important to have Rangers people on the board. \u2018You don\u2019t need someone Ranger-minded as manager. But somebody who knows the league, knows players, knows Scottish football was probably right choice. \u2018In an ideal world, you would want to come in to a club in pre-season.

Spanish journalist Marc Marginedas, 46, who was released a year ago, says he and 18 other hostages were guarded by three terrorists, who all spoke with British accents. And he reveals that they named them the 'Beatles' because they liked 'beating' people, not simply because they were British. The leader of the group, who came to be known as Jihadi John and has since been identified as Kuwaiti-born Londoner Mohammed Emwazi, went on to behead five hostages. Telling his story: Spanish journalist Marc Marginedas, 46, who was released by ISIS a year ago, says he and 18 other hostages were guarded by three terrorists, who all spoke with British accents . Killer: The leader of the so-called 'Beatles' - who came to be known as Jihadi John (left) and has since been identified as Kuwaiti-born Londoner Mohammed Emwazi (right) - \u00a0went on to behead five hostages . Mr Marginedas, a seasoned war reporter held for six months by ISIS, has published a detailed account of his ordeal at the hands of the 'Beatles' in the Spanish newspaper, El Peri\u00f3dico de Catalunya. The hostages were eventually taken to a prison in Raqqa, northern Syria, where the 'Beatles' had a room next to the prisoners, separated only by a broken glass door and a curtain. Mr Marginedas said the three masked 'Beatles' liked to burst into their cell shouting and threatening the prisoners, and always ended up 'beating' at least one of the hostages. Prisoner: Marc Marginedas, a seasoned war reporter - was held for six months by Islamic State terrorists . On one occasion he recalls how Jihadi John carried out a savage beating of one of the hostages who had been told to approach the door. Recalls Mr Marginedas: 'Once in position, [Jihadi John] took a red pen and began to draw a sword on the [unnamed] hostage's face, letting him know, in this macabre he would end his days in Syria, beheaded.' 'The pen tip broke before he finished the sketch, but Jihadi John wanted to finish his work with the rest of sharpened pencil, already cut almost like a knife, tearing the skin of the cheek with a vengeance, and leaving for the following days a visible wound in the face, outlined by the scar.' Mr Marginedas also claims that the Beatles were only put in charge of the prisoners because Islamic State commanders couldn't spare hardened fighters from the battlefield. And he believes this may have been a source of a grievance to them which only served to fuel their cruelty. Mr Marginedas was captured on the 4th of September 2013 by rebel jihadists, close to the city of Hama, in Western Syria. He had entered the country three days before, through Turkey; accompanied by members of the Free Syrian Army (FSA). According to Mr Marginedas, Jihadi John was a 'manic-depressive', similar to that of a serial killer so often depicted in films. Ill-treated: Marc Marginedas said the three masked 'Beatles' liked to burst into their cell shouting and threatening the prisoners, and always ended up 'beating' at least one of the hostages . His first victim: American journalist James Foley was the first Western citizen to have been killed on film by Jihadi John in a sickening propaganda video . Another Spanish journalist, released shortly after Mr Marginedas, has told how the prisoners had to wear orange jumpsuits and had to memorise in Arabic a number written on their back. Writing in the Sunday Times, Javier Espinosa, described how Emwazi squeezed maximum drama out of the torture and intimidation of the hostages. Espinosa, a journalist for Spanish newspaper El Mundo, said Emwazi liked to carry an antique metre-long sword with a silver handle, of the kind Muslim armies used in the Middle Ages. After enduring a mock execution at the hands of Jihadi John, Mr Espinosa said 'that encounter confirmed the psychopathic character of my interlocutors.' Emwazi was among 'psychotic' extremists who pillaged the Spaniard's belongings to put towards a haul of stolen cash apparently so large there were rooms filled with millions of dollars. It was, he continued, one of 'several episodes of psychological and physical torture, privations and humiliations' prisoners endured. Slaughtered: Britons Alan Henning (left) and David Haines (right) are among the hostages who were savagely murdered by Jihadi John . Sick: James Foley (left) became the first Westerner to be murdered by the terror group's British executioner in chief Mohammed Emwazi, also known as 'Jihadi John', (right) in a shocking filmed beheading last August . Mr Espinosa was snatched with his colleague photographer Ricardo Garcia Vilanova when the pair were working near the Turkish border in 2013. Alongside American journalists and aid workers including Britons Alan Henning and David Haines, they were locked in ISIS prisons - as Mr Espinosa describes them as 'elegant mansions' and the former government headquarters in Raqqa - across the war-ravaged country for months. Being woken by the screams of other hostages as they were tortured in their cells was commonplace. On one occasion, the Spaniard notes, a young boy was beaten to a pulp after being caught smoking - a forbidden habit under oppressive Sharia law. The European and American hostages who disappeared had been either freed or moved, Mr Espinosa claims to have been told. Instead they were being picked off one by own, their deaths showcased to the world in barbaric propaganda videos. Story: Pictured right is Javier Espinosa, a Spanish journalist who was held along with his colleague Ricardo Garcia Vilanova (left) by ISIS between December 2013 and March last year. Espinosa, described how Emwazi squeezed maximum drama out of the torture and intimidation of the hostages . Freed: The moment journalist Javier Espinosa was reunited with his son on the tarmac of a Spanish airport after spending months in captivity, held by ISIS terrorists . Mr Marginedas recounts an incident in February last year when Jihadi John visited the hostages and claimed that he had been wounded in combat: 'Once, on a February evening, he appeared in the room and began walking in circles to the silent hostages.\u00a0He seemed limp, and claimed that he had been wounded in combat during the day. 'He said \"I wonder what you would do to me if you were in my position,\" hinting that he was aware of the suffering being imposed on innocent and the desire for revenge that may be raising his performance.' Mr Marginedas says the jihadists' evil cruelty is further demonstrated by another episode in which the 'Beatles' gave the leftovers of their food to half the starving hostages while the remaining hostages were ordered to watch their fellow prisoners eating. This, he says, was designed to sow bad feeling among the prisoners - which it did, with recriminations against those who had played the Beatles' game by eating the food. Mr Marginedas was one of the first of the 19 hostages from 11 different countries to be released by IS. He recalls how Jihadi John first told him the good news: 'Marcos, Marcos [is the name on my passport], are you ready to go? ' , he asked in a quiet, mellow voice. \"Yeah, I replied, instinctively looked up by the surprise news that was giving me and forgetting that when we spoke to the 'Beatles' I had to keep my eyes focused on the ground, fearing that we might end up identifying these three masked by eye.

I saw them every day for a month as they grappled with confusion and mixed messages from Malaysia Airlines and the Malaysian government. I was there when many received text messages saying \"none of those on board survived.\" Many had to be wheeled out on gurneys. Some lashed out at the cameras. The news cycle moved on but the families are still here. They are still in pain. And all the family members I speak to say their loved ones are alive. They never speak in the past tense, they cling onto each theory that is circulated and they refuse to sign any documents to start financial settlements. \"I think psychologically it is understandable, they choose to believe that their loved ones are still missing, so they can still have hope for them to return,\" says May Lam, a psychiatrist at The University of Hong Kong. She says the families need constant support from social workers and the government and they need to be helped to gradually accept their loss. But many say they are treated like an inconvenience.

Queues of up to five miles and lengthy delays are predicted when the new regime starts on April 8. Under the new rules, the passport of every passenger in a car or coach will have to be individually scanned. Ministers insist that knowing who is leaving the country is vital for counting the number of immigrants in Britain and fighting crime and terrorism. Nightmare journeys:\u00a0P&O Ferries has claimed new border control rules will cause huge delays leaving the country with\u00a0'coachloads of little old ladies  bearing the brunt' But even though no checks have taken place over the past 17 years, the Home Office decided the best date to reinstate them should be on the second week in April \u2013 when vast numbers of Britons head to the continent during the Easter school break. Ferry companies warn that holidaymakers will be held in queues on the A20 in Kent, blocking the route between Dover and Folkestone during one of the busiest times of year. MPs on the home affairs select committee were sent a letter from the UK Chamber of Shipping claiming trials had shown that queues of at least 650 vehicles would form on busy days. Tim Reardon, the chamber\u2019s policy director, said: \u2018The model showed that, with tourist and freight check-in transactions extended by exit checks, the queue of traffic heading for the port of Dover would extend at least 8km, blocking the A20 almost as far as Folkestone.\u2019 Eurotunnel calculates the new system will quadruple the time taken to get vehicles onto shuttle trains. Buses with 30 or more passengers on board will take even longer. Checking a car on to a cross-Channel train takes 15 seconds at the moment. But passport checks on up to five passengers will stretch that closer to two minutes, adding to delays. Eurotunnel public affairs director John Keefe said: \u2018You only have to multiply the number of people in each vehicle \u2013 five six or seven in a car or 30 or more in a coach \u2013 to see how this will play out. Protective measures:\u00a0The checks start on April 8 and Eurotunnel and ferry companies will be checking the passports of all those leaving the country to tighten national security . \u2018That increases the risk of congestion and delays. That\u2019s the risk we are trying to mitigate. But the risks are significant.\u2019 Advice: Immigration Minister James Brokenshire told the Today programme that people should set out on their journeys earlier to avoid delays . Ministers were last night under pressure from MPs to make exceptions to the rules, such as large coach parties. Interviewed on BBC Radio Four\u2019s Today programme yesterday, immigration minister James Brokenshire twice hesitated before saying passengers should set out early on their journeys. Quizzed a third time, he said: \u2018On busy days I think it is advisable for anyone to set out earlier to ensure that they are at their ports of departure on time.\u2019 He denied there would be chaos, insisting: \u2018There are often queues at both Eurotunnel and also Dover in terms of their day-to-day operations.\u2019 In the event of huge queues, managers on the ground will not have the authority to relax the checks. They would have to seek personal approval from a minister or government official. Transport bosses say the April 8 deadline has been imposed for political reasons so ministers can say they have exit checks in place before the general election. The original date they had in mind was April 1 \u2013 just two days before Good Friday \u2013 but implementation was delayed by a week when the Home Office was warned the consequences would be even worse. Despite the inconvenience caused by the checks, the Home Office will still not have a full picture of who is in the country. The checks do not apply to journeys to Ireland or travel by private aircraft or boats. Airports are not likely to be hit by the checks.

The video comes just one day after ISIS released gruesome footage of the murder of a man the terror group accused of working as a spy. The video was filmed in  Aleppo and shows a man believed to be named\u00a0Ahmed Muhammad being led out to a forecourt by masked executioners, who then shoot him in the head multiple times at point blank range. In a chilling sign of ISIS' reach and influence,\u00a0Muhammad is understood to have been accused of working as part of a secret spy network based  in neighbouring NATO member state Turkey before his brutal filmed execution\u00a0over the border in Syria. Titled 'A Lesson To Be Learned', the three minute 40 second video has all the hallmarks of an official ISIS release - employing HD cameras, Hollywood-style sound and visual effects and slick editing and direction. It also carries the logo of one of the group's official Aleppo-based propaganda arms, Halab. The Islamic State cherry picks sections of the Koran and misinterprets the accounts of the Prophet Muhammad in order to wage jihad and sign up new recruits, experts say. It is estimated that 20,000 people have streamed into the territory in Iraq and Syria, where ISIS has proclaimed what it calls a 'caliphate', ruled by its often brutal version of Islamic law. The group purport to recreate the conquests and rule of the Prophet Muhammad and his successors and maintains its worst brutalities - such as beheading captives - only prove its purity in following what it contends is the prophet's example. But now Muslims clerics and other experts are speaking out, saying that the group hand picks what it wants from Islam's holy book, the Koran, and from accounts of Muhammad's actions and sayings, known as the Hadith. An ISIS member parades through the streets of Raqqa in Syria waving an Islamic State flag and brandishing a gun. Experts have now said that ISIS misinterprets the Koran in order to wage jihad . It then misinterprets many of these, while ignoring everything in the texts that contradicts those hand-picked selections. Writings by the group's clerics and its English-language online magazine, Dabiq, are full of citations from Koranic verses, the Hadith and centuries of interpreters, mostly from hardliners. But Joas Wagemakers, an assistant professor of Islamic Studies at Radboud University in the Netherlands, says these are taken far out of context by ISIS. He explained that Muslim scholars throughout history have used texts in a 'decontextualised way' to suit their purposes and says that ISIS represent the extreme. He added: 'It would be a mistake to conclude the Islamic State group's extremism is the true Islam that emerges from the Koran and Hadith.", "reference": "Victim is dragged before bloodthirsty onlookers in the Syrian city of Raqqa .\nBearded cleric tells the crowd that he has been found guilty of stealing .\nMan is pinned down in a chair while a group of jihadis hold him in place .\nThey then use a large meat cleaver to brutally sever his hand from his arm .\nAnother image shows ISIS surgeon tending to the man's gruesome wounds ."}, "87": {"id": "1b97eed1820cfe1fcfb761504c507a102577bd67", "article": "While having a baby is a joyous time for families, nine months of pregnancy followed by the sleepless nights, the challenges of breast feeding and hormonal changes have their own effect on new mums.

Post-natal hair loss is an issue for many new mothers. This is because pregnancy hormones stop womens\u2019 usual daily hair-shedding, giving the appearance of extra-thick hair. But once the hormones return to normal about three to six months after birth, the extra hair finally falls out. Although many mums fear they're going bald, in fact their hair is returning to normal in a process that can take up to a year. Kate Hudson noticed her hair was thinning after having both her children Ryder, aged 11, and Bingham, now three. She told Redbook magazine in 2012: \u2018When I had [first son] Ryder, I was 24 and didn\u2019t really experience any changes to my hair or skin.

While 'waist training' by wearing a structured corset for several hours a day to cinch in your waist has recently become a celebrity craze, Jessica Alba swore by a similar practice after giving birth to her two daughters Honor, seven, and Haven, four. It's thought that compression from the girdle helps the uterus to return to normal size. Also, during pregnancy the muscle that runs down the centre of the stomach separates and it's thought that the corsets can help push them back together again more quickly. The Fantastic Four star said: 'I wore a double corset day and night for three months. It was brutal; it\u2019s not for everyone. It was sweaty, but worth it.'

It's not as easy when it comes to health care. The truth is that undergoing a simple tonsillectomy can cost as little as $4,000 to as much as $14,000, depending on the city, according to new data compiled by Gawker. Using data from\u00a0HealthSparq, the website charted eight common procedures and compared how much they cost in Washington, DC; New York City; Miami; Houston; Los Angeles and San Francisco. Random: New data shows the difference in price for common health care procedures in six cities across the U.S. Above, the cost of undergoing a tonsillectomy varies as much as $10,000 . Common procedure: The cost of undergoing an appendectomy hovers around $14,000 in most cities, but is a steal in Washington DC at $9,000 . The results will certainly have Houston residents driving to Los Angeles if they want to undergo a carpal tunnel procedure. A carpal tunnel release procedure at a surgical center in Houston costs upwards of $20,000 - while the price of the same procedure in the other cities hover between $5,000 and $8,000. Herniated disc decompression surgery costs $15,000 in Washington and more than three and a half times more in Houston and Los Angeles - more than $48,000. A simply tonsillectomy will run $3,500 in Washington - but costs $14,000 in San Francisco. The reason health care costs are not widely advertised stems from the fact that they vary based on who ends up paying - and insurers don't like revealing the negotiated final amount. However, there has been a recent push towards price transparency. Some states have  started making databses of health care costs based on insurance claims and other insurance data. You can also research the costs of health care further on websites like HealthcareBlueBook.com.

It will require his best win as City boss against Barca at the Nou Camp on Wednesday for Pellegrini to save the club\u2019s Champions League dream and, possibly, his job. But City set out for Spain on Monday on the back of a dismal defeat at Turf Moor and a withering assessment of their shortcomings from Burnley\u2019s match-winner George Boyd. George Boyd celebrates his sweet strike that saw Burnley upset Manchester City on Saturday . Burnley's Ben Mee tackles Pablo Zabaleta with the kind of physical presence he says helped them win . The Scot accused the Premier League champions of lacking both the appetite for a physical battle and willingness to track back and defend. It was something Burnley detected when they recovered to draw 2-2 at the Etihad in December and exploited again after analysing City\u2019s defeat at Anfield earlier this month. \u2018You saw it recently against Liverpool, they don\u2019t track back as well as they go forward so we knew we could exploit that and we did,\u2019 said Boyd, who scored with the sweetest of strikes after an hour. \u2018I think it was playing to our strengths and getting in their faces that got us the win. You find with the bigger teams if you get in amongst them, press them hard and tackle they don\u2019t really like it, and we did that. \u2018I don\u2019t think Barcelona will be in their faces as much as us and playing the long balls we play, but I thought we fully deserved the victory. \u2018We didn\u2019t think they would play as strong a team with Wednesday in mind, but obviously they came here to win and we were better than them.\u2019 Boyd drills home his left-footed shot for the famous win against a side that goes to Barcelona on Wednesday . City boss Manuel Pellegrini is under pressure although his future will be decided at the close of the season . It is not the first time City\u2019s work ethic has been questioned this season, but there appeared to be a deeper malaise. It was as bad as anything in the post-title slump under Roberto Mancini. They were flat, dull and at times almost uninterested. Everything that Burnley weren\u2019t. Sportsmail\u2019s Jamie Redknapp said it was the kind of performance that gets a manager the sack. No wonder Pellegrini\u2019s agent was touting him to Napoli last week. There won\u2019t be any knee-jerk reactions from City, however, Pellegrini\u2019s performance will be assessed at the end of the season. City prepare to kick off after conceding the first goal at Turf Moor that they were unable to peg back . Edin Dzeko's attempt on goal is blocked by some desperate Burnley defence . The Chilean could yet mastermind a recovery in Barcelona and take City into the quarter-finals of the Champions League for the first time, having emerged from the first leg only 2-1 down. But apart from Samir Nasri and Aleksandar Kolarov this was close to the team that Pellegrini is expected to put out at the Nou Camp and they lost to a side battling relegation. Instead of making up ground on Chelsea in the title race, City are now in danger of getting swallowed up in the chase for places in next season\u2019s Champions League and that would test the patience of Pellegrini\u2019s employers. He maintains that the situation is not as bad as the corresponding period last season when City went out of the FA Cup and Champions League in the space of four days, losing at home to Wigan and away to Barcelona. The 61-year-old said: \u2018It\u2019s always the case before a big game that maybe the minds are not completely on this game,\u2019 he said. \u2018But I don\u2019t think it was a case of them not trying. I don\u2019t think Burnley had any chances to score apart from the free-kick which led to the beautiful goal. \u2018Of course we are not doing well. You can see that from the amount of points we have dropped. The only thing I can tell you is that it\u2019s not down to the effort of the players.

Scroll down for videos . The S.S. Maria Theresa's grand lobby features an enormous oil painting of the\u00a0Habsburg dynasty's only female ruler . Designed by the Red Carnation Hotel Collection, the S.S. Maria Theresa boasts 64 staterooms and 11 suites, including the 410-square foot royal suite. Its smallest staterooms are just over 160 square feet. Guests will enjoy extravagant amenities on board the 443ft vessel, as all of the Baroque-inspired ship's luxury accommodations have fabric wall coverings, plush carpets, antique furnishings and original art. Canopy or four-poster  Savoir beds are another lavish touch, while open-air French balconies on the main and upper decks offer panoramic water views. The grand lobby features a 10-ft oil painting of Maria Theresa, whose 40-year reign ended with her death in 1780. When they\u2019re not in their rooms or above deck passengers can unwind in full-service bars, a restaurant or cinema. The riverboat also has a heated swimming pool, spa, and coffee bar, and guests are treated to in-room butler services. Princess Anita von Hohenberg, a direct descendant of the Habsburg dynasty, will be on hand for the christening of the vessel. Her father,\u00a0Franz Ferdinand, Duke of Hohenberg, was a grandson of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, an heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian Empire's throne. His assassination in 1914 is widely acknowledged to have sparked the outbreak of the First World War. Staterooms inside the 150-passenger boat feature tasselled shades, chic linens and pillows, and specially-made English Savoir beds .

Using a network of canals and rivers, the vessel will stop in Hoorn, Nijmegen, Rotterdam and Veer in the Netherlands before calling at Ghent and Antwerp in Belgium. For the inaugural cruise, prices start from \u00a32,504 per person. To upgrade to the royal suite, it will cost an additional \u00a33,175 per person. The year\u2019s most expensive cruise on the S.S.

Researchers have developed a new technique that allows them to test ancient weapons for residues left by toxic plant material added to them. Preliminary tests have suggested that a set of 4,000-year-old stone-tipped arrows from Egypt were coated with poisonous compounds including the plant Acokanthera. Dr Valentina Borgia, a specialist in paleolithic hunting weapons at the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research at the University of Cambridge, believes hunters may have been using toxic chemicals on their weapons up to 30,000 years ago. The image above shows arrows from China that were used in a crossbow that were dipped in poison . She said that Paleolithic hunters may have used poisonous pastes made from plants to help make their weapons kill prey more swiftly. Early humans may have evolved to throw spears allowing them to hunt around two million years ago, a new study has suggested. Scientists have found that the skeletons of early species of human changed to give them the ability to throw much like modern humans. A study of fossils of Homo erectus, an extinct human ancestor, shows that their shoulders and collar bone would have allowed them to hurl sticks accurately and powerfully. This would have enabled Homo erectus to become a proficient hunter, able to throw weapons like spears and rocks at potential prey. She said: 'It made good sense for people to use poisons. 'On their own, Palaeolithic weapons with stone arrowheads may not have been deadly enough to immobilise or kill a large animal such as a red deer. 'Poisonous plants were plentiful and the prehistoric population knew the environment where they lived, they knew the edible plants and their potential as medicines and poisons. 'To fabricate a poison is easy and economic, and the risk is minimal. In addition, the making of poisons is often part of the tradition and the rituality of hunting.' Dr Borgia has been working with forensic scientist Michell Cralin from Northumbria University and Dr Huw Barton, from the University of Leicester, to test for the presence of poisonous plants on prehistoric weapons. Using a technique called liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, which is used to detect traces of drugs by modern forensic scientists, they are examining residues left on the tips of ancient weapons. They are also looking for the presence of starch grains that may have been left on the weapons from toxic plant material. This wooden spatula from Malaysia wrapped in a palm leaf was used to apply poison to darts used for hunting . Dr Borgia has conducted tests on 4,000 year old arrow heads found in Egypt (left) that are thought to have been tipped with a poisonous black residue. The image on the right shows a pot of curare, a plant-based poison which is still used by some indigenous hunter-gatherers in South America to coat darts and arrows . They can then compare the results from these tests against a database of known poisonous plants. Dr Borgia has already collected samples from a number objects known to have contained poison and ancient weapons to test the technique. These include a 1926 Chinese pot containing Aconite poison inside, Malaysian darts tipped with the poison Upas, Chinese crossbow arrows and a number of African arrows. Many hunter gatherer societies are known to use poisons when they are hunting. The Yanomami people in the Amazon rainforest use curare - a mix of bark scrapings from Strychnos vines - to tip their darts and arrows when hunting. The use of curare was once common among indigenous populations in South America. The researchers have used starch grains like the ones shown on the left from the plant Aconitum napellus  to help identify poisonous materials. Aconitum was found inside this pot on the right thought to date from 1926 . In Africa hunters use another species of Strychnos to produce the poison strychnine, while other plants like Acokanthera, and Strophantus are also used. Hunters in Northern Asia are also known to have used monkshood to kill large animals such as bears and Siberian ibex. The seeds from yew trees are also thought to have been used to poison arrows. Dr Borgia has also collected black residue from six arrows that date from pre-dynasty Egypt. These 4,000-year-old arrows were first studied by scientists 40 years ago when small portons of the residue from the stone tips were injected into a cat. Opium, magic mushrooms and other psychoactive drugs have been used by humans for thousands of years. An anthropologist has discovered that humans have been cultivating and using mood-altering substances since the Stone Age. Professor Elisa Guerra-Doce has compiled evidence from around the world that Neolithic people were taking drugs derived from cacti in 8,600BC and that they were cultivating opium poppies by around 6000BC. Researchers have also found reddish stains on 13,000 year old human teeth found in a burial pit in Duyong Cave on Palawan Island in the southern Philippines, which are thought to be caused by chewing the leaves of the betel plant. It is still chewed through out much of Asia as a mild stimulant. Charred cannabis seeds have also been found in bowls that date from the Bronze age Pit-Grave culture that appeared in Romania around 2000BC. This bone harpoon in a museum in Cambridge carries a warning label that reads 'Care, Has been poisoned' The animal did not die but became ill, suggesting the presence of a poison. Dr Borgia said: 'Nowadays we have the right instruments to get more information without cruelty to animals. 'Initial tests strongly suggest the presence of Acokanthera, a poisonous plant on our database, but we can\u2019t be completely certain as there are a number of components in the compound. 'We know that the Babylonians, Greeks and Romans used plant-based poisons both for hunting animals and in war. 'In fact, the word \u2018toxic\u2019 come from toxon, the Greek for bow. Taxus is a genus of the yew tree with a springy timber traditionally used to make bows. 'It also produces seeds used to poison arrows. In Britain, yews grown for their timber were planted in churchyards so that animals wouldn\u2019t be poisoned by eating their berries. \u201cFew hunter-gatherer societies remain today but all the groups that have survived employ poisons.'", "reference": "Scientists at Cambridge University are testing ancient weapons for poisons .\nThey believe\u00a0paleolithic\u00a0hunters  used plant toxins up to 30,000 years ago .\nThis would have made stone tipped spears and arrows more lethal to prey .\nEarly tests on 4,000-year-old arrows from Egypt have shown signs of toxin .\nThe team now hope to test the tips of older weapons for signs of poison ."}, "95": {"id": "19bbb678b100b2667cd89ef8901927456fa9e52b", "article": "The world\u2019s first roller-skating artist has says she wants to reinvigorate traditional Chinese art for the next generation - by painting with wheels instead of a pen.

Chinese artist Tian Haisu paints her huge art using roller skates instead of the traditional calligraphy pen . The artist has adapted the skates so that they can hold a pot of paint, which releases as she weaves around the canvas .

The figures were obtained by S4C\u2019s current affairs programme Y Byd ar Bedwar. The university defended the New York visit, saying it was necessary in order to raise funds for future developments. Ms O'Neal, 60, was joined on the trip by vice-chancellor Professor John Hughes and his wife, Dr Xinyu Wu, the university's director of international development.

Jennifer Lopez does it too. And now Australian women are shelling out up to $3000 to learn how to do it. The Kardashians have turned the art of contouring, a technique that involves highlighting and shadowing the face, from a make up insider secret to something many women - and some men - have tried to master. The demand to learn the secret to a flawless face is so high in Australia that one Hollywood make up artist is in the country this week to teach sold-out workshops in Sydney and Melbourne. Scroll down for video . The Kardashian look: Australian women are embracing the contouring make up technique, which uses highlighting to 'sculpt' facial features . Behind the blush: Kim Kardashian is a huge fan of contouring, and revealed to fans what goes into her high maintenance make up look in this Instagram picture . Lilit Caradanian is a professional make up artist with a roster of celebrity clients and over 840,000 Instagram followers. The 30-year-old was flown here to teach the the techniques used by Kim Kardashian and Jennifer Lopez's 'glam squads' to groups of women who have shelled out up to $3000 each for a three-day master class. Lilit spoke to Daily Mail Australia during her Sydney workshop, which will be followed this week by more sold-out classes in Melbourne. Eager to learn: Australian women are embracing the trend, and some have shelled out up to $3000 for a master class this week to learn from a top Hollywood make up artist . Tricks of the trade: Make up artist Lilit Caradanian (pictured) says that '90 per cent' of her students and clients request contouring . 'Contouring is really popular over here,' she says. 'I always ask what the class wants to learn and right now contouring is 90 per cent of the feedback I get. 'My students who are make up artists tell me their clients come to them asking about contouring. The average consumer knows about contouring, but doesn\u2019t have the knowledge to do it themselves.' While the Kardashians are largely responsible for alerting the masses to the magic of contouring, Lilit credits Jennifer Lopez with pioneering the trend - even if her fans didn't know she was doing it at the time. 'JLo \u2013 it started with her. Scott Barnes, her former make up artist, created and then became a master of contouring,' Lilit says. 'And then he became Kim\u2019s make up artist, and she started carrying that look as well.' Makeover: Lilit shares her contouring technique with Daily Mail Australia . Before and after: The contouring technique can give the illusion of a different face shape, sculpted jawline and cheekbones . 1. Start with applying your foundation as normal . 2. Next take a peach-hued concealer, approximately two shades lighter than your skin and apply under the eyes to highlight, blending as you go . 3. Use the same concealer on the straight bridge of the nose, middle of the forehead and centre of the chin (think everywhere the light catches) and blend, blend, blend . 4. Next, take a contouring cream two shades darker than your foundation . Sculpt the face: Concealers, highlighters and contouring creams are used . 5. Swirl some of the contouring cream onto a brush and start by outlining around the hairline. This should look like you are \u2018framing\u2019 the face. Blend the contouring \u2018in\u2019 (starting from the outside of the face and blending inwards) 6. Finish the \u2018frame\u2019 by sweeping the colour under the jawline. 7. Trace the contour cream below the cheekbones, creating a triangle of colour that points to the corner of the lips . 8. Take some more colour and contour on either side of the bridge of the nose and also in the crease of the eyelid . 9. The final step is to blend, blend, blend using a foundation brush to ensure there are no firm lines . Illusion: Contouring can be used to slim a face, hide a double chin, and highlight cheek bones . So, what is contouring exactly? 'It\u2019s not just drawing lines on your face. It\u2019s about bringing out certain features we want and receding features we don\u2019t want to show so much,' Lilit tells DMA. 'If you have a double chin, you can contour it to make you look a little bit slimmer \u2013 it\u2019s an illusion. You\u2019re sculpting your features.' 'The ideal shaped face is the oval shape, so if you don\u2019t have that, you can contour your face in certain areas to create the illusion of the oval shape, and to bring out the features.' Lilit's clients have become savvy about contouring. 'A few years ago, when I\u2019d ask my clients what they want to do with their make up, they would say they wanted a smoky eye, some liner, lashes. Now it\u2019s just about contour. They don\u2019t care what you do with their eyes or lips, as long as they have contour. Pioneer: Jennifer Lopez was an early adopter of contouring . 'The bridal industry has taken this turn where the bride wants to feel like a celebrity the day of her wedding - all eyes on them. They want to feel like a Kardashian, they want to feel perfect.' Celebrities have embraced the art of contouring because it helps them photograph flawlessly. But how does it translate to real life? With heavy duty contouring taking up to an hour, Lilit says there are a few short cut methods that can be adapted for everyday. 'A woman shouldn\u2019t spend longer than 15 minutes getting ready in the morning. You don\u2019t need to highlight and contour every day. 'A simpler technique is with a powder bronzer, which you can use in the same way as a contour, it\u2019s easier, on the go, and you don\u2019t need to sit there and blend it for an hour. All you really need is some good base \u2013 tinted moisturiser or foundation, some bronzer so you don\u2019t look pale, blush, and you\u2019re good to go. In demand: Professional make up artist Lilit\u00a0Caradanian has over 840,000 Instagram followers and celebrity clients . There are a few different contouring methods, says Lilit. 'You can use heavier creams, which are great for photo shoots but not if you want your make up to last all day. There are also thinner, more liquid creams, which have more staying power.' And for Australia's humid climate, where woman are regularly victims to their carefully applied make up slipping off in the heat, Lilit recommends a powder base. 'For people with oily skin or if you live in a humid climate, you want to go with powder contouring versus cream contouring,' she advises. 'You\u2019re still going to get the same look, but with a lighter texture and feel on the skin.'

Built in 1829, it was the first jail to implement solitary confinement for every single inmate which is thought to have brought on mental illness. Even outside the tiny cells, guards would cover their heads with a hood so they remained in confinement even when they wandered through its stone halls. The prison, which closed its doors in 1971, is considered by many people as one of the most haunted buildings in America. Haunted halls: Eastern State Penitentiary was the first prison in America to implement solitary confinement and is believed to be one of the most haunted buildings in the country . Chilling: Thousands of hardcore prisoners housed within these tiny cells in the Philadelphia would live alone, eat alone and even exercised alone in tiny individual yards . Chilling: The guards would even cover the inmates' heads with a hood when they left their cells so they could not see any of the others or map out the prison in their minds . Cruelty: And they allegedly subjected the prisoners to inhumane torture methods like the 'mad chair', where they would cut off prisoners' circulation - necessitating amputations . Notorious: The prison even housed feared prohibition-era gangster Al Capone whose luxurious room has been restored for tourists . King among prisoners: Capone spent most of his one year sentence in relative comfort and was allowed to furnish his cell with antiques, rugs, and oil paintings . Ghostly sightings: The prison closed down in 1971 and reopened as a museum in 1996, but tourists still report ghostly sightings . Strange presence: Those who believe in ghost stories say the trouble souls of the mistreated inmates still roam Eastern State's crumbling hallways . Home: The prison designer's ambitious mechanical innovations placed each prisoner had his or her own private cell, centrally heated, with running water, a flush toilet, and a skylight . Its crumbling stone walls, dark corridors and claustrophobia-inducing cells once housed thousands of hardcore criminals. The Philadelphia prison's 142-year history is steeped in controversy and cruelty and those who believe in ghost stories say the troubled souls of inmates still roam the abandoned halls. They were severely mistreated by the prison guards who found a number of sick ways to punish those who misbehaved. According to NPR,\u00a0they would use a torture method called the 'water bath' where they would dunk the prisoner in water then hang them to dry in the cold outside until ice formed on the skin. They would also tie inmates so tightly in a device called 'the mad chair' that it would cut off circulation and necessitate amputations. And the worst offenders would be put in 'the hole', a pitch-black underground cell where they had no light, no human contact and little air. The solitary confinement system was eventually discarded when the prison became overcrowded but Eastern State is widely thought to have induced mental illness in many of its inhabitants. It housed infamous criminals like bank robber Willie Sutton and even Al Capone who headed a criminal syndicate illegally supplying alcohol during the prohibition in the early-1900s. Infamous: Housed inside great, stone walls - Eastern State was just as famous for its wagon-wheel design as it was for the cruelty inflicted on prisoners . Trapped: Prisoners at Eastern State were thought to have gone insane having been housed inside tiny cells with little light and air . Poltergeist: A man who helps maintain the building says he once walked into Cell Block 4 and felt an unknown force grab him so tight he could not move . Eerie atmosphere: Eastern State certainly has the appearance of a haunted building with its rusting walls and claustrophobia-inducing cells which once housed thousands of hardcore criminals . Blinded: To prevent distraction, knowledge of the building, and even mild interaction with guards, inmates were hooded whenever they were outside their cells . Torture: One of the punishments the guards used was called the 'water bath' where they would dunk inmates in water then hang them in the cold outside until ice formed on their skin . Punishment: And the worst offenders would be put in 'the hole', a pitch-black underground cell where they had no light, no human contact and little air . Cruel therapy: People who ran the prison believed that the criminals - living in total silence and left alone with  the ugliness of their crimes - would repent . Insanity: Critics say the exact opposite occurred and a life of isolation inside these strict, haunting walls drove many of them to madness . Too late: The solitary confinement system was eventually discarded but Eastern State is widely thought to have induced mental illness in many of its inhabitants . Since 1996 it has been a museum and Halloween attraction but visitors still report eerie sightings and noises from the once-notorious prison. Tourists claim there have been mysterious footsteps in the yard, the sound of pacing in empty cells and strange noises drifting through the ever-cold hallways. Cell Block 12 has become infamous for reports of chilling laughter and one guard tower sometimes appears to be occupied by a shadowy figure keeping watch over Eastern State. Gary Johnson, who helps maintain the crumbling old locks at the prison told NPR that he felt a force grip him so tight in Cell Block 4 that he was immobilised. He described a negative, horrible energy that exploded out of the cell and claims tormented faces appeared on the cell walls and one in particular took hold of him.", "reference": "Prisoners at Eastern State Penitentiary were kept in solitary confinement which some say induced mental illness .\nThe guards are believed to have tortured the inmates and covered their heads with hoods when outside the cells .\nShut down in 1971 and reopened in 1996 as a museum and Halloween attraction but ghostly sightings continue .\nVisitors have reported anguished cries coming from the cells and a shadowy figure who watches over the prison ."}, "102": {"id": "cd1e65c0ca9bdd45560ed3d355b80d8a25525d76", "article": "The average Wall Street bonus rose two percent in 2014 as hiring in New York City's financial sector picked up, according to a government report on Wednesday. The average bonus for New York City's security industry rose to $172,860 in 2014, the highest level since the financial crisis, said a report by the office of the New York State Comptroller. The loftier bonuses came despite a 4.5 percent drop in broker/dealer profits in 2014 to $16 billion, the report said. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. The average Wall Street bonus rose two percent in 2014 as hiring in city's financial sector picked up according to a government report . The decline in profits was due to weakness in some trading divisions, costly legal settlements at large banks and higher capital reserve requirements imposed by regulators after the financial crisis. The industry added 2,300 jobs in New York City in 2014, the first year of positive job growth in the sector since 2011. 'The cost of legal settlements related to the 2008 financial crisis continues to be a drag on Wall Street profits, but the securities industry remains profitable and well-compensated even as it adjusts to regulatory changes,' said New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. 'The resumption of job growth in the securities industry bodes well for New York's economy, but it remains to be seen whether this trend will be sustained.' 'One area that anecdotally we keep hearing is a growth sector is compliance,' DiNapoli said. The average increase in bonuses in 2014 was well below the rise notched in the previous two years. Average bonuses fell from a peak of $191,360 on average in 2006 to $100,850 in 2008 during the financial crisis. Average bonuses had fallen from a peak of $191,360 in 2006 to $100,850 in 2008 during the financial crisis . The average salary including bonuses on Wall Street was $355,500 in 2013, according to an October report from the comptroller's office. 'The compensation is five times the average for private employment in the city,' DiNapoli said. 'But it's a challenging work environment, and in recent years because of the downsizing it's been harder to get these positions.' Authorities have blamed inflated mortgage-backed securities that plummeted along with the U.S. housing market for the financial crisis in 2008. Regulatory reforms since have included larger reserve requirements, new limits on proprietary trading and measures intended to reduce risk. Securities firms now pay a smaller share of bonuses in the current year with more deferred. DiNapoli added that it's important to be concerned about excessive risk-taking and possible regulatory rollbacks to be sure there isn't another meltdown, noting the industry is key to the economic viability of the city and state. The goal should be a business model with sustainable profits, he said, not the short-term, high-risk, high-reward profits 'that invariably results in the periodic downturn or crash as we had.'", "reference": "Bonuses for New York City's security industry rose on average by two percent in 2014 .\nIncrease came despite 4.5 percent drop in broker/dealer profits .\nAverage bonuses had fallen from a peak of $191,360 in 2006 to $100,850 in 2008 during the financial crisis ."}, "103": {"id": "394057cd0ff626954d95e20c2328a3ab60707791", "article": "Paul Scholes has confirmed he will not be taking over as Oldham Athletic manager.

The men, all from the Het International Choreographic Arts Centre, got their big moment during a banquet hosted by Maxima and Willem-Alexander for the Danish royals.

The teenagers from Moorland High School, in Clitheroe, Lancashire, were said to have drunk wine, lager and spirits as they ate a meal at an Indian restaurant, alongside three staff members, the hearing was told. Deana Hall, 53, was dismissed from her job as a house parent following the incident, and now claims she was made a scapegoat and unfairly dismissed. Deana Hall, 53, was dismissed from her job as a house parent from Moorland High School, in Clitheroe, Lancashire after pupils were\u00a0said to have drunk wine, lager and spirits as they ate a meal at an Indian restaurant on a school trip . She was one of three boarding house staff who took the group of 27 teenagers to the Balti Stan Indian restaurant in Clayton-le-Moors for a meal. Yesterday, an employment tribunal in Manchester heard that none of the parents had given consent for the students to drink alcohol. But\u00a0Mrs Hall told the hearing it was not her responsibility to secure permission from the parents of the group of 15 to 18 year-olds, and was instead the responsibility of her superior. The hearing was shown a series of pictures allegedly showing students with alcohol and heard that one boy drank a glass of wine and three pints of lager, and that he bought a Jack Daniels with Coke for another student. It also heard how students were reportedly acting drunk and slurring their words. Head teacher Jonathan Harrison said in evidence that none of the students had been given permission by him to drink alcohol and none of their parents had consented. She was one of three boarding house staff who took the group of 27 teenagers to the Balti Stan Indian restaurant in Clayton-le-Moors for a meal. \u00a0But Mrs Hall told the hearing it was not her responsibility to secure permission from the parents of the group of 15 to 18 year-olds, and was instead the responsibility of her superior . Mrs Hall said it was the responsibility of her superior, boarding house manager, Deborah Richards, to secure the correct permissions. She added that Mrs Richards had said a glass of wine, paid for by the school, would be permitted. Mr Harrison, who represented the school at the tribunal, said that Mrs Hall had failed in her safeguarding duties and was guilty of gross misconduct by allowing students to get drunk. He also said that her actions placed the children in danger and the school could have been closed down as a result. Following the incident on Friday, May 16, 2014, Mrs Richards resigned her position and told the headteacher that she accepted full responsibility. Mrs Hall and her colleague Carol Cradock were suspended and attended an internal disciplinary hearing after which they were both dismissed. Mrs Hall, who lives in Clitheroe, appealed the decision but was unsuccessful. The mother-of-two and grandmother-of-one, who had worked at the school for more than 10 years, said that making sure that parental permission for school trips was secured was not her responsibility. The hearing was shown a series of pictures allegedly showing students from the school (pictured) with alcohol and heard that one boy drank a glass of wine and three pints of lager, and that he bought a Jack Daniels with Coke for another student. She also told the hearing that she did not see any student drinking more than a glass of wine or a pint of lager. Mr Harrison told the tribunal: 'She still can't accept that she did anything wrong and I think it's appalling. 'She brought the school into disrepute. She was in breach of the trust of the school and the parents and her conduct could have led to a serious injury to a student who, under the influence of alcohol, could have wandered out of the restaurant and into the path of a car which could have closed the school down. 'I find it impossible that she has not accepted any wrong doing.' Mrs Hall said: 'Mrs Richards rang me up afterwards and told me that she felt awful that we were going to lose our jobs because she had not done her job correctly. 'No student was drunk at all and we made sure of that at the end of the night. 'During my whole time at the school I had never seen a risk assessment and it was not part of my role. 'I would not have permitted alcohol at all if I had organised the trip but my boss said that it was ok and I had no reason not to trust her.' Citizen's Advice Bureau lawyer Angela Cuncliffe, who represented Mrs Hall, said: 'My client seems to have been made a scapegoat. 'She has lost a job she loved, her good name and quite a bit of money.' Judgement was reserved by Judge Rebecca Howard and is expected to be given in the next four weeks. Following the hearing Mr Harrison said: 'Sometimes we have to make very difficult decisions when looking to protect the welfare and needs of children.'

In fact, it was school boarding house staff who were supervising the pupils when the incident in question took place.

The BBC said at the weekend that its political editor is to take time off to have a tumour removed from his lung.

Stephen Smyth, whose Twitter \u2018handle\u2019 \u2013 his online name \u2013 includes an SNP logo, sent a message reading \u2018karma\u2019 direct to Mr Robinson, 51, and the BBC.

The comments were widely condemned \u2013 including by the SNP. Former Labour First Minister Lord McConnell said they were \u2018sick\u2019. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted her support, wishing Mr Robinson a speedy recovery. The presenter became a hate figure among some Nationalists during the referendum campaign, with protesters outside BBC Scotland\u2019s Glasgow headquarters calling for him to be sacked for what they saw as biased coverage. At the time, Alex Salmond refused to condemn them, calling the demonstrations \u2018joyous\u2019. During the referendum campaign, the SNP was constantly embarrassed by the online army of cybernats. JK Rowling and David Bowie were two of many who earned their wrath for speaking out in favour of the Union.

In the final nail-biting minute of the show he was asked the following historical question: 'The Burke and Wills expedition left Melbourne in which year?' The trivia buff correctly answered '1860' but said it left like a 'lifetime' before the big green tick rolled around, signalling a triumphant end to an extremely nerve-racking month. As his wife of 19 years, Jenny, joined him on stage for his winning moment on Friday afternoon, Mr Skarbek, from Hawthorn, Victoria, said although it would 'take a while to sink in', all he felt was overwhelming relief. \u2018It\u2019s incredible! I think at this stage it\u2019s more relief than anything seeing as it's been such a long process,\u2018 Mr Skarbek said. He admitted it's been a 'hard slog' but he relished the challenge and knew he wanted to take it all the way. 'It's about more than the money now. It's about proving to myself that I can do it,' he said. Being the curious man he is Mr Skarbek said if he walked away with the smaller jackpots of $500,000 or $750,000, he would never have stopped wondering if he could have made it to the million. \u2018I know I could have lived with taking the risk. If you\u2019re prepared and back yourself, you can live with loosing.' He was adamant that not knowing that would have eaten him alive. Mr Skarbek was quick to recognise he wasn't alone on his million dollar journey, crediting his wife for supporting and coaching him through the month long adventure.

His six-month treatment cost $50,000, putting further strain on the couple who said they were trapped in the renting cycle. 'My wife and I have been living hand to mouth and even had to call on our parents to help cover the blow-out on medical bills with my six-month cancer treatment. Million Dollar Minute has saved us,' he said. Things started to turn around when Mr Skarbek was given a clean bill of health and was told he had got on to the the show in the same week. 'Sometimes you get in a rut. You know things will improve eventually but it's hard to see how. Then I got the great medical news and found out I was going to make the show,' he said. 'A whole series of things just started coming my way.' With a 'life-changing' amount of money now sitting in his bank account Mr Skarbek said, after years of renting, he can't wait to become a home owner. 'When we were younger and had the chance to buy a house we could never find the perfect property. Then the market went berserk and although we were saving like crazy, we were shut out.\u2019 \u2018This will be the house that trivia built,\u2019 he joked. After buying a home Mr Skarbek says he'll use some of the prize money to take his wife around the world . Having a good understanding what it's like to struggle financially Mr Skarbek said his wife was adamant they share their good fortune by making a generous donation to the Smith Family. 'Jenny was thinking about how tough some people do it and what a magical thing it would be to win that money and help someone else that's in need,' he said. Not only will they satisfy their own wanderlust with a trip around the word, Mr Skarbek said his mother hasn\u2019t been back to her native Poland in 15 years and said he cant wait to send the 78-year-old home in style, on a business class flight.

'Ever since I was a little kid a lot of my family used to nickname me 'The Professor'. I was always reading,' he said. He spent his younger years travelling the world with his family which he said was the 'greatest gift' he was ever given. Mr Skarbek said he has been an avid trivia player at his local pub for as long as he can remember and was elated to find his years of training could be put to good use. 'This is the only chance I've had to actually do something with my trivia skills,' he said. After spending 15 years in the energy industry Mr Skarbek said he can't wait to leave his job and spend some time relaxing with his family. \u2018I have moments where I know it\u2019s happened and I have moments where sometimes it feels like a dream.\u2019 Mr Skarbek is the first Million Dollar Minute contestant to win the million dollar jackpot with his jackpot including $16,000 in \u2018safe money\u2019 he accumulated during the games.

Rowan advises a woman who has been asked out on a date by her younger gym trainer (picture posed by models) ANSWER: I have a friend who swears the best way for any middle-aged woman to make a decision is to ask themselves: \u2018What would Madonna do?\u2019 The Queen of pop would never let a trifling thing such as dignity stand between her and a hot young man. Nor did the director of 50 Shades Of Grey, Sam Taylor-Johnson, put decorum before personal happiness when she wed a much younger actor. Would it have been more seemly to deny herself an unbelievably handsome husband just to ensure the more censorious members of our society weren\u2019t scandalised? Of course, this kind of chutzpah is far easier to talk about than achieve. It comes more naturally to celebrities than mere mortals. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t borrow a little bit of that erotic entitlement. This man has gone out of his way to pursue you. It\u2019s also a bit daft, under the circumstances, to be fretful about your body. If he works in your gym, then surely he\u2019s got a good idea of your physique. The simple fact is that he fancies you rotten. In short, why don\u2019t you do this man a favour and take his request seriously? If he\u2019s interesting and sexy, you should simply assess him for these qualities. Treat him like any other man who might have the good sense to ask you out. Please say \u2018Yes!\u2019 \u2014 perhaps with the addendum: \u2018Because I\u2019m worth it!\u2019", "reference": "Sex columnist tackles a question from a woman whose husband left her .\nNow a young man at the gym wants to take her out on a date .\nRowan says Madonna and Sam Taylor-Johnson have made age gaps okay ."}, "112": {"id": "a2e9963e7f418cdb7516a9eadbe4b4c77e1dff52", "article": "A couple  who racked up thousands of pounds in debts with payday loan firms were evicted from their home and have been sleeping rough in their Ford Focus, it was revealed today. For the past two months Philip and Victoria Sherlock have been bedding down overnight in their old car, with their worldly belongings in its boot, on an industrial estate in Warrington, Cheshire. Times have become so tough they celebrated their wedding anniversary by sharing a Twix chocolate bar. The desperate pair borrowed \u00a3830 from lenders to try and cover their rent after Mr Sherlock, a self-employed landscape gardener, was forced to stop working through ill health in October. Tough times:\u00a0Philip and Victoria Sherlock have been forced to live in their Ford Focus after falling in to debt . Possessions: Everything the married couple own is piled into the car after they were evicted from their home in North Wales . But with interest rates of more than 1,000 per cent the debt soon spiralled out of control. Even though Mrs Sherlock, 32, was working 12 hours a week as a shop assistant, her \u00a36.50 an hour minimum wage salary was not enough to pay their \u00a3125-a-week rent. They fell behind and by Christmas owed more than \u00a32,000. In January they couple were evicted from their two bedroomed home, in Wrexham, north Wales, and have been living in the car ever since. Today there was no sign of the pair at the industrial unit, but CCTV footage from a local business appeared to confirm they had been arriving after dark and leaving early in the morning. Mr Sherlock, 41, told the Sun it was humiliating not being able to provide for his wife. \u2018We celebrated our ninth wedding anniversary a few days after moving all our belongings into the boot of our car,\u2019 he said. \u2018We sat there, shared a Twix chocolate bar and told ourselves we would turn this around. \u2018But the days have turned into weeks. As an adult couple who want to work, it\u2019s humiliating how far we have fallen. All I want to do is take care of my wife. But without a job, savings or a home, it\u2019s just impossible.\u2019 Rest: Mr Sherlock grabs some sleep in the car, which is usually based in a Warrington car park . Support: Mrs Sherlocks lays her head down - but the couple sleep in shifts so the other can keep an eye out . The couple\u2019s problems began in October when Mr Sherlock went into hospital for an operation on a twisted intestine. It meant he had to give up his \u00a3400-a-week job as a self-employed landscape gardener because it was too physical \u2013 a job he had done for the past 24 years. 5.45am: Couple wake up in the car and head to nearby shopping centre to use the toilet . 8am: Pasty each from bakery and then head to nearby pub for coffee and to charge phones . 11am: Victoria heads to work and Philip goes to the Job Centre . 5.30pm: Dinner of baguette and spaghetti hoops in the car . 8.30pm: Head to car park for the night and sleep in shifts . Instead he started claiming \u00a384 a week in tax credits while he looked for other work, but, with Mrs Sherlock\u2019s \u00a378-a-week income, the couple were bringing home just \u00a3162 a week. After paying their rent, they were left with just \u00a337 for food and bills and soon fell behind. In desperation they turned to payday loan firms, borrowing \u00a380 from 247Moneybox, at an annual rate of 1,309 per cent and \u00a3100 from Bongaloans at 1,272 per cent. They also borrowed \u00a3500 from Logbook Loans to cover the cost for their car. But they struggled with the repayments and within two months they were \u00a32,000 in debt. Mrs Sherlock said they sold their fridge, washing machine and even their bed but still couldn\u2019t stave off the bailiffs. \u2018We needed quick and easy cash so we didn\u2019t think twice,\u2019 she said. \u2018But it all got out of control and we ended up with bailiffs at our door.\u2019 Happier times: Mr and Mrs Sherlock, pictured on their wedding day, have seen their life decline after health and debt problems . Trouble: The pair have had to turn the Focus into their home because they claim they asked the council for help but say they were told they were not considered high risk enough for emergency accommodation . The couple put all their belongings in their car and drove to Warrington, where Mrs Sherlock works, to try to secure emergency accommodation. But officials at the Labour-run Warrington Council said they were not high risk enough to qualify and instead they were advised to put their names on a council house waiting list. Mr Sherlock, who has a 12-year-old son form a previous relationship, said the couple allow themselves just \u00a33 a day for food and use the toilets in supermarkets and showers in a local swimming baths daily. He spends most of his time at the local job centre while his wife is at work, before parking up in the industrial unit, which is close to a main train line, after dark. The couple have been sleeping rough in a five-door Ford Focus similar to the one shown in this file picture . He added: \u2018It\u2019s freezing sleeping (in the car.) \u2018It stays noisy until about 3am and I watch over my wife, feeling like such a failure. \u2018We\u2019ve cut down on the amount we eat. \u2018In the morning we share two pasties and drink coffee in Wetherspoons, which gives free refills. For dinner we split a baguette from a local bakery.\u2019 A spokeswoman for Warrington council said they couldn\u2019t comment on individual cases, but insisted they offered a wide range of support for people in need of accommodation in the area.

Dunga was handed the responsibility of rebuilding a fallen team from the ashes of a 7-1 semi-final defeat by Germany and 3-0 loss at the hands of Holland. His appointment was a controversial one among Brazil supporters, having guided his country in a lacklustre 2010 World Cup before he was sacked the last time. Brazil defender David Luiz looks devastated after the final whistle at the Mineirao Stadium in Belo Horizonte where the World Cup hosts had just been hammered 7-1 by eventual winners Germany . The Germans huddle to celebrate their fifth goal as the shell-shocked Brazilians head back to the centre . Dunga (right) has stepped up to take the Brazil job and has impressed with six wins from six matches . But when a nation was so embarrassed in their own backyard, a strong head was needed to take control and the 1994 World Cup winner was deemed the man for the job. \u2018We want to build a modern, compact, aggressive team but without losing the essence of Brazilian football - the dribble and the creativity,\u2019 Dunga said in Paris ahead of playing France. Six wins from six matches, clean sheets in the first five of those and only one goal conceded plus fourteen scored is the perfect response to former manager Luiz Felipe Scolari\u2019s failings last summer. Dunga has encouraged his full backs to sit deeper, opting for Porto\u2019s Danilo and Chelsea\u2019s Filipe Luis on the flanks despite the more attack-minded Marcelo performing well for Real Madrid. Barcelona\u2019s right back Dani Alves has also been a major casualty of the World Cup and Dunga has waved goodbye to Jo and Fred up front, who sound more like characters from a Last of the Summer Wine episode and played like them, too.

Thiago Silva is struggling to get back into the side at centre-back alongside Paris Saint-Germain team-mate David Luiz, even though his performances in the World Cup were praised and he missed the mauling by Germany due to injury. In Silva\u2019s absence after he missed the first match, a 1-0 win against Colombia, due to injury, Atletico Madrid\u2019s Miranda has forged a strong partnership with Luiz. The captaincy has also been taken off him and handed to Neymar, who has responded with six goals in as many games. They have more exciting options up front; Shakhtar Donetsk striker Luiz Adriano is currently this season\u2019s Champions League top-scorer and he is vying for a place as their No 9 with Diego Tardelli, who netted a double in a 2-0 win against Argentina. Silva (left) is struggling to get back into the side ahead of Miranda at centre back for Brazil . Neymar has scored six goals in six games since the World Cup and has been in fine form . There are still two places available in Brazil\u2019s attacking midfield three alongside Neymar, and Chelsea\u2019s Oscar and Willian are front-runners. Their pressing attacking play, instilled by Jose Mourinho, is a facet to forward players which particularly impresses Dunga. But another name emerging is 23-year-old Hoffenheim forward Roberto Firmino, who scored a 25-yard bullet to win their last match against Austria after being included in the squad for the first time. He is expected to start against France. Philippe Coutinho, brutally left out of the World Cup squad by Scolari, is another banging on the door, especially with his performances for Liverpool. Philippe Coutinho has been a star performer for Liverpool in recent months and will hope to shine for Brazil . Roberto Firmino (centre) is all smiles as he competes in a training drill at the Stade de France on Wednesday . Maintaining a core from the World Cup, Fernandinho, Ramires, Luiz Gustavo, have all been given chances in the middle. Dunga has also been experimenting with some nostalgic choices. He has just recalled 31-year-old Robinho to the squad, even though he has had a mediocre spell back in Brazil with Santos on loan from AC Milan. He is a favourite of Dunga, but not of the fans. Back in October, Kaka, another surprise omission from the World Cup, also got a late call-up as a replacement for the friendlies against Argentina and Japan. He came on for the last eight minutes against Argentina and 14 against Japan (a game they won 4-0) but has not made it into the latest squad.

But that isn't the end of the nail-biting ride - when given the option to take the money and run Mr Skarbek opted to risk the $500,000 for a chance of becoming a millionaire. As his wife of 19 years, Jenny, joined him on stage for his winning moment on Monday, Mr Skarbek, from Hawthorn, Victoria, said he had been given a second chance at life and was determined not to waste it. 'I came here to win $1 million and that is what I am going to do,' he said. Mr Skarbek told Daily Mail Australia that the moment he decided not to take the $500,000 was the moment it 'stopped being about the money.' 'It's about more than the money now. It's about proving to myself that I can do it. 'A lot of people might think it's crazy not to leave with the $500,000 and I know it would have been so easy, but I do back myself.' Mr Skarbek hit financial trouble after being diagnosed with mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. His six-month treatment cost $50,000, putting further strain on the couple who said they were trapped in the renting cycle. 'My wife and I have been living hand to mouth and even had to call on our parents to help cover the blow-out on medical bills with my six-month cancer treatment. Million Dollar Minute has saved us,' he said. Things started to turn around when Mr Skarbek was given a clean bill of health and was told he had got on to the the show in the same week. After missing out by only one question last week Mr Skarbek was delighted to finally reach the $500,000 milestone . Mr Skarbek, who spent years dragging his wife Jenny to pub trivia nights, got into debt when he had to pay sky-high medical bills to treat his cancer . 'Sometimes you get in a rut. You know things will improve eventually but it's hard to see how. Then I got the great medical news and found out I was going to make the show,' he said. 'A whole series of things just started coming my way.' He said it was also a 'great comfort' knowing he had already locked in a pretty substantial prize of more than $300,000. Upon learning he had secured the safety jackpot, Mr Skarbek said his wife suggested he should should share their good fortune, donating to The Smith Family charity. Mr Skarbek says his\u00a078-year-old mother Sophie has always supported him, with his parents helping him and wife financially . 'Jenny was thinking about how tough some people do it and what a magical thing it would be to win that money and help someone else that's in need,' he said. Surprisingly, Mr Skarbek said he wasn't a particularly good student at school, instead saying he inherited his thirst for knowledge from his father. 'Ever since I was a little kid a lot of my family used to nickname me 'The Professor'. I was always reading,' he said. Mr Skarbek, pictured as a child with family members, said travelling the world was the 'greatest gift' he was given . He spent his younger years travelling the world with his family which he said was the 'greatest gift' he was ever given. A young Mr Skarbek was nicknamed 'The Professor' Mr Skarbek said he has been an avid trivia player at his local pub for as long as he can remember and was elated to find his years of training could be put to good use. 'This is the only chance I've had to actually do something with my trivia skills,' he said. With a 'life-changing' amount of money coming his way, Mr Skarbek said it was his wife that was having trouble comprehending how much their lives will change. He plans to become a homeowner after spending years renting and wants to satisfy his wanderlust by taking his wife to Europe for the first time. Being the sensible man he is Mr Skarbek said he won't be rushing to hand in his notice at work however after spending 15 years in the energy industry he thinks might use his passion for trivia to get into the entertainment business.

Findings from a new US study underline the need to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions, it is claimed. More than 3 million Britons are diagnosed with diabetes and nine out of ten have type 2 which occurs when the body gradually loses the ability to process blood sugar. Researchers  looked at the number of antibiotic prescriptions given to 200,000 diabetics a year before they were diagnosed, and found those given at least two courses had a higher chance of getting the condition . Type 2 is strongly linked to lifestyle factors such as being overweight or obese, leading a sedentary lifestyle and eating an unhealthy diet. Researchers from the Departments of Gastroenterology and Medical Oncology at the University of Pennsylvania carried out the investigation. They looked at the number of antibiotic prescriptions given to more than 200,000 diabetics in the UK at least one year before they were diagnosed with the disease, and compared this to the number given to 800,000 non-diabetic patients of the same age and sex. They found that patients prescribed at least two courses of penicillins, cephalosporines, quinolones and macrolides were at higher risk of being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The risk increased with the number of antibiotic courses prescribed, says a report in the European Journal of Endocrinology (must credit). More than 3million Britons have diabetes and nine out of ten have type 2 which occurs when the body loses the ability to process blood sugar . Patients prescribed 2-5 courses of penicillins \u2013 used for a variety of infections - increased their risk of diabetes by 8 per cent. The risk increased by 23 per cent for those having more than five courses of penicillins. Patients having 2-5 courses of quinolones, used in respiratory and urinary tract infections, had an increased diabetes risk of 15 per cent, which rose 37 per cent for those having more than five courses. The risk was calculated after adjusting for other risk factors such as obesity, smoking history, heart disease and history of infections. Study leader Dr Ben Boursi said \u2018Gut bacteria have been suggested to influence the mechanisms behind obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes in both animal and human models. \u2018Previous studies have shown that antibiotics can alter the digestive ecosystem.\u2019 senior author Dr Yu-Xiao Yang added: \u2018While our study does not show cause and effect, we think changing levels and diversity of gut bacteria could explain the link between antibiotics and diabetes risk.\u2019 There was no increase in risk associated with use of antivirals or anti-fungal medications and the study found little evidence of a link between antibiotic use and the risk of type 1 diabetes. Dr Boursi said \u2018Over-prescription of antibiotics is already a problem around the world as bacteria become increasingly resistant to their effects. \u2018Our findings are important, not only for understanding how diabetes may develop, but as a warning to reduce unnecessary antibiotic treatments that might do more harm than good.\u2019 Prof Jodi Lindsay, Professor of Microbial Pathogenesis, St George\u2019s, University of London, said \u2018Patients with type 2 diabetes have an increased risk of developing infections, and therefore they are more likely to be prescribed antibiotics to treat those infections. \u2018In the year prior to diabetes diagnosis, patients may show some signs of disease and may also have a higher risk of infection, and therefore receive more antibiotics. \u2018This is a very large and helpful study linking diabetes with antibiotic consumption in the UK public, but at this stage we don\u2019t know which is the chicken and which is the egg. \u2018The idea that antibiotics might contribute to diabetes development might be important and more research needs to be done.\u2019", "reference": "Researchers probed antibiotic prescriptions to 200,000 diabetes sufferers .\nFound those given two or more courses were more likely to be diabetic .\nThree million Britons are diabetic, and 95 per cent suffer from Type 2 ."}, "117": {"id": "94f611057784f1d30cd62f5f853b8c86bd971823", "article": "It was a bloody Monday on the streets of Chicago as gunmen shot 14 people, killing three and wounding 11.

And yet, if this amazing ossuary was false, then it was one of the greatest forgeries in history. Underlying the question of the authenticity of the ossuary is an even bigger theological problem: whether or not Jesus actually had any brothers. Though the debate's origins are ancient, the answer still divides Catholics and Protestants. For Catholics, Mary, Joseph and Jesus are a family unit unto themselves. Yet Catholic theology also holds that Jesus was God's son, born of the virgin -- and that Mary did not give birth to other children, divine or otherwise. 'Finding Jesus': John the Baptist Q&A . So who are these \"brothers\" that the Gospel of Mark mentions? The Rev. James Martin, author of the book \"Jesus: A Pilgrimage,\" calls the relationship between James and Jesus \"very complicated.\" \"He's called clearly the brother of the Lord, and the Greek uses the common word for brother,\" Martin says. But Catholics also believe in Mary's perpetual virginity, so Martin surmises that James and the other brothers were Joseph's children from a prior marriage.\"It makes sense that Joseph would have been older and Mary was younger, so I see them in a sense as stepbrothers.\" Other Catholic scholars see James and Jesus  as cousins, an idea that began in the fourth century, when St. Jerome, who translated the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament into Latin, argued the point against the theologian Helvedius, who said Mary and Joseph had other children. 'Finding Jesus': Shroud of Turin Q&A . Jerome countered that these children were instead born to Mary of Clopas, Jesus' aunt. Jerome used his linguistic facility to argue that \"adelphios,\" the Greek word used for Jesus' brothers and sisters, could refer to cousins, as well as to siblings. Protestants, however, see Jesus' family as free of ambiguity, with Mary and Joseph having several children. One of them is Jesus -- but the question then becomes, which one? Ben Witherington III, professor of New Testament Interpretation at Asbury Theological Seminary, offers the Protestant view that Jesus and James were full brothers, with Jesus being the elder. \"The New Testament says nothing about Mary being a perpetual virgin, it says she virginally conceived Jesus, and it certainly implies that she went on to have more children after that, and his brothers and sisters are in fact his brothers and sisters,\" Witherington says. Is Judas in hell? Jesus is presented as the older brother who leaves the family and walks about in Galilee and Judea, has a ministry and leaves James and the other brothers and sisters in charge of the family, according to the scholar. What's more contentious for some Protestants, is the fact that Jesus, as the eldest in the family, essentially forsook his obligation as next-in-line to head the family after Joseph died. Instead he followed his divine destiny, as ordained by his father in heaven. 5 things you didn't know about Jesus . That left James to fill the void. Whatever he was -- brother, step-brother or cousin -- we know that James became important in the early Christian church because of his relation to Jesus. Paul, the apostle who transformed the new religion from a local phenomenon into a movement throughout the Roman Empire, says as much in his letter to the Galatians: . \"Then after three years I did go up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and stayed with him 15 days;  but I did not see any other apostle except James the Lord's brother.\" James and Peter and Paul were the prime movers of this new faith, with James the leader of the Jesus followers in Jerusalem until he was martyred in 64 CE, forgiving his killers with his last breath, just as his brother Jesus had done. Given his importance to the early Christian Church, why wouldn't he be connected to his brother, or even stepbrother, on the burial box containing his bones?

A teenage mother has died after giving birth to twins eight weeks before their due date without ever getting the chance to hold her newborn babies. Sophie Burgess gave birth to Evie and Oliver at Wolverhampton New Cross Hospital after suffering cramps. The 19-year-old, who was unconscious when the babies were born, contracted septicaemia and was rushed into a critical care unit. She died 48 hours later having never met the babies. Her family have since paid tribute to the teenager who 'could not wait' to become a mother. On March 11, Miss Burgess from Telford, Shropshire, rushed to Princes Royal Hospital with her partner Alex Carter, 23, after experiencing cramps. She was transferred to the hospital in Wolverhampton where she gave birth to Oliver naturally. Doctors were then forced to perform an emergency Caesarean section to safely deliver Evie, with Miss Burgess unconscious throughout the procedure. Miss Burgess was moved to the hospital's critical care unit but died 48 hours later. Speaking of his younger sister, who worked as a care worker, \u00a0Miss Burgess's brother, Craig, said: 'It is so sad that my sister never got to hold her children but Alex has not left their side since. Miss Burgess gave birth to Oliver naturally before doctors were forced to perform an emergency Caesearean to safely deliver Evie . 'They are out of the incubators now and both seem to be doing well. They are amazing and Sophie would have been so proud of them. 'I honestly cannot begin to describe Sophie, she was full of life. She could not wait to become a mother and as a family we will make sure her babies never forget her. They are her legacy now.' Miss Burgess's mother, Mandy, said the family did not know what had caused the 19-year-old to contract septicaemia which is poisoning in the blood. 'Sophie contracted septicaemia after giving birth to her twins, the reason behind this is still unknown but the hospital have been conducting their own investigations. 'We are now planning Sophie's funeral.' She had been living at the family's Telford home with her partner throughout her pregnancy. The babies weighed just 3lbs each once delivered eight weeks early in Wolverhampton's New Cross Hospital . The babies' father, Alex Carter, has 'not left their side' since their mother's death last week. They remain in incubators . 'Sophie and her boyfriend, Alex, lived at home with me while she was pregnant and we will be helping him alongside his family to bring up the twins when they get out of hospital.' 'He has been an exceptional dad to Oliverand Evie so far.' A friend of the family has set up an online donations page\u00a0to contribute towards the twins' upbringing as doctors at Wolverhampton New Cross Hospital investigate what caused the young mother to take ill. Ria Norris, who grew up with Miss Burgess, said she would have been 'a fantastic mother'. 'She was so prepared for it. With her being young people might think they wouldn't t have been but both she and Alex really were.' Friends and relatives said Miss Burgess 'could not wait to become a mother' After being told that she might struggle to conceive children when she was younger, the care worker was 'over the moon' to learn she was pregnant last year, she added. 'She was absolutely elated. The whole family was,' said Mrs Norris, 32. 'Sophie loved being pregnant, she absolutely thrived on it. I think having been told that it might be difficult she just totally embraced it.' 'The twins are the first grandchildren in the family so it's very special.' Mr Carter was equally excited having been with Miss Burgess for years, she said. 'Alex was over the moon. He hasn't left the babies' side since they were born either. 'It's amazing when in a situation where he might have some emotions, he doesn't have any resentment towards anyone. 'He is amazing.' New Cross Hospital has launched an investigation into what may have caused Miss Burgess to contract septicaemia. Jonathan Odum, medical director at the hospital, said staff had been 'deeply affected' by the young mother's death. 'Sadly Sophie developed a severe illness following the birth of her twins from which she deteriorated very quickly,' he said. 'Despite the best efforts of the medical and nursing staff looking after her, she passed away on a critical care unit a few hours later. 'The staff in the maternity department and the critical care unit have been deeply affected by Sophie's death and the trust would like to pass on it's sympathy and condolences to her family and friends.

Medics at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary say they treated a 23-year-old cyclist for an E.coli 0157 infection after he was admitted to the hospital suffering from vomiting, abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea. The man - a vegetarian - said he had not eaten undercooked meat or vegetables, nor had he spent time with livestock or visiting farms before falling ill. A man was treated for E. coli which doctors believe he contracted after taking part in a Tough Mudder event and was splashed with infected mud (file picture) But eight days before his symptoms began the man had competed in a cycling event along wet, muddy tracks in eastern Scotland. He, along with other competitors, had removed the mudguards from his bicycle to reduce weight, and mud and water had splashed on his face during the race. It is thought this was how he became infected with the bug, which can be found in animal faeces and farm slurry. The man said he had taken part in a 'Tough Mudder' event, which involves a 10 -12 mile race with obstacles such as climbing vertical walls and plunging through ice pools. The cyclist, who has not been identified, recovered - but the doctors have highlighted his case in the Journal of Infection Prevention. Writing in the research paper, the doctors warned: 'Sporting endeavours such as cycling and cross-country running events often take participants through such high-risk areas and may be an important cause of contact with E. coli 0157. 'This case highlights such exposure and should alert clinicians to the possibility of E.coli 0157 infection and the importance of individuals presenting with bloody diarrhoea with a history of participation in similar sporting or other events.' Escherichia coli, often known as E. coli, are bacteria found in the digestive systems of many animals, including humans. Most strains are harmless but some can cause serious illness. Most cases of E. coli food poisoning occur after eating undercooked beef (particularly mince, burgers and meatballs) or drinking unpasteurised milk. The incubation period for food poisoning caused by E. coli is usually 3-4 days, but it's possible for symptoms to take longer to appear (up to two weeks). Source: NHS Choices . Dr Robert Laing, consultant physician in Infectious Diseases and Internal Medicine at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and co-author of the journal article, said: 'We know that E.coli 0157 survives well in cattle faeces. 'This case highlights the possible risk to participants in sports that expose them to mud that may have been contaminated by animal faeces. 'Splashes to the face are likely to be particularly hazardous and efforts should be made to protect yourself from these as far as possible.' E.coli 0157, which lives in the gut of animals, is usually associated with food poisoning or drinking contaminated water. Scotland has a particularly high incidence of the strain, with more than twice as many cases than other parts of the UK. In 2012, three people contracted E.coli 0157 infection following a 12-mile 'Tough Mudder' event at Drumlanrig Castle, Dumfriesshire, which involved immersion or contact with mud. Also in 2012, a study of one of the world's largest mountain bike races, the 95k Birkebeinerrittet in Norway, which annually attracts 19,000 participants, found that when mudguards were attached to bikes, there were fewer cases of gastrointestinal illness. Health Protection Scotland warned anyone taking part in outdoor sports such as running or cycling and  crossing areas that might contain animal faeces are at risk of picking up E.Coli (pictured in a petri dish) A Health Protection Scotland spokesman said today: 'Anyone taking part in outdoor sports such as running or cycling\u00a0- and events that cross areas that have recently been occupied by animals such as cattle or sheep - should be aware of the risks of picking up a gastro-intestinal infection such as Vero cytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC), more commonly referred to as E.coli. 'One of the main risks to humans is from coming into contact directly or indirectly with contaminated animal faeces.

The Australian government said a first contingent of officials and supplies arrived in Port Vila around noon Sunday and more flights were expected to follow. \"In Port Vila, there's a lot of activity now -- people are starting to emerge,\" said Tom Perry of the aid group CARE International. \"You can see trees that are strewn across roads being chopped down. The evacuation centers are beginning to be set up.\" Perry, who arrived on one of the first Australian military flights into Port Vila, told CNN the damage there was \"very significant\" with trees that looked like \"snapped toothpicks.\" \"It's like a bomb has gone through,\" said journalist Michael McLennan, who lives in Port Vila. \"It's really quite apocalyptic.\" Most buildings in the capital were destroyed or damaged, he told CNN on Sunday. Many roads were blocked by fallen trees or power lines. The main objective now is to get disaster response teams into Vanuatu and kick-start the humanitarian operation, Sune Gudnitz, regional head for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, told CNN from Fiji, about 600 miles away. His aid agency has had word of much destruction on Efate, the island where Port Vila is located, and from the southern island of Tanna, he said. Only a little information has so far trickled out from beyond the capital, but Gudnitz said he fears the worst. \"Unfortunately, the more that comes out, the worse it looks,\" he said. Vanuatu President Baldwin Lonsdale, who was at a U.N. conference on disaster risk reduction in Japan on Saturday, issued an appeal to the global community to help his shattered nation. Vanuatu has officially declared a state of emergency, opening the door for other countries to help. Vanuatu's remote location adds to the challenges the international response faces. Port Vila is more than 1,770 kilometers (1,100 miles) northeast of Brisbane on Australia's east coast, and some 2,200 kilometers (1,367 miles) north of Auckland, the closest city in New Zealand. Reaching the more isolated communities will also take time. Vanuatu's archipelago -- comprising 83 small islands, about 65 of them inhabited -- is roughly 850 kilometers (528 miles) long. Many of the people are subsistence farmers, said CNN's Bill Weir, who visited Vanuatu recently. He recalled talking to a resident who built the first indoor bathroom on his island and sought advice on where to find a toilet paper dispenser. \"It's setting them back years,\" Weir said of the storm. People away from the capital live much as their ancestors did generations ago. Homes are built of weak materials, including straw and corrugated steel, that stood little chance against Pam's raging winds. \"When you've got a Category 5 cyclone that essentially just sat here for 24 hours -- where do you go when you have a storm that powerful?\" Perry of CARE International said. \"It's very terrifying to think about what people have been through.\" While international teams are finding a way in, it will be up to humanitarian agency staffers on the ground and the local communities themselves to do what they can to get by amid the wreckage. Aid workers said the most immediate challenge is to get clean water to people. Many people will be spending another night in emergency shelters. Track the storm . Pam is the South Pacific's second strongest cyclone since record-keeping began in 1970. And it's the strongest of any type since Super Typhoon Haiyan smashed into the Philippines in 2013, killing more than 6,000 people.

The immediate goal is to pass the milestone of 500 career victories \u2014 he is within one win of doing so after beating Colombia\u2019s Santiago Giraldo 6-3, 6-4 in the third round of the Miami Open. Murray can pass the mark on Tuesday if he defuses the huge serving power of giant South African Kevin Anderson. Andy Murray could become the first British tennis player to win 500 career games if he beats Kevin Anderson . Should Murray survive that encounter, it is possible he could edge ahead of Rafael Nadal and move back up to No 3 in the world rankings, although that also depends on the performances of others here. Going past 500 is something nobody can take away from him, however, and it will stand as testament to his consistency at the top of the game. Since tennis went open in 1968 \u2014 the old barriers between amateurs and professionals torn down to make a unified circuit \u2014 only 45 men have clocked that many wins. Only eight who are currently active have managed it. Murray defeatedSantiago Giraldo of Columbia in their third round match during the Miami Open . No British player in that time has got there, Tim Henman pulling stumps on his career within four of the mark. Murray said: \u2018It\u2019s nice because when you see the list of players who have won this many matches there aren\u2019t loads. \u2018Even if it doesn\u2019t happen here then at some stage I\u2019m sure I will get there. Murray could leap ahead of Rafael Nadal in the rankings if he beats Anderson in the fourth round . \u2018I obviously want to win more and hopefully I still have quite a few years ahead of me to add to that number. \u2018It\u2019s not easy in this era to win that many matches, so it\u2019s a good sign.\u2019 Of those Murray victories, 24 have come so far at this event, making it his most productive Masters level tournament. Murray and Giraldo shake hands after their match which saw the Scot progress to the next round . Factors like it being a familiar training base for Murray \u2014 he has a home only three miles away from this Key Biscayne island site \u2014 and the tendency for it to be windy during the tournament have all contributed to that. He is one of the best at adapting to such conditions. After two days of unsettled weather that have hardly enhanced South Florida\u2019s reputation for reliable sunshine, it was a regulation glorious morning as he kicked off the programme against Giraldo, one of the steady trickle of decent tennis players who come out of Colombia. The No 27 seed, who beat Murray in their previous meeting on the clay of Madrid last year, is the kind of opponent who illustrates that racking up the wins on the ATP Tour is hardly a straightforward endeavour. Murray's form is improving as the season continues and he looks in good shape for Wimbledon . He gives the ball an almighty biff from the back court but was slowly unpicked by Murray\u2019s clever mix of angles and spins. The Scot definitely looks a better player than he did a year ago, although the tendency towards the odd lapse in concentration is still evident. He let the South American, as usual enjoying good support in this part of the world, creep back from 5-1 down in the second set but then served it out at the second time of asking.

It was perhaps fitting, then, that Dick Advocaat marked his first game in charge with a defeat, a fourth in six matches to leave the Black Cats perilously perched one point above the drop zone. Not even the re-introduction of top goalscorer Adam Johnson \u2013 on as a second-half substitute after the club lifted his suspension following his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with an under-age girl \u2013 could inspire a side who have won just once in 2015. Gus Poyet paid for that run with his job this week, but Advocaat must repair those ruins if his own CV is not to be stained with a first relegation in 28 years in the dugout. Diafra Sakho scored a late winner to earn West Ham all three points against Sunderland in the Premier League encounter . Sakho struck from a tight angle in the 88th minute to earn his West Ham side all three points against Sunderland . The Senegalese striker shot past Santiago Vergini and into the bottom corner in the dying minutes . Sunderland goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon watches on in despair as Sakho finds the bottom corner of his net late on . Stewart Downing and James Collins celebrate a hard-fought victory for West Ham at Upton Park on Saturday evening . Indeed, the Dutchman suggested on Friday that he was \u2018relegation proof\u2019. Let\u2019s hope he is also immune to criticism, for without wins the honeymoon period will expire far quicker than his nine-game contract. Advocaat, though, might have celebrated victory on his Premier League bow had former Hammer Jermain Defoe not spurned a first-half sitter. The home fans were jeering him before that miss. Their cheers were laced with irony by the time he was substituted on 88 minutes after a dire display. Within 30 seconds of his exit Diafra Sakho was showing Defoe how to locate the back of the net as he smashed an uncompromising winner. It would have made for painful viewing for Defoe and Advocaat, especially as there was a strong suspicion of a foul on Seb Larsson seconds before Sakho hammered his 12th of the season to lift Sam Allardyce\u2019s side to ninth.

Adam Johnson made a return to the Sunderland first-team squad as he took up a place on the bench . Johnson came off the bench in the 73rd minute in place of Steven Fletcher after the club lifted his suspension . And Advocaat said: \u2018The luck was not on our side. Everybody saw it (the foul) and not the referee, but I do not want to complain. \u2018I can take confidence from that performance. If Defoe scores they have to take more risks and we would have got more space. It was a chance and a player of his quality should at least hit the target. \u2018But I did not expect the goal from West Ham because everything was under control.\u2019 Allardyce agreed with his opposite number. \u2018It was probably a foul but it\u2019s about time something went for us,\u2019 he said. \u2018In the end it was a devastating decision for Sunderland because we scored on the back of it. \u2018But I thought we deserved to win. We\u2019re heading for the best points total we\u2019ve had since we\u2019ve been back in the Premier League. You can\u2019t ask for more than that.\u2019 For Advocaat, this is no time for hard-luck stories and the 67-year-old needs to draw on his experience \u2013 even though none of it is in the English top-flight \u2013 to avoid the ignominy of a first demotion. He did answer one career-long criticism with his first team selection, three strikers in the starting XI a rebuttal to those who suggested the defensive-minded coach would try to spoil his way to survival. Dick Advocaat was an animated figure on the touchline in his first match in charge of the Black Cats . Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe takes on West Ham's Cheikhou Kouyate on his return to Upton Park . Sunderland's Jack Rodwell holds off the challenge from West Ham United midfielder Alex Song . West Ham midfielder Mark Noble turns away from Sunderland's Jordi Gomez and looks for a pass . Two of those frontmen combined in the seventh minute to carve the game\u2019s first opening. Defoe scampered down the right wing before locating Connor Wickham who, 18 yards out, controlled eloquently on his chest before smashing a volley down the throat of Adrian, the Spaniard fisting to safety. Steven Fletcher \u2013 the third of Advocaat\u2019s attacking trio \u2013 then sprung Defoe clear with a headed flick but the former resident failed to silence the locals as he spooned woefully wide. Advocaat wore a pained expression at the passing of what was the sort of chance Defoe would have dispatched in his pomp. And he would have looked even more horrified had Sakho\u2019s header \u2013 from Aaron Cresswell\u2019s whipped centre \u2013 bounced inside the post rather than inches wide with Costel Pantilimon beaten. It had not taken long for Advocaat to vacate his dugout earlier in the half and the Little General spent the bulk of the opening period barking orders from the touchline. He had promised to run on the pitch and reprimand any players who did not adhere to his instruction, and Jack Rodwell was very nearly the first to incur his wrath when one pass was jettisoned straight out of play. And he might have been tempted to bolt on and drag Defoe from the action within minutes of the second half when a promising attack broke down following a feeble back-heel from the forlorn frontman. Johnson eventually emerged to warm up just after the hour mark and was predictably the subject of taunts. Sunderland defender Wes Brown had his match cut short early as he was forced off injured . Brown hobbled off in the 12th minute and was replaced by Santiago Vergini at Upton Park in the Premier League clash . Sunderland forward Jordi Gomez evades a challenge from West Ham's Cameroon midfielder Song . But the home fans soon forgot about his presence amid the injustice of the refereeing error which cost them a penalty and a certain red card for Santiago Vergini. Carl Jenkinson loaded a deadball forward from his own half and John O\u2019Shea inadvertently flicked on to Kevin Nolan, lurking in the six-yard area. The Hammers skipper, however, was denied a strike on goal by Vergini\u2019s man-handling act but the flag was up for offside, the assistant having mistaken O\u2019Shea\u2019s head for that of a home player. But West Ham did enjoy a spot of good fortune seconds before Sakho\u2019s winner when Larsson was flattened by Nene.

And in just two and a half months last summer one family of five munched their way from the post-war era to modern times to reveal how dramatically things have changed. The Robshaws found the 1950s wholegrain National Loaf particularly hard to stomach, and ten-year-old Fred was overjoyed when sweets came off the ration. The Robshaw family took on a culinary challenge to eat as a family would have in each decade from the 1950s to the 1990s. Pictured (from left) Rosalind, mother Rochelle, Fred, father Brandon and Miranda 'in the 1950s' Forty years later, the Robshaws found themselves eating in the Nineties, sampling such delights as homemade pasta.\u00a0'Within living memory, the way we eat has been utterly transformed,' remarked Mr Robshaw . The experiment, filmed for a six-part TV programme, ended with the family feeling extremely grateful for the variety of foods available today. Back In Time For Dinner, which starts on BBC2 next Tuesday, follows the Robshaws \u2013 Brandon, 53, Rochelle, 52, and their children Miranda, 17, Rosalind, 15 and Fred \u2013 from the 1950s to the end of the millennium, with the final episode casting an eye towards the future of food. In the 1950s the children had to wait patiently for their father to finish his dinner, knowing his leftovers would be their supper. The 1960s saw the birth of the sugary cereal, while motorway service stations became almost fashionable as places to eat. Vesta convenience meals were available and the more adventurous home cooks could buy exotic foreign ingredients such as garlic and olive oil \u2013 from the chemist. Baking supremo Mary Berry teaches the Robshaws how to make a cake as it would have been done in the 1950s (pictured) for the\u00a0six-part TV programme 'Back In Time For Dinner', which airs on BBC next Tuesday . The Hairy Bikers' Dave Myers pictured with the Robshaw family as they sample the food of the Sixties . In the early 1950s, families ate bread - often the rationed 'National loaf' - and left-over roasted meat fat aka 'dripping' for breakfast (left), before Cornflakes (right) made their first appearance in the UK in the 1960s . In the 1970s, working women were learning to balance their careers with cooking for the family. The decade also saw the rise of the Pot Noodle. In the 1980s goats cheese, mange tout and kiwi fruit became the foods to impress your dinner party guests. Gourmet dishes and nouvelle cuisine took over from the simple but hearty dishes of earlier decades. By the 1990s, sushi and curry were as popular as traditional English dishes and ready meals became the norm. The programme also shows how fridges, freezers, microwaves and even televisions revolutionised the way the country ate, and how the rise of supermarkets changed shopping forever. The Robshaws found that food in the 1970s was brightly-coloured - but perhaps less enticing - than before . Families began to get a taste for spicier food in the sixties and  Vesta introduced an early ready meal in the shape of a beef curry. In the same era, cooks could buy  ingredients such as garlic and oil from the chemist . Spaghetti bolognese arrived in the UK from Italy in the sixties... and it hasn't left British dining tables since . Mr Robshaw, a freelance journalist and children\u2019s writer, said 1950s-style rationing left them feeling hungry all the time and was particularly hard on Fred, who \u2018literally danced with joy the day sweets came off the ration\u2019. He went on: \u2018None of us found the National Loaf easy to digest. As flour was scarce, it was padded out with potato starch.\u2019 When the family entered the 1960s, Mr Robshaw said \u2018food became fun\u2019 thanks to the likes of fish fingers and \u2018it all felt extraordinarily liberating after the austerity of the 1950s\u2019. He added: \u2018It [the show] brought home to us all how British food has been revolutionised in an incredibly short time.\u2019 Throughout the series, in which the family saw not only their menus given an overhaul but also their wardrobes, kitchen and daily routine, they were helped by famous faces including Mary Berry and Hairy Biker Dave Myers.

But this broken brickwork is actually the result of a botched building job that brought the house down on a couple\u2019s plan for a basement extension. Ed Goldswain and his eight months pregnant fianc\u00e9e Jacquie Hale fled for their lives when the building cracked in half, escaping from their ground floor flat with their upstairs neighbours as debris fell \u2018like something out of a disaster movie\u2019. That was just the start of their nightmare. For although the builders were found by a judge to have been \u2018incompetent\u2019 and were ordered to pay \u00a3287,000 damages, the firm is believed to be insolvent, the High Court heard. And while the couple had buildings cover, the insurance company has so far refused to pay up. Now the pair fear they will never see their money \u2013 and they are still saddled with a 23-year mortgage on the \u00a3345,000 flat. Edward Goldswain and his partner Jacqueline Hale, who was eight months pregnant at the time, were planning to extend their \u00a3345,000 ground-floor flat into the basement of this property in Finchley, north London, when disaster struck . Mr Goldswain said AIMS Plumbing & Building Services Ltd were paid to do the work, but he and his partner soon noticed cracks appearing in the walls of the Edwardian home . After a bout of heavy rain Mr Goldswain said he noticed the cracks widening dramatically. The pair alerted their upstairs neighbour and all of them were forced to flee as the building fell down into the basement . Yesterday 39-year-old investment banker Miss Hale described how, in ten or 20 seconds, cracks in the wall went from 1cm wide to 10cm before one side of the building fell away. The trauma caused her early contractions and she had to be taken to hospital. The baby boy was born unharmed six weeks later. Miss Hale and marketing manager Mr Goldswain, 40, bought the house in Finchley, North London, four years ago and decided to extend into the basement. AIMS Plumbing & Building Services Limited began work in September 2012. It went wrong within two months and the couple sued. Last week Mr Justice Akenhead said the \u2018overwhelming probability\u2019 was that the builders failed to carry out the work with reasonable care and skill. Barnet council has demolished the building and made the site safe. And the couple \u2013 who now have a second son \u2013 have been renting as they contest the insurance company\u2019s decision. Miss Hale said: \u2018The good news is that we\u2019re happy and healthy and we\u2019ve got two lovely kids.\u2019 The judge ordered AIMS Plumbing & Building Services Limited to pay the couple almost \u00a3290,000 for the destruction of their Edwardian home. Mr Goldswain and Ms Hale were forced to move out of their dream property, along with their neighbour, and subsequent checks by Finchley Council revealed the house would have to be pulled down . Broken home: Workers dismantle the property in north London after the botched basement extension. A judge today ruled that it was the builders' 'incompetence' which led to the collapse . In tatters:The builders were ordered to pay \u00a3290,000 in compensation to Mr Goldswain and Ms Hale, but the couple were told they may not see a penny because the firm has gone bust . All gone: The couple were forced to live a nomadic existence after the house was taken down (pictured), moving through a string of temporary homes, but have now settled in Harpenden . There is now nothing more than a hole where their old house used to be, with supporting beams used to keep the neighbouring properties up . Edward Goldswain and his partner Jacqueline Hale, who was eight months pregnant at the time, had to run from their flat as the house collapsed . But the court heard AIMS is 'believed to be insolvent', so the couple may well never see any of the money. Describing it as 'a sad case', the judge said the couple bought a lease of the ground floor of 4 Stanhope Avenue in 2011. They needed more space for their growing family and decided to extend into the basement, AIMS starting work in September 2012. However, it all went horribly wrong on November 24 2012 after a heavy rain storm, said the judge. Cracks which the couple had already noticed began to widen fast and 'they could actually hear the fabric of the house tearing apart'. The couple and the upstairs tenant, who had a baby, hastily evacuated and watched as the building crumbled. 'Deeply shocked', Mr Goldswain and Miss Hale escaped with little more than the clothes they stood up in, the court heard. They watched as the flank wall first ballooned outwards before collapsing in on itself. The next door house was also badly damaged. Heavily pregnant Miss Hale went into premature labour due to the trauma, although her baby was happily delivered unharmed. The council took emergency steps to shore-up what remained of the building and it has remained derelict ever since. Since the destruction of their home, the couple have led a nomadic existence, moving between temporary homes, but have now settled in Harpenden. And they suffered yet another blow when they discovered that the loss was not covered by their home insurance. They now face paying off the remaining 23 years of the mortgage, while dealing with the heart-breaking loss of their house, according to the Evening Standard. The couple's lawyers argued that AIMS was 'completely out of its depth' and 'not competent to do the job which it had been employed to do'. And the judge ruled: 'The overwhelming probability is that AIMS failed to carry out their work with reasonable care and skill'. 'The firm had taken no effective steps to to prop up the flank wall or to lay a concrete floor slab which could have averted disaster.' However, the judge said AIMS had 'played no part' in the case and was believed to be insolvent. The couple also sued engineering firm, Beltec Limited, who designed the essential structure of the basement extension. However, whilst expressing 'the greatest sympathy' for the couple, the judge ruled that the company had not been negligent and bore no responsibility for the disaster. AIMS was ordered to pay \u00a3287,754 damages - although the couple are likely to face an uphill struggle in getting hold of any of that. Denying claims they opted for the cheapest service on offer, Miss Hale said she considered quotes from a number of builders before selecting AIMS. She and Mr Goldswain checked references and chose a firm that said it had carried out basement extensions in the past. She added: \u2018The builder did have insurance, which I made him get, and checked before he started. I also called the company to make sure he had it. But they also declined to cover him.\u2019 Some neighbouring houses were damaged by the collapse, including one that the wall fell against. Some of those neighbours\u2019 sued the couple. \u2018They will be paid,\u2019 Miss Hale said.

A 15-year-old schoolboy was knocked down and killed by a police car while walking home from  church with his younger brother. Harry Kirkham was run over by an officer on a routine patrol as he crossed the road\u00a0outside Erdington Police Station in Birmingham. The teenager suffered a heart attack and was rushed to hospital but died the next day. Harry had been making his way home with his 13-year-old brother after attending a service at the nearby Potter's House Christian Fellowship Church when he was mowed down at 9pm on Wednesday. The officer, from Sutton Coldfield police station, gave the youngster first aid along with a passing paramedic who witnessed the crash. Police said he has been left 'traumatised' by the ordeal but has been questioned by detectives from the force's Professional Standards Department. A local resident,\u00a0who saw the aftermath of the incident, but did not want to be named, added: 'There were blue flashing lights all along the road. 'I saw one young lad being comforted by a police officer - he looks in absolute shock. He was in floods of tears. 'I couldn't see much else apart from blankets and a stretcher and lots of emergency services. I didn't get too close though, you don't want to be disrespectful. 'Its a busy road and a lot of people bomb up and down it - but you don't expect a police officer to, especially if he isn't attending an emergency. It's an absolute tragedy.' Harry, from Kingstanding, Birmingham, suffered a cardiac arrested and was rushed to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital. West Midlands Police confirmed the teenager tragically died as a result of his injuries yesterday afternoon. The 15-year-old schoolboy  was knocked down by a police car on a routine patrol as he crossed New Sutton Road in Erdington, Birmingham as he walked home from a church service . Tributes have been left at the scene to the teenager who went into cardiac arrest after he was hit by a police officer's car- he died in hospital the next day . Pastor Lewis Claxton from the Potter's House Church added: 'He was running across the road probably. He wasn't playing a game or anything like that. 'Just beforehand, his brother Max told me that they were just going to the shops so they were on the way there at the time. 'I think he just did not use the crossing and thought he could just rush across the road when tragedy struck.' Chief Inspector Neil Hobson said: 'No parent should have to lose a child, particularly in such tragic circumstances. 'Our thoughts are with Harry's family following their tragic loss. 'As Harry was hit by a police car West Midlands Police has informed the Independent Police Complaints Commission who continue to be updated. 'We have launched an investigation to understand what happened last night and to provide answers. Hundreds of tributes have poured into the teen online and friends and family left messages at the scene including this touching tribute which read: 'To Harry, RIP, you are at peace now. My thoughts are with you and your family. You will be missed at church. From Ismail, Freda and family'. Another simply read: 'Rest in peace Harry-James, with love Faragher family xxxx' 'The police officer who was driving the car at the time has been left traumatised by the ordeal but is providing every assistance to the investigation.' The officer was on routine patrol in the area and was not responding to an emergency call when he struck Harry. A relative who answered the door at the family's semi-detached home yesterday morning said his parents had been left 'heartbroken'. He added: 'The family are too upset to talk. They are still at the hospital now. 'They are devastated and completely heartbroken.' Pastor  Claxton, 25, said Harry and his brothers had attended their services for the last three weeks. Speaking outside the church today he added: 'I was standing at the door of the church when I heard what seemed to sound like a car crash or a collision.

A new bar opens today in an old abandoned air raid shelter from World War Two and it has been designed to resemble a vintage Underground station. Based in Carnaby Street, Cahoots, will transport guests back to the 1940s, in a bid to bring Soho\u2019s illicit and nocturnal escapades from the era back to life. Scroll down for video . Enjoy being able to drink on the tube! Cahoot is a 1940s themed bar opening in Soho, and transports guests back to the period, with an old tube carriage for seating, sandbags and classic cocktails . Club owners Charlie Gilkes and Duncan Stirling tried to keep the bar as authentic to how the underground would have been in the 1940s, complete with the a wooden staircase entrance in homage to the old wooden escalators . From quirky cocktails served in clocks, to the authentic vintage signs, the centrally-located bar is the brainchild of Charlie Gilkes, 30, and Duncan Stirling, 33. The pair are owners of the Bunga Bunga bar and Maggie\u2019s nightclub, which is inspired by Margaret Thatcher and thought that as the Soho venue was used in the war as an air raid shelter, it would prove to be a poignant spot to host the bar. Charlie Gilkes of Inception Group said: 'We decided to open Cahoots, after having been inspired by true events that occurred in post-war Britain, and the venue's own extraordinary heritage. 'The site was formerly Tatty Bogle, an out-of-hours drinking club, first opened in 1917 by a group of Scottish officers. 'It was also used as a bomb shelter during World War II and the wartime membership book contains names such as Burgess, Maclean, Anthony Blunt and Buster Crabbe. With Cahoots we loved the idea of bringing the history of the place back to our visitors.' First timers are greeted by the station master, in character, at the entry kiosk and issued a \u2018day ticket\u2019 to enter the underground station . During the war a number of disused underground stations were used for shelter and inhabitants would bring their own nick-nicks and furnishings to feel at home during the raids. To bring Cahoots to life, the pair recreated the vintage tube carriage using real London Underground fabrics, and leather from the period. They also aimed to make the entrance as authentic as possible to the wooden escalators that would have been used in the stations. If the decor is not enough to inspire a visit, the extensive cocktail menu is an impressive eight pages long and vast amount on offer are priced \u00a37-\u00a39. Chose to indulge in Dig for Victory-style cocktails, drinks served in Thermos flasks, milk bottles, as well as new variations of old\u00a0favourites. Alternatively the impressive Cahoots signature cocktail is the Tanqueray No.TEN Station Clock, which has a working face, and serves eight for \u00a3150. Bottoms up! You are spoilt for choice at Cahoots with eight pages of cocktails including the Give Peas a Chance (\u00a310). \u00a0Inspired by gimlets, it is made from  Goose Original vodka, garden peas, lime juice, basil, agave syrup, and a Mo\u00ebt & Chandon Brut Imp\u00e9rial NV champagne foam . When you arrive at the Soho location, you are greeted by staff who issue you with a ticket to board the underground tube carriage . Even the staff are dressed in character, with 1946 outfits, accents, nicknames with\u00a0back stories\u00a0as to how they came to work in the bar. Another interesting feature about the bar is the dimly-lit cosy air raid bunker seating booth, which is perfect for dates due to the snug proximity. The surroundings will be brought to life by 1940s- style singer and musicians, with possible cabaret events being put on in the near future. Cahoots is opening today in Kingly Court, W1, opens on Thursday 5 March, with free entry, and opportunities to reserve tables via the website. As well as serving classic cocktails, black market liquor and post-war favourites are also available, in particular rum and gin based drinks are furtively knocked back from old mugs, hip flasks, vintage milk bottles and tins . Those in groups are able to pass time with the Cahoots signature sharer cocktail, \u2018The Tanqueray No. TEN Station Clock\u2019, served in an actual clock with a working clock face . The cocktail list features Dig-for-victory drinks, which fit perfectly in with 1940s theme of the bar, which includes bunting, sandbags and fabric used for old underground tubes . Cahoots is located on the former site of Tatty Bogle, an out-of-hours drinking club, first opened in 1917 by a group of Scottish officers. It was used as a bomb shelter during World War II . During the war, several disused underground stations were turned into air raid shelters and Londoners would transform the spaces into a \u2018home away from home\u2019, with their own nick-nacks and furnishings .

Abdulbaki Todashev, father of then-27-year-old Ibragim Todashev, said he will file a notice of claim in the death of his son, who was shot by Special Agent Aaron McFarlane the night of May 21, 2013. The claim will lead to a wrongful death lawsuit, and the elder Todashev is also alleging negligence by the FBI for hiring McFarlane, who had a checkered past. Scroll down for video . Warning: graphic image below . Ibragim Todashev, 27, was shot by FBI agent Aaron McFarlane during investigations into the Boston bombings. His father Abdulbaki  has filed a notice of claim alleging wrongful death . Todashev (left) was repeatedly questioned by federal agents in the aftermath of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings. Abdulbaki Todashev (right) has previously said that 'FBI bandits' killed his son . The agent settled two police brutality lawsuits while at the Oakland Police Department and allegedly falsified reports before joining Boston's FBI, according to the\u00a0Boston Globe. Todashev is represented by the Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations, who says that his son 'did not pose a threat of serious bodily harm to McFarlane or any other person' while being questioned about the Boston Bombings and a 2011 murder. The Department of Justice and a Florida\u00a0State Attorney\u2019s Office\u00a0have both cleared McFarlane of wrongdoing in the shooting at Ibragim Todashev's Orlando apartment. Both official reports said that the agent acted in self-defense after being attacked by Todashev, a trained martial arts fighter. The Russian immigrant, who lived in Massachusetts before moving to Florida, was reportedly writing a confession for involvement in the 2011 killing of three drug dealers in Waltham, a suburb of Boston, when he threw a coffee table and lunged at McFarlane with a broom. FBI agent McFarlane and two Massachusetts state troopers were interrogating Todashev for six hours before he was shot. The Chechen Orlando resident had reportedly been writing a confession linked to a murder case . Todashev was friends with Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev (left) after training with him. Tamerlan, \u00a026, was killed shortly after the 2013 attack, and his brother Dzhokar, (right, then 19) is now on trial . He was shot seven times in two bursts of fire, including once on the top of the head. Abdulbaki Todashev, in Moscow, says that the agent killed his son 'in cold blood,' according to MSNBC. He has previously said that 'FBI bandits' had been behind the death. Two Massachusetts state troopers were also present and CAIR Florida  says that 'none of the agents present sought to intervene to prevent the excessive force, though able.' Lawyers for the group also say that McFarlane allegedly falsified police reports and was misusing government money by working for the FBI while accepting disability payments from California. Abdulbaki Todashev also alleges negligence in the FBI's hiring of McFarlane . A statement from the Todashev family, who buried Ibragim in Chechnya, Russia, said they want to 'draw public attention to the illegal practices, abuses of power, and civil rights violations by the FBI. FBI internal investigations cleared every officer in 150 shootings since 1993, according to a 2013 investigation by the New York Times. CAIR also faults the agency for 'allowing of agents to conduct potentially charged interviews in people's homes'. Ibragim Todashev was approached by FBI almost immediately following the Boston bombings, and had questioned him repeatedly and confiscated his electronic devices before the shooting. The six-hour Orlando interrogation occurred in the aftermath of the 2013 Boston bombings, where Todashev's friend Tamerlan Tsarnaev, then 26, is thought to have killed three and injured more than 200 with homemade explosives. Tsarnaev, 26, was killed in the manhunt that followed the attack. His friend Todashev, who had trained at the same boxing gym as the attacker, told agents that the bombings were 'horrible and unnecessary,' according to the claim of notice. The episode that led to his death happened after the man's girlfriend had been taken to an immigration detention center after allegedly refusing FBI agents' request to inform them of his activities. The claim of Abdulbaki Todahsev (left) against the FBI is being handled by the Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations's Florida office, including CAIR Tampa executive director Hassan Shibly (center) A witness Todashev had brought to his interrogation was allegedly sent away shortly before his friend was shot. A spokesman for the Boston FBI told Daily Mail Online that the agency does not comment on pending litigation. The national FBI office also declined comment on the same grounds and referred to the Department of Justice and Florida reports on the incident. Tsarnaev's younger brother Dzhokar, 19 at the time, is on trial for terrorism charges in connection with the Boston Bombings. Opening statements in the case will begin later this week.

He said: 'There is a dream-like euphoria mixed with a pinch-me feeling of disbelief throughout the country, given the Black Caps' success in winning their way through to Melbourne and Sunday's final has finally smashed that World Cup glass ceiling by banishing all the years of semi-final heartaches.

Fleming, who played 111 Tests and 280 one-day internationals, knows their supporters will be outnumbered, whoever triumphs in the second semi-final, but hopes they can reproduce the form that has got them this far. 'It will be a tough one to negotiate,' he added. 'Either way, New Zealand will know they will face a crowd in which their own supporters will be in the minority by quite some margin. 'I am not sure it matters who McCullum's men end up playing because either opponent at this stage of the tournament will be top-notch.

The current run of 1000 Colour (pieces pictured) is the second edition of the puzzle. It first went on sale last year, and the firm said it is working on producing a third . It had previously been thought the human eye couldn't see infrared light. However, researchers have revealed that under certain conditions, the retina can sense infrared light after all. An international team of researchers used cells from the retinas of mice and people. By firing powerful lasers that emit pulses of infrared light, the researchers found that  light-sensing cells in the retina sometimes get a double hit of infrared energy. When that happens, the eye is able to detect light that falls outside the visible spectrum. 'There is a real logic in doing that. It is weirdly soothing and therapeutic.

It's become a familiar story: Young people give up their futures in Western democratic nations to join the terrorist network establishing a self-declared Islamic state in the Middle East. Last month, three teenage British girls suspected of wanting to join ISIS may have gone to Syria, authorities said. Their fates remain unknown. An estimated 3,400 Westerners have gone to join ISIS in its bloody quest to establish an Islamist state in Iraq and Syria, said Nicholas Rasmussen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center. Analysts and U.S. officials agree: ISIS is skilled at luring Westerners, attracting far greater numbers than al Qaeda.  How is it doing this? ISIS recruits are often young -- sometimes disillusioned teenagers trying to find purpose and make their mark. \"The general picture provided by foreign fighters of their lives in Syria suggests camaraderie, good morale and purposeful activity, all mixed in with a sense of understated heroism, designed to attract their friends as well as to boost their own self-esteem,\" counterterrorism expert Richard Barrett wrote last year in a report called \"Foreign fighters in Syria.\" Fawaz Gerges, professor of Middle East studies at The London School of Economics, put it more bluntly: . \"ISIS provides these deluded young men and women with an adventurous trip.\" Many recruits come from educated, well-to-do backgrounds, like 25-year-old Abu Anwar of Britain. He said he had no problem leaving a comfortable lifestyle to join ISIS. \"I'm from the south of England. I grew up in a middle-class family,\" he told CNN. \"Life was easy back home. I had a life. I had a car. But the thing is, you cannot practice Islam back home. We see all around us evil. We see pedophiles. We see homosexuality. We see crime. We see rape.\" The names: Who has been recruited to ISIS from the West . Some are lured by the possibility of dying as a martyr so they can enjoy a sumptuous afterlife. Others may succumb to more tangible promises. ISIS loyalists are told they will receive gifts from Allah, wrote Aqsa Mahmood, a young British woman who left Scotland to join ISIS and now is an ISIS recruiter. Such gifts include \"a house with free electricity and water provided to you due to the Khilafah (the caliphate or state) and no rent included,\" Mahmood wrote. ISIS' slick propaganda videos resemble trailers for Hollywood action movies. One hourlong video showed a collection of bombings, executions, kidnappings and beheadings. As one roadside bomb blasts a vehicle into the sky, two men in the background of the video chuckle. ISIS now has the most sophisticated propaganda machine of any terrorist organization, said Matthew Olsen, former director of the National Counterterrorism Center. \"It turns out timely, high-quality media, and it uses social media to secure a widespread following,\" he said. Even the U.S. State Department admits ISIS' propaganda prowess \"is something we have not seen before.\" \"It's something we need to do a lot more work on,\" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said last month. \"We are seeing 90,000, I think, tweets a day that we're combating.\" \"We are way behind. They are far superior and advanced than we are when it comes to new media technologies,\" Maajid Nawaz, a former jihadi and author of \"Radical: My Journey out of Islamist Extremism,\" told CNN last year.  \"... It is very attractive for angry young Muslims when they see these sorts of videos and they hear language that resonates with them.\" The slick strategy offers a big edge over al Qaeda.  ISIS \"has proven far more adept than core al Qaeda -- or any of al Qaeda's affiliates -- at using new media tools to reach a broader audience,\" Rasmussen said. Recruits are also being lured by ISIS' success in its endeavor to create an Islamic state, analysts say. The intelligence community determined that ISIS' battlefield successes gave it \"some recruitment success,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in September. \"Militant groups across the Muslim world see the success ISIS has had so far in Syria and Iraq and opt to join it -- often leaving behind organizations plagued by infighting,\" CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen wrote in a CNN.com column. \"This is a political cult using religion and a perversion of Islam as the shield,\" said Steve Hassan,  founder of Freedom of Mind, a group dedicated to exposing destructive cults and cult behavior. \"But in fact, it's a systematic effort to create an army of basically tranced-out followers.\" That type of brainwashing is what turned Canadian Damian Clairmont into an ISIS militant, said his mother, Christianne Boudreau. \"It's so easy for them to get to our children, to access our children,\" she said. Clairmont died fighting in Syria last year. While ISIS' recruiting success gets a lot of attention, it is hardly drawing a huge percentage of young Westerners. About 130 Canadian citizens have traveled to the Middle East to join ISIS, Canada's intelligence agency estimated last year. About 1,200 French fighters have joined ISIS as well.  Roughly 600 British nationals are believed to have gone to Iraq and Syria, according to research groups, along with another 600 from Germany. In the United States, National Intelligence Director James Clapper has said 180 Americans have tried to go to fight in Syria. But it's unclear how many of those were attempting to join ISIS. Once foreigners go to Iraq or Syria to join ISIS, their odds of going back to their families can be slim. Video clips of foreign jihadists burning their passports show that many have no interest in returning home. Western leaders acknowledge there's work to do. \"It needs every school, every university, every college, every community to recognize they have a role to play, we all have a role to play in stopping people from having their minds poisoned by this appalling death cult,\" British Prime Minister David Cameron said last year. The U.S. government is trying to step up its efforts to counter ISIS propaganda by beefing up a small State Department agency to make it the heart of the fight against the militants' messaging. \"We're seeing their approaches continue to evolve,\" Psaki, the State Department spokeswoman, told CNN. \"We need to continue to make sure ours are evolving and we're combating it in the most strategic way and using every interagency resource.\" But she acknowledged that the United States still has a lot to do. \"We're really going to pick it up now,\" Psaki said. \"We have new people in charge of the office. And we will see what happens over the coming months.\" Several anti-ISIS efforts are already in place. Some European countries have laws that penalize membership in groups such as ISIS, said Barrett, the counterterrorism expert. And U.S. State Department official Richard Stengel said an anti-ISIS messaging campaign has helped prevent youths from joining. \"They're reading the messages, they're hearing the messages -- not just from us but from the hundreds of Islamic clerics who have said that this is a perversion of Islam, from the hundreds of Islamic scholars who have said the same thing,\" Stengel said in October. But Barrett said some officials might not be doing as much as they think. \"Policymakers often underestimate the impact of what is happening in these closed circles even as they overestimate the impact of their own.\" CNN's Josh Levs, Joshua Berlinger, Paula Newton, Jethro Mullen, Catherine E. Shoichet, Mariano Castillo, Laura Koran and Elise Labott contributed to this report.", "reference": "ISIS has a penchant for producing slick videos that resemble trailers for Hollywood action movies .\nAnalyst: Many recruits lack a sense of belonging; some want a lavish afterlife by dying as a \"martyr\"\nHundreds from the UK, Canada, France and the U.S. are suspected of going to join ISIS ."}, "138": {"id": "2a36fa6a84dc2ad75184271b45592c3cfc7a10c1", "article": "The BBC has announced record-breaking viewing figures for Saturday's gripping RBS 6 Nations finale between England and France at Twickenham.

Here,\u00a0Sportsmail gathers the best 10 quotes from our Sturridge interview. Daniel Sturridge tells Sportsmail his thoughts on Mario Balotelli, Steven Gerrard and his injury problems . Sturridge on Mario Balotelli . 'In football you meet people who are cool guys and he is one of those guys. He is a young guy who just wants to live his life. Anyone at the age of 24, if you put a microscope on them for a few months and see how they are living, it would probably be far worse than Mario. He is a normal guy. Footballers are put on a pedestal of not being human but we are just normal people. I am a normal dude.' Mario Balotelli (left) has been described as a 'cool guy' by Sturridge, despite a difficult start at his new club . Sturridge on Steven Gerrard . 'This guy is a living legend. Words can't describe what he has done not just for the club but for the players as well. He helps players settle in, young players. He takes them under his wing. We will never be able to repay him for that. His stature and his demeanour will be very difficult to replace but we have to. It will take time. That guy will always be a legend in my eyes. I am in awe of him now.' Sturridge (right) has hailed departing Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard (centre) as a 'living legend' of the club . Sturridge on strikers . 'Why am I watching someone else's glories and achievements? It doesn't matter to me who comes around or what players are about. It means nothing to me. When you watch other people, you don't get anywhere in life because you are at war with yourself. Well done to Harry Kane and what he has achieved, but I am not watching what he is doing. I just believe in me.' Harry Kane has had a scintillating  season at Tottenham scoring 26 goals in all competitions so far . Sturridge on England injury . 'Regardless of what happened in the past, I love playing for England,\u2019 says Sturridge. \u2018That situation occurred and it\u2019s in the past. I don\u2019t want to dwell on it. People pick injuries up and they are unfortunate. It just so happened I got injured that day. It\u2019s life. People get injured sometimes. It is what it is.' Sturridge's five-month injury lay-off began when he damaged thigh muscles while on England duty last year . Sturridge on Roy Hodgson . \u2018My relationship with the England manager is top class. No worries at all. We speak via text. We speak to each other. We keep in touch. Throughout my injury, he kept in touch. I would never blame him for this. Never. Or any of the staff - it was just an unfortunate incident. I have got so much respect and admiration for him and his set-up. The relationship is very, very good.' Despite the injury, Sturridge (right) says his relationship with England manager Roy Hodgson as 'top class' Sturridge on his personal life . 'I'm a very closed-off person,' says Sturridge. 'I can count my friends on one hand. Everyone has acquaintances, workmates and so on, but apart from that, I just have my family and a close-knit group of people around me. 'Why closed-off? I think it is down to childhood. When you grow up in certain environments, you can't be too loud or too open because you can be exposed to things you don't want to be exposed to. Where I grew up there was crime and there were other things.' Despite his extrovert celebration, the 25-year-old striker describes himself as a 'very closed-off person' Sturridge on Birmingham gang culture . 'There was a gang culture when I was growing up in Birmingham. It was easy to stay away from it because the football was there but that\u2019s the reason why I have never been open. 'It becomes second nature to be like that. I had to be wary. At all times. 'The gang stuff wasn\u2019t based on colours - it was more about areas. You might be a family friend of someone who was involved with something. I was never involved in anything like that and I enjoyed growing up there.' Sturridge on faith . 'I am grateful to God for everything that I have had in the past and everything I will have in the future,' he says. 'You have setbacks, you have comebacks, you have glories, you don't have glories. Not everything is going to be rosy and sweet all the time. There are going to be times in your life when you go through certain situations that test your character, test your courage, test your faith, test your self-belief, test everything.' Sturridge grew up in Hockley in the inner city Birmingham where he kept to himself to himself as a child . Sturridge on USA injury rehabilitation routine . 'I am getting up at 7am and I am finishing at 4 or 5pm. I\u2019m tired. It\u2019s dark by then. The sun\u2019s not out. I went back to my room, ate. Then I played some dominoes and went to bed.'

But the father of three told his wife he couldn't stay by 8-year-old Martin's side. The boy's body was torn apart by an explosion near the finish line of the Boston Marathon. His skin had changed color. A crowd hovered over him, frantically trying to help, but he was dying. Speaking from the witness stand at Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's trial on Thursday, Richard told jurors he was faced with a heartbreaking choice. \"I knew in my head that I needed to act quickly, or we might not only lose Martin,\" he said. \"We might lose Jane, too.\" Moments after the blast, Richard had stumbled toward Jane, his 7-year-old daughter. His pants and sneakers were torn apart. His legs felt like they were on fire. He could barely hear. And the air smelled \"vile,\" he said, like gunpowder, sulfur and burned hair. But he soon realized the situation was much worse for his daughter. \"She tried to get up and she fell. That was when I noticed her leg,\" he said. \"She didn't have it. It was blown off.\" So Richard left one son to die near the marathon finish line, and shielded his other son's eyes from the carnage as they raced to the hospital, hoping that doctors could save his daughter's life. \"It was,\" Richard said Thursday, \"the last time I saw my son alive -- barely.\" Richard's description of the explosion's horrifying aftermath capped a day of dramatic testimony as survivors shared their stories in the second day of the high-profile trial. Tsarnaev's attorneys admit that he carried out the 2013 attacks, which killed three people and injured more than 260 others at the marathon. A fourth person, an MIT police officer, was ambushed and killed in his patrol car three days after the bombings as Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, allegedly ran from police. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed after a gunbattle with police. And now, his younger brother sits in court facing 30 federal charges related to the bombings. His attorneys say he was influenced by his slain brother to participate in the attacks. They argued Thursday that now isn't the right time for jurors to hear the string of harrowing stories from survivors of the explosions, arguing that testimony should be part of a later phase of the trial, when jurors will decide what penalty Tsarnaev should face. But the judge sided with prosecutors, who argued the testimony was necessary to support their indictment. On Thursday, jurors relived the moments after the marathon bombings through the eyes of some of the people most affected by the blasts. Defense attorneys didn't ask them any questions. Jeff Bauman was suspicious as soon as he noticed a black backpack on the ground near the finish line. \"I thought it was weird,\" he said Thursday. \"If you are at the airport, if you see any unattended luggage, you notify authorities.\" But this was Boston, he thought, where stuff like that doesn't happen. Still, he told a friend they should move. An explosion came two seconds later. \"I saw a flash, heard like three pops and I was on the ground,\" Bauman said from the witness stand Thursday. \"At first I opened my eyes and saw the sky. The first thought was, that was a big firework.\" Bauman's ears were ringing, and everything was muffled, but he heard the screams. The first bomb had exploded. \"I looked down and saw my legs, and it was pure carnage,\" he told jurors. \"I could see my bone.\" Bauman testified about becoming aware of his injuries -- burns, wounds on his back, and his legs. \"I knew my legs were gone. I know that instantly,\" he said. He kept repeating to himself, \"This is messed up, this is messed up, this is messed up.\" Then the second explosion. \"We are under attack,\" he thought to himself. All he wanted to do was call his mom. When Boston Police Officer Lauren Woods saw people running by, screaming, she ran against the grain, toward Boylston Street, the last leg on the marathon route. One of the first victims Woods came across was Lu Lingzi, a graduate student at Boston University. Lu was vomiting profusely, Woods recalled Thursday. Others were already performing CPR on her, and the officer attempted to clear Lu's airway. \"I smelled the residue of smoke,\" Woods said. \"Smelled like fireworks, cannons.\" Paramedics arrived, and eventually told Woods the young woman was not going to make it and they had to move on to other people. Lu became one of the three fatalities at the scene. It smelled like gunpowder, Alan Hern told the jury, and \"kind of felt like we were underwater.\" Hern's wife -- who was pregnant -- was running the race. He found her uninjured, but hysterical from the explosions and ensuing chaos, he said. There were powder marks on her jacket. Hern, a high school football coach, then went searching for his 11-year-old son, Aaron. A figure covered in black soot and hair standing straight up caught Hern's eye, and he knew it was Aaron, he testified. His son's left thigh was cratered, mangled flesh and blood, Hern said. \"It was like something you'd see in a war movie,\" he said. \"His eyebrows were singed and his hair was sticking straight up.\" Another of Thursday's witnesses, Roseann Sdoia, also referred to it as something out of a movie. Before she hit the ground from the blast, she said, it registered in her mind that she had lost her leg. \"When I looked down, my leg was tucked under me, but blood was pouring out,\" she told jurors. In front of her lay a socked foot. She started thinking -- Did I wear socks today? She decided she hadn't worn socks that day. It was someone else's foot. \"It was almost like I was starring in a horror movie,\" she said, \"as was everybody else around me.\" Doctors had to amputate her leg below the knee. Traveling from the marathon finish line to the hospital, Bill Richard went from one terrifying scene to another. \"You know it's not going to be good when you see the look of horror on doctors' faces,\" he told the court Thursday. \"Jane was devastatingly injured.\" Doctors amputated her left leg below the knee and removed more than 20 shrapnel pieces from her body, he said. Richard soon learned that, as he'd feared, Martin didn't survive the bombing. His wife, Denise, was also hospitalized after the attack. She lost sight in one eye. The father said his own injuries were much less severe than the wounds many other victims suffered. The ringing in his ears never stops, and he lost some of his hearing. But Richard said he could still hear the lawyer questioning him at Thursday's trial. He can still hear music. And the most important thing. \"I can still hear,\" he said, \"the beautiful voices of my family.\"\u200b . CNN's Ann O'Neill reported from Boston. Mariano Castillo and Catherine E.

The Ministry or Defence said that the\u00a0stealth F35-B, which has been plagued by design flaws and technical setbacks, could not be flown\u00a0within 28 miles of a thunderstorm. Named\u00a0\u2018Lightning II\u2019, it was even at risk of its namesake while on the ground with pilots told to move it under cover if less than 11 miles away from a storm. RAF pilots have been banned from flying Lightning II fighter jets in a storm over fears it could explode . The fighter was created under  the U.S. 20-year Joint Strike Fighter programme, with the U.S. Government having ordered 2,500 of the Lockheed Martin planes. In Britain, 14 of the aircraft have been ordered to replace the ageing Harrier jump jet on the decks of the new Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers. But a recent Pentagon report highlighted concerns over the placement of the jet's fuel tanks, which are located all the way through the wing, through the fuselage, around the inlets and back toward the engine. Pierre Sprey, a former Pentagon analyst who helped design the F-16 in the early 1970s, compared the engine to 'a blowtorch surrounded by fuel.' There was also a risk of catching fire if the fighter plane was shot at. Last June, an\u00a0F-35 burst into flames as it was taxiing for\u00a0take-off\u00a0at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida,\u00a0because the engine had cracked during previous flights\u00a0manoeuvres. One of the Pratt & Whitney engines broke apart, pushed through the top of the aeroplane, and caught fire while the pilot was preparing to take off. The entire fleet of F-35s was grounded for three weeks, and the plane missed its international debut. But that was not the end of problems for the fighter jets. The single-seat, single-engine fighter aircraft boasts a helmet mounted display system which is supposed to offer\u00a0a 360 degree view of the outside of the aircraft.\u00a0But the MoD admitted there were still 'unresolved issues' surrounding the technology. The Ministry or Defence said that the stealth F35-B, which has been plagued by design flaws and technical setbacks, could not be flown within 28 miles of a thunderstorm in case it was hit by lightning . SNP defence spokesman Angus Robertson, who brought up the safety issue in a series of parliamentary questions, told the Mirror the MoD were 'burying its head in the sand' over the jet's failures. He said: 'When they named the aircraft Lightning I don't think they expected that very thing would render them totally useless. Adding to this \u00adembarrassment is the revelation none of these new jets have yet broken the sound barrier.' The RAF website states that the Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter was built to be a 'multi-role, all weather, day and night aircraft'. Planes have a top speed of 1,300mph, a range of 1,450 miles and can carry a range of weapons including air-to-air rockets and satellite guided bombs. The design also uses stealth technology which will allow pilots to minimise its radar signature.", "reference": "The MoD has banned pilots flying \u00a3100m Lightning fighter jets in storms .\nMove comes over fears lightning bolt could bring the stealth aircraft down .\nRAF has ordered 14 of the new jets to be phased in over next five years .\nFighter was created in the U.S. 20-year Joint Strike Fighter programme .\nThe U.S has ordered 2,500 of the new Lockheed Martin aeroplanes .\nBut stealth F35-B was plagued by design flaws and technical setbacks .\nPilots were warned it could not be flown within 28 miles of thunderstorm ."}, "147": {"id": "acdf5c179770ff6de7eedefae41d4aaf9620a725", "article": "A Swedish football team has told of how they narrowly escaped death after a last-minute decision against booking their players on Germanwings Flight 4U9525.

Lucky escape: Swedish Division 1 team\u00a0Dalkurd FF had initially planned to travel on Flight 4U9525 to D\u00fcsseldorf, but instead split the team over the three remaining flights from Barcelona this morning . When the Dalkurd FF delegation of 29 players and staff landed, they found out that the fourth flight had crashed, and the passengers next to them at check in a few hours earlier had died. All 144 passengers, including two babies and 16 teenagers from a German high school, and six crew members lost their lives when Germanwings Flight 4U9525 crashed this morning. The Airbus A320 ploughed into the mountainside in a remote region of the French Alps en route from Spain to Germany\u00a0at more than 400mph. 'We were supposed to have been on that flight. We checked in with all of the passengers. It's surreal,' Dalkurd FF's sports chief Adil Kizil told Aftonbladet.

Let's just say we were very lucky.' Dalkurd FF, formed in 2004 by Kurdish immigrants, play in Sweden's Division 1,\u00a0the third level in the league system of Swedish football. The team had been on a week-long training camp in Barcelona and were flying home this morning, and were supposed to have been on Flight 9525. Mr Kizil told the newspaper how they had tried to fit the entire team on the Germanwings flight, but that the connection time in\u00a0D\u00fcsseldorf to continue their journey home to Sweden was too long. Instead they split the team onto the three other  flights, with one group flying via\u00a0M\u00fcnchen and two others via Z\u00fcrich.

But we are getting closer.\" Obama emphasized that a day of commemoration is not enough to repay the debt paid by the marchers who were brutally beaten 50 years ago as they demonstrated for voting rights. \"If Selma taught us anything, it's that our work is never done,\" the President said near Edmund Pettus Bridge, where the confrontation between authorities and marchers was captured in film and photographs that jolted the nation. Read President Obama's prepared remarks . The President said that what civil rights marchers did years ago \"will reverberate through the ages. Not because the change they won was preordained; not because their victory was complete; but because they proved that nonviolent change is possible; that love and hope can conquer hate.\" He hailed the marchers as heroes. The President said that \"the Americans who crossed this bridge, they were not physically imposing, but they gave courage to millions. They held no elected office. But they led a nation.\" The \"Bloody Sunday\" anniversary marks 50 years from the day hundreds of people were brutally attacked by Alabama state troopers as they marched from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, to protest racial discrimination in voter registration. About 600 people participated in the planned 50-mile journey on March 7, 1965. The marchers were protesting discrimination that kept black people from voting. But as the marchers approached the foot of the bridge, state troopers used force and tear gas to push them back. As events were underway Saturday in Selma, hundreds of people marched across the Brooklyn Bridge in New York to symbolize their unity with the Alabama commemoration. Television coverage of the event in 1965 triggered national outrage and eventually led Congress to pass the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965, which mandated federal oversight over elections in states with histories of discrimination. 50 years later: Memories from 'Bloody Sunday' nurse . Many of the nation's leaders, activists and celebrities were in Selma on Saturday attending various activities taking place in memory of the historic event. On Saturday, Rep. John Lewis -- one of the demonstrators bloodied by troopers 50 years ago -- and nearly 100 other members of Congress from both parties joined the President  at the bridge in Selma -- a bridge that still bears the name of Pettus, a Confederate general who was also a Ku Klux Klan leader. \"We must use this moment to recommit ourselves to do all we can to finish this work. There's still work to be done,\" said Lewis, adding this is an opportunity to \"redeem the soul of America.\" The President said that though progress has been made, racism is still too prevalent in America. \"We just need to open our eyes, and ears, and hearts, to know that this nation's racial history still casts its long shadow upon us,\" he said.  \"We know the march is not yet over, the race is not yet won, and that reaching that blessed destination where we are judged by the content of our character -- requires admitting as much.\" The President called on Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act, first passed in 1965. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a key provision of the law that required certain states with a history of racial discrimination at the polls to \"pre-clear\" any changes to the law with the federal government before implementing them. Efforts to revive key provisions of the act have stalled in Congress. John Lewis's memories of the march . Reflecting a sense of change in the half century since Bloody Sunday, and with Selma again in a national media spotlight, the mood in the crowd Saturday was of unity, and talks were focused on how to move America forward. But some current Selma residents worried that after the dignitaries leave their town -- with a population 82% black and with more than 40% of its people living below the national poverty level -- will fade from view except for its historical significance. Many black residents of Selma say they still live in a divisive society and still feel the sting of racism, with true change yet to come. Geraldine Martin, 59, has lived in Selma all her life. She was 9 years old on \"Bloody Sunday\" and with her mother had just welcomed a little sister, Belinda, to the world on that day. The two sisters grew up in Selma less than a decade apart. They graduated from Selma High School and both had to make decisions about whether to stay in their hometown when few opportunities existed for young people. \"We need to reevaluate our education system,\" said Geraldine, who became a special education teacher at Selma High.  \"We need incentives for young people. I am hoping today's events will help us move forward.\" Opinion: Selma's historic bridge deserves a better name . Belinda shook her head. She left Selma after high school and now lives in Atlanta. Her view of Selma has changed over the years -- looking in from the outside. \"I don't see how Selma will move forward without togetherness,\" said Belinda. \"There is no diversity in Selma. People don't live together. \"I want to ask white people: 'So why are you so angry at us? Is it really the color of my skin or something deeper?'\" Maybe, she said, the attention on Selma this weekend will help spark a relevant dialogue. 50 years later: The house where MLK stayed .

Frustrated with how long it is taking to get approval for its flying delivery service in the US, Amazon is said to have approached the British Government to launch a trial of the technology in Britain. Transport minister Robert Goodwill revealed the plans at a press conference for driverless cars and wider technologies earlier today. Amazon has approached the British Government about trialling its flying Amazon Prime Air service in the UK, transport minister Robert Goodwill has confirmed. One of its prototype delivery drones is pictured . \u2018I had some people from Amazon coming to see me the other day; they want to replace van deliveries with drone deliveries, and they can\u2019t do any trials in the US because they\u2019re over-regulated,\u2019 he said. \u2018So my favourite word is deregulation, and we need to make sure that wherever you are in the world, and if you want to innovate and you want to invest in this sort of technology, come to the UK because we\u2019re here to help you.' The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US last week approved Amazon\u2019s plan to begin testing drones for online deliveries, though the e-commerce firm first made the request in July last year. But in the time it took to approve the use of its first-generation drone,  Amazon has developed a new version, which makes the ruling 'obsolete'. So the firm is setting its sights on foreign markets. The project, called Amazon Prime Air, was first revealed in a YouTube video in late 2013. The company is developing drones that can fly at speeds of 50 miles per hour (80 kph), operate autonomously and sense and avoid objects. Amazon\u2019s Paul Misener wrote in a letter to the FAA in December: \u2018Without approval of our testing in the United States, we will be forced to continue expanding our Prime Air R&D footprint abroad.\u2019 Under US law, operating drones for commercial purposes is illegal, however it is allowed in the UK if permission is granted by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The FAA is said to be currently reviewing its rules on drones, with new regulations expected to be announced in the near future. Amazon is developing aerial vehicles as part of Amazon Prime Air. The aircraft can travel at more than 50mph and carry loads of up to 5 pounds (2kg). About 86 per cent of Amazon's deliveries are five lbs or less, the company said. 'We believe customers will love it, and we are committed to making Prime Air available to customers worldwide as soon as we are permitted to do so,' Amazon has said. In the US, the flying of unmanned aircraft, including recreational drones, is banned above 400ft (122m). Any flight that takes place within five miles (8km) of an airport can also only occur once air traffic control has been notified. The UK\u2019s CAA has laid out guidelines for drone users that specify that unmanned aircraft must always be flown within the \u2018line of sight\u2019 of the pilot, which it generally measures at 1,600ft (488m) horizontally and 400ft (122m) vertically. This remains a stumbling block for Amazon and other companies as it means they would only be able to deliver items within 1,600ft (488m) of their warehouses. So far, law enforcement of drone regulation breaches in the UK appear to have been relatively tolerant. Chief inspector Nick Aldworth, of the Metropolitan Police, told a House of Lords select committee on piloted aircraft systems that tourists had been caught flying drones in parts of central London, despite laws restricting use close to buildings and congested areas. \u2018We have decided not to enforce the legislation that exists, even though they were in contravention of it, because it did not seem proportionate,\u2019 he said. Chinese internet giant Alibaba is also currently carrying out its own private trials of drone technology for deliveries. A new website allows homeowners to register the sky above their property as a no fly zone for drones. 'NoFlyZoneUK.org is the first site in the UK to introduce the vast benefits which the drone industry will inevitably bring,' says John Tansley, its Managing Director. 'In fact the service is intended to benefit the public, the drone industry and the UK Government. 'Our hope is that in allowing the public to request that their property become a no fly zone, then this will address the privacy concerns which have been mooted by the relevant authorities.' A new website allows homeowners to register the sky above their property as a no fly zone for drones. An example of a map marking such zones is shown . The company will monitor and record drone traffic so its service can provide a 'rapid drone intercept solution' to prevent hostile incidents such as a terrorist attack. Mr Tansley, who has previously served in HM Forces and in the Metropolitan Police, believes the service will allow the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) industry to establish itself in the UK. 'As our database grows, it will help services such a Amazon\u2019s Prime Air, DHL\u2019s drone delivery service and Google\u2019s Project Wing among others realistically get a foothold in the UK while simultaneously addressing current security and privacy concerns,' he added. NoFlyZoneUK.org will be able to monitor and track all drone, UAV, Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) and Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) flights and share this information with the public.", "reference": "Transport minister Robert Goodwill\u00a0confirmed\u00a0Amazon asked for the trial .\nHe seemed to encourage the trials and innovation in Britain .\nAmazon Prime Air was first unveiled in 2013 with the idea that parcels could be delivered to remote areas by drones reaching 50mph (80km/h)"}, "151": {"id": "86f5ece5bc0b57e48e562a1e276e79047cd9f44d", "article": "Former England hardman Paul Ince\u00a0has picked his #one2eleven of stars he  played alongside throughout his career, on The Fantasy Football Club on Sky Sports.

Watch #one2eleven every Friday evening on The Fantasy Football Club, Sky Sports 1 or catch up On Demand. Paul Ince (centre) picks his best 11 he played with and included David Beckham (left) and Paul Gascoigne . GOALKEEPER: PETER SCHMEICHEL . Has to be 'Big Pete.' What a fantastic goalkeeper, I played with David Seaman and he was a very good goalkeeper but for me Schmeichel was another level. Just the fact that, one on one's, normally when somebody goes through on the goalkeeper you just pray that they're going to save it but you just knew Schmeichel was going to save it, so we'd always set up a counter-attack because we knew he would. He could also throw the ball as far as he could kick it and the amount of times we would get get corners against us, he'd pluck it and release it to Giggs and Kanchelskis and we'd score goals. Best goalkeeper in the world during his time. RIGHT BACK: JAVIER ZANETTI . He is a great player. Zanetti joined Inter Milan the same time as me and he was just awesome. He was just a young kid but he just slotted into the way we played. The reason I put him in ahead of Gary Neville is because Javier can play in different positions and I always want players who can be flexible and what ever position he played in - he was world class. He was unbelievable. CENTRAL DEFENDER: TONY ADAMS . Colossus. Proper centre half. Men-of-men. In our England team we were all men, we were all big characters and big men but he was men-of-men. He was a leader and he inspired people around him. People say he wasn't the best passer but he wasn't that bad. His volley against Everton showed he could play. He wasn't the quickest but his timing of tackling. He was a brilliant organiser, he's top draw. Peter Schmeichel was labelled as the best goalkeeper in the world by former team-mate Paul Ince . Gary Pallister (right) played with Ince at Manchester United and was picked in his Fantasy squad . CENTRAL DEFENDER: GARY PALLISTER . Very unlucky to not play for England more. Laziest man you'll ever meet in football, if you did running he'd be at the back, when you finished training he'd be the first out of the door. I used to go round his house and he'd be playing on his PlayStation eating Malteasers. But when it came to playing football you would never see anyone go past him, you'd never see anyone beat him and he had telescopic legs, he was quick and he could play. The only negative is that he should have scored more goals but what a player. LEFT BACK: ROBERTO CARLOS . When I first met him at Inter, I thought wow. Firstly, I couldn't believe how big his legs were, you can see that in the way he plays and strikes a ball. He had great pace up and down the line, he could tackle, score and he was an incredible player. The only thing that disappointed me was that Roy Hodgson let him go to Real Madrid a little bit early. RIGHT WING: DAVID BECKHAM . An easy decision. Becks was the true professional, he was probably the best technical player I played with. I used to watch him and watch him. As soon as we'd finished [training], the mannequins would be out and he'd be taking free-kicks, corners and he'd do it for an hour. Every training session he'd give 110 per cent, he would never beat anybody but if you give him a yard, he'll put in the best balls you'll ever see. What a player. Ince described Beckham as the best technical player he played with during his footballing career . MIDFIELDER: ROY KEANE . For a complete player, without a doubt Keano. Apart from the bad side he had, he was the complete midfield player for me. He was an inspiration, a leader, could score you vital goals, he could tackle when he had too, he would be naughty when he had too but playing alongside him for three or four seasons helped him improve my game a lot. MIDFIELDER: PAUL GASCOIGNE . Probably the best player I played with. What more can I say? He's a maverick, he just had everything. He wasn't the quickest but he had that little injection of pace to get away from people and I remember seeing Gazza play for the first time at Upton Park and he was telling Billy Bonds to keep up. He's brilliant, scores all types of goals and without doubt the best player I played alongside. Paul Gascoigne was highly praised by Ince and claims the former Newcastle man was the best he played with . LEFT WING: RYAN GIGGS . He would play 20 games and be unplayable, he was that good. If you're a full back and think get tight - then he'll spin inside, he you drop off then he will rip you apart. Outstanding player, what he's done in the game, his mindset when he played in centre midfielder for Manchester United for two or three years says it all. The best left winger there will ever be. STRIKER: ERIC CANTONA . Couldn't leave him out. When Cantona did come to United I knew that we'd win the title because he just had the aura and presence about him. He took the responsibility away from all of us lot. He was unbelievable, he'd come in at half past nine every morning, do his own warm-up and work on his skills, touch and his x, y and z. He was just brilliant. His goals and importance to the team make him an unbelievable player. STRIKER: ALAN SHEARER . When I think about a complete striker and what I'd want as a manager as my striker is Alan Shearer. It's not just the goals he scored, he was a handful, he could run the channels, his retention of the ball was fantastic and he was a leader of men. I don't think we'll have a striker in that mould again. Eric Cantona (left) and Alan Shearer are two of the best strikers the Premier League has seen .

The announcement is a move away from the firm's strategy to differentiate itself from Apple by allowing developers to immediately publish their mobile apps. But Google added that it will not be adopting Apple's practice of only approving apps that meet its stringent quality standards. Google is tightening supervision of its freewheeling Play store, forming a special team to screen new apps for malware and sexually explicit material, and strengthening its age-based rating system . The change underscores the growing importance of apps in the success of the companies' rival mobile gadgets. Google and Apple each manage online hubs with more than one million apps ranging from calendars to video games. Google said in its official blog today that its expert team will screen each app submitted by developers to spot earlier anything that runs afoul of its rules. The developer policies exclude sexually explicit material, 'gratuitous violence,' hate speech, gambling, 'dangerous products,' spam and infringement of intellectual property. The new age-rating system will see Android developers filling in a questionnaire about their app or game instead of simply choosing a rating . Google had only used automated technology for screening at the time of submission. The new process will not create bottlenecks, Google said, promising that approved apps will become available on Google Play within 'a matter of hours' after submission. Apple does not disclose its app review period, but the website appreviewtimes.com puts the average wait time at seven days for Apple's App Store. Developers must answer special questionnaires about their apps to help independent ratings organisations assign age-based ratings, Google said. Millions of Android handsets have been exposed to malware through malicious apps being offered on Google Play. The apps include the Durak card game, along with a history game and IQ test, which combined have been installed more than 15 million times. The apps cause unwanted adverts to display on users' phones and their abnormal behaviour sometimes doesn't appear until a month after installation. The apps were discovered after Prague-based antivirus provider, Avast, received a user complaint. 'This impression remains until you reboot your device and wait for a couple of days,' wrote Filip Chytry, an Avast mobile malware analyst. 'After a week, you might start to feel there is something wrong with your device. Some of the apps wait up to 30 days until they show their true colours.' As well as Durak, the other other games included a Russian IQ test with up to five million installs, and a Russian history app game, which has been installed up to 50,000 times by Android users. These apps have now been removed from Google Play. 'We know that people in different countries have different ideas about what content is appropriate for kids, teens and adults,' Google said in the blog post. 'Today's announcement will help developers better label their apps for the right audience.' As of May, apps submitted without the questionnaire will not be published in Google Play, and existing apps that do not seek a rating could be blocked in certain markets or for certain users, Google said. Google has also partnered with the International Age Rating Coalition, the Pan-European Game Information and the Australian Classification Board, to provide relevant ratings in various countries.

England won just two of their six games at the tournament and only avoided their worst-ever World Cup with a rain-affected nine-wicket success over Afghanistan in Sydney on Friday. 'There are no regrets,' Morgan said. Eoin Morgan speaks to the press following England's victory against Afghanistan in Sydney on Friday . 'Absolutely not. We've given it everything and certainly I have.' England and Wales Cricket Board managing director Paul Downton has already confirmed a 'major review' will be launched into the failings at the tournament. That had led to speculation some senior players could have played their last one-day international, but Morgan does not think there should be a clear-out as preparations begin for the 2019 World Cup, which will be held in England. 'No absolutely not,' he added. 'We haven't got guys coming towards the end of their careers. I don't see a reason to. 'I think we have the right calibre of squad, guys on the outside need to be banging down the door. 'It's an easy thing to sit here while we are not doing well and say somebody outside the squad is better. Morgan (right) congratulates James Tredwell after he caught out Afghanistan captain Mohammad Nabi . 'We considered everybody when selecting the squad. I still believe we had the right group of players here.' Coach Peter Moores' position has come under increasing scrutiny after England were blown away by the bigger nations before their tournament was ended by ninth-ranked Bangladesh in Adelaide on Monday. Their only successes came against associate nations Scotland and Afghanistan, with the latter playing at their first-ever World Cup. Morgan nonetheless wants to remain as captain, although admitted that decision is now out of his hands with the ECB to rake over the performances. 'I think there is going to be a review over the next couple of weeks,' he said. 'I can't determine whether I'll still be captain. The hunger is still there to do it. 'I've learned a lot throughout this tournament particularly when things haven't gone so well. You learn a lot about yourself and about the team. Ian Bell acknowledges the crowd after reaching his half-century in England's final Cricket World Cup match . 'Things like that moving forward are crucial.' England will fly home next week where the recriminations have already begun and Morgan feels any finger pointing should be directed at the players rather than the coach. 'I certainly think it's not fair (to blame Moores),' he said. 'All the responsibility should fall on the players. It's our responsibility to perform, particularly when we've performed so badly. 'If there were little things where we couldn't get over the line and games where we competed and little parts of our game weren't right you could look elsewhere. 'It's important that we realise where the responsibility lies.' Australia and New Zealand most significantly exposed the gulf in class between them and England's squad, which contained nine World Cup debutants, and Morgan conceded his team's inability to fight back in adversity was an area of concern. Captain Morgan speaks to Sky Sports after England sealed a comfortable win at the Sydney Cricket Ground . 'When we've performed well we've done reasonably well and when we've been poor we've been really poor,' he said. 'When you have a bad day you have to find some way of scrapping or fighting in order to stay in the game but when we've had bad games we've been out of the game. 'To build on that we need to get our basics right - things like building an innings, creating partnerships and building pressure with the ball. 'When we've been poor we haven't done both of those things.' While England's players might be bracing themselves for their reception back home, Afghanistan coach Andy Moles expects his team to receive a 'warm welcome' to their war-torn country. Morgan (second left) walks off the field with Bell (third left) as rain delays play on Friday . A maiden World Cup win over Scotland stood out as an obvious highlight and they almost pulled of a shock against Sri Lanka. They were just 22 minutes away from sharing the points with England at the SCG, after play resumed following a long rain break just in time to allow the reply to a Duckworth-Lewis revised target of 101 in 25 overs. Ian Bell's half-century ensured the chase was reeled in without too much alarm, but Afghanistan will head home to their cricket-loving fans knowing they came close to finishing the tournament level on points with England. 'I'm sure that they'll be received with huge warmth,' Moles, a former Warwickshire opener, said. England coach Peter Moores is pictured walking off the field after Friday's match in Sydney . 'We all saw the celebrations that happened all around Afghanistan with the win against Scotland. But I think the captain would be the first to admit, as well, we'd liked to have done a little bit better with some of the other games, but that's something we'll work on. 'One thing I can say is that the Afghan players are a very proud bunch of young men that want to do well, not for themselves but for the unification and the message it sends around the world from Afghanistan. 'So I know, I'm sure that when they do get home in two, three days' time that they will be warmly received, and I'm sure they'll enjoy it.'", "reference": "England failed to qualify from their group after just two victories .\nCaptain Eoin Morgan insists he leaves Australia with no regrets .\nEngland beat Afghanistan by nine wickets in their final World Cup match ."}, "156": {"id": "d1fa592a30fca957b1daf5f4c9f6e6874fd31caf", "article": "You might want to think twice the next time you put some bacon under the grill. A video has revealed just how smart pigs are, which may leave some people a little more reluctant to tuck into a choice cut of pig. The latest evidence of the creature's intelligence shows a pig sorting shapes without any human intervention. Moritz the pig in Berlin, Germany has solved a complex puzzle. The pig did it without any help from a human. In a video (shown) the pig puts coloured shapes into a wooden block. Recent research also revealed they have empathy like humans . The video was recorded by Nicolle von Eberkopf, who lives in Berlin, Germany. In a video, Moritz the pig places coloured pig-shaped blocks in corresponding coloured holes on a wooden board. The pig does this using its mouth, without any help. \u2018Animals are an important part of our society,\u2019 said Ms von Eberkopf. The sign of pig intelligence follows research earlier this year when scientists discovered that the creatures may be capable of empathy - a characteristic thought to be almost uniquely human. In an elaborate experiment, experts discovered that pigs shared the stress and happiness of their penmates. This findings by Wageningen University in the Netherlands\u00a0suggest that swine respond to each other\u2019s feelings, and adds weight to the argument that the practice of separating the animals in farms is especially cruel. The pigs were trained either to anticipate happiness or distress, by playing them music and either rewarding them with a pleasant treat such as chocolate raisins and a roomy house filled with peat, or putting them in a stressful situation, such as keeping them in isolation in a small pen. Untrained, \u2018na\u00efve\u2019 pigs were placed in a pen with a pig conditioned to expect happiness, or one that expected discomfort. All the pigs were then played the same music \u2013 a piece by Bach - used in training. Some of the trained pigs showed that they anticipated what may happen to them, either by displaying happy behaviours - such as wagging their tails and barking - or signs of stress, such as keeping their ears back, urinating and defecating. Despite most of the trained pigs failing to react at all, they were still taken to another pen, leaving the na\u00efve pigs behind, and were either rewarded or punished, depending on their training. The na\u00efve pigs, which could not have known what lay in store for their penmates, reacted to the trained pigs\u2019 behaviour anyway. Asian elephants show concern for others when they are stressed, using their trunks to caress the suffering elephant and emit a soft 'chirp,' Discovery\u00a0recently\u00a0reported. Consoling elephants put their trunk into another elephant's mouth so they are vulnerable, perhaps showing they are there to help. Crows and ravens are also known to be emotionally intelligent, with researchers at the Konrad Lorenz Research Station in Austria finding that the birds comfort others that are stressed after a fight. Ravens sit next to the distressed bird so their bodies are touching and sometimes preen it. University of Portsmouth research has shown that orangutans (stock image) can be so full of empathy that they take on the moods of others. When one orangutan laughs, others often join in . Scrub jays - another member of the Corvid family - have 'funerals' for deceased friends, according to research by the University of California, Davis. They fly over the dead body, wailing and screeching, which may be a sign of grief. Mice have been shown to detect pain among others but only appear to console their family and friends. Garet Lahvis, an assistant professor at Oregon Health and Science University, said: 'Mice are capable of a more complex form of empathy than we ever believed possible.' Similarly, rats are believed to be able to respond to excitement, fear and anger. They even help each other out with no prospect of a reward, according to Washington State University. The rodents also show that they enjoy being tickled and playing by giggling. Gorillas not only care for each other but have even been seen to care for dolls.

The sign of pig intelligence follows research earlier this year when scientists discovered that the creatures may be capable of empathy - a characteristic thought to be almost uniquely human. In an elaborate experiment, experts discovered that pigs shared the stress and happiness of their penmates . For example, when a trained pig showed it was stressed, a na\u00efve pig acted in the same way, by becoming more alert and keeping its ears back. The behaviour was even more noticeable when the untrained animals noticed the behaviour of trained \u2018happy\u2019 pigs, with the animals becoming more playful and wagging their tails. To test that the animals were responding to each other\u2019s behaviour and not simply the music, the scientists played the na\u00efve pigs the tune. They showed no signs of changing their behaviour, indicating they were showing empathy with the trained animals.

By contrast Mr Cameron's house in West London home would narrowly escape the mansion tax, being valued at \u00a31.971million.

Lawrence Hall of Zoopla said: 'Soulless second kitchen or not, Ed Miliband's home is in a desirable part of London and is now worth a lot more than he paid for it before the last election. 'He may, however, have to put any plans for upgrading his kitchens on hold if Labour comes to power as his tax bill is likely to rise by at least \u00a33,000 per year.'

Ted Cruz, appearing this morning in his first nationally-broadcast interview since announcing yesterday that he would run for president, attempted to shed his conservative hardliner image. Cruz said social liberals were 'absolutely' welcome in his version of the Republican Party and that he's willing to compromise - as long as those concessions move the country forward. 'I have never said I won't compromise,' Cruz told Today's Matt Lauer after the ABC News host asked if he'd bring the same brand of 'no compromise' politics to the White House that he's brought to the Senate. Scroll down for videos . Republican Sen. Ted Cruz appeared this morning in his first nationally-broadcast interview since announcing yesterday that he would run for president . Cruz, accompanied by his wife Heidi for the interview, attempted to shed his conservative hardliner image. 'I have never said I won't compromise,' he told Today's Matt Lauer after the ABC News host asked if he'd bring the same brand of 'no compromise' politics to the White House that he's brought to the Senate . The 44-year-old Texas senator contended that from day one he has said he'd compromise the way that revered Republican president Ronald Reagan did. 'What do you do if they offer you half a loaf? Answer: you take it,' he said, 'and then come back.' Confronted with a past statement in which he said, 'I don't think Washington needs is more compromise,' Cruz suggested to Lauer that his words had been misinterpreted. 'What Washington does often is it compromises going backwards,' he said. 'I'm perfectly happy to work with anyone, Democrat, independent, libertarian, Republican, if they are shrinking the size and power of the federal government, if they are turning around the debt, if they're expanding liberty.' Cruz said that lawmakers in the nation's capitol often makes deals that are 'not a good compromise' thought because they don't fix the problem at hand. A freshman senator, Cruz said he's sought 'more than anything else' during his time in the federal government is to 'tell the truth' and 'do what I said I would do.' Though voters may not always agree with his principles, the conservative lawmaker said he believes they can respect that he stays true to his word. With his run for the White House Cruz said he hopes to rebuild the coalition that elected Reagan and attract more women, Hispanics and young people to the Republican Party. Presidential candidate-in-waiting Rand Paul suggested in an interview Monday night on Fox News that his Senate colleague panders too much to conservatives to grow the GOP, however. Acknowledging that he and Cruz have 'very, very similar voting records,' Paul said 'what makes us different is probably our approach as to how we would make the party bigger.' 'And I\u2019m a big believer that you should stand on principle, and be true to your principles. But I also think that we should take those principles and try to bring in new people with them,' he asserted. Paul pointed out that as part of his preparations for a national run, he's traveled to areas that Republicans don't traditionally campaign in and spoken to groups such as the NAACP that Republicans haven't historically engaged with. 'And maybe not just throwing out red meat, but actually throwing out something intellectually enticing to people who haven\u2019t been listening to our message before.' Continuing he said, 'So, it isn\u2019t just about rousing the base, it\u2019s about exciting the base by being for the principles of liberty, but it\u2019s then taking those principles of liberty, not diluting them, and taking them to new people and bringing them into the party. 'That\u2019s the way you win general elections.' The 52-year-old freshman lawmaker argued that his approach makes him more viable in a general election that other conservatives vying for the nomination - including Cruz. 'There will be a lot of conservatives. Ted Cruz is a conservative, but it also goes to winnability, and people will have to make a decision which is the Republican that can not only excite the base, but can also bring new people into the party without giving up principles,' he said, noting that he fares better in polls against presumed Democratic presidential candidate, and nominee, Hillary Clinton. Heidi said a trait that drew her to her husband was that he is 'a person of conviction.' She said, 'Ted Cruz is someone who tells the truth. He knows what he believes' Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul speaks with diners at Beantowne Coffee House & Cafe on Saturday in Hampstead, New Hampshire. Paul said in an interview Monday that he'd be a better general election candidate than Cruz or any of the other conservatives running because he appeals to groups that are not \u00a0traditionally Republican . Joining Cruz for his interview Tuesday morning was his wife, Heidi. A trait that drew her to her husband, the the senator's wife said, is that he is 'a person of conviction.' 'Ted Cruz is someone who tells the truth. He knows what he believes.' He's also very 'agile' in fragile situations, she said, repeating phrasing Lauer used in a question to her. Lauer had noted Cruz's kindly response to a little girl at one of his recent speeches who became frightened when he claimed that the 'world is on fire.' Heidi said he takes the same care when addressing his six-year-old, Caroline. Recently, Caroline came home from school, she said, upset that everyone was talking about her father rather than her. 'And Ted said, \"Wow,\" he said,\" the same is true for me. I spend my day talking about you!\"= . Mrs. Cruz, who has not made herself available in the past for major media interviews quite like her talkative husband, commented that it may not be possible to ever 'feel fully prepared' for a journey like the one she and her family are taking, 'but we have a very strong marriage, an incredibly strong family, and are guided by our faith.

According to NBC, police were called aboard the flight, which had come from Nicaragua, and tried to calm her down, but were met with the response: 'F*** you. This is not a democracy'. She was arrested for disorderly conduct and jailed at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center. A statement from Penn State on Tuesday confirmed that Halnon is a member of staff.

In her political rant about the flight she explored her political beliefs, equating the United States's tough economic sanctions against Venezuela with a declaration of war. She also cited Hugo Chavez as a 'hero' of hers, and allegedly said that Obama 'kills people on Tuesdays'. She shouted: 'The United States has declared war on Venezuela. Venezuela has been declared a national security threat.' 'You're a national security threat,' a passenger remarked off camera. 'She's gangster' another passenger said laughing. Flight attendants warned the woman that\u00a0the police would be waiting for her once the plane landed if she didn't calm down, according to\u00a0The Daily Dot. So she yelled louder. She ranted: 'Venezuela previously owned the oil in Venezuela. My great hero Hugo Chavez nationalized the oil supply so that people with all of the oil...not Exon Mobil would go away!' Bizarrely, she shouted: 'The people own the oil.' According to an eyewitness, the woman added that U.S. President Barack Obama 'kills people on Tuesdays.' After another warning by a flight attendant the woman protested: 'I know already the [police are coming to take me off the aircraft.] But before I'm arrested I'm going to say my peace. 'They already say they are arresting me so I'm going to tell you more,' she told passengers while unbuckling her seat belt and standing up. Her illegal deed was caught on camera by a flyer who then posted the video  to YouTube and website Reddit.

And he's happy to share his shopping tips. The biggest drawback? You'll have to spend hours on bargain sites, like CatchOfTheDay waiting for the best deals to appear. Ian Burnett from Jeparit Victoria has spent $28,000 over 8 years on CatchOfTheDay and has saved $10,000 . The father of four admits he has sat on the site for 12 hours straight before and spends a few hours on it a day . 'I've sat on the site for 12 straight hours before,' Ian told Daily Mail Australia. 'At 12 o'clock everyday, they release a new product... So you obviously have to be online for that.'

His insider shopping tips include checking the site everyday after 12 for brand new bargain . He purchases gifts for his children, groceries and various household items from CatchOfTheDay . 'I also buy in bulk as they have a shipping cap,' he said. 'You can pick up 10 or 20 items and get them shipped for the same price as if you got one.' Ian also said he has paid for a yearly subscription to CatchOfTheDay free shipping before for $75 and for an avid shopper like him, that saves a lot. Comparing products to others sold at big retailers is also important according to Ian, as you can see how much is being saved. And for a father of four who works in a supermarket, he is very much in the know. Ian's proudest purchase was a Nintendo WII for his four children after they insisted it was all they wanted. He did not think he'd be able to fork out the $400 for one in retail so he used his skills to find one discounted to $99.

He quickly learnt how to read eight-letter words and now corrects mother Emma, 39, if she misreads his bedtime story book. Yet his family say he also loves riding his bike and splashing in puddles like any other young boy. Mother-of-two Emma, a postal worker from Yate, Bristol, said: \u2018We don\u2019t push him because we are content to let him be himself \u2013 but he just teaches himself. Michael can read to himself and experts said his scores for logical thinking 'hit the ceiling' when tested . \u2018He is quite fascinated by numbers, and also loves big words. \u2018His English is very good, but he is like a sponge and his retention is brilliant.\u2019 Emma and husband Anthony, 33, a chef, first noticed Michael\u2019s talent when he was 18 months old and started to learn from educational games on the iPad. But soon he was asking questions his family couldn\u2019t answer. Michael\u2019s grandmother Jenny Greenwood took him to a specialist in Birmingham and tests found he had a reading and spelling age of eight \u2013 and an IQ of 145. The UK average is 104. She said: \u2018In the last few weeks he has been obsessed with the planets, learning all the names and where they are.\u2019 Michael\u2019s parents have not submitted him for Mensa membership because they feel he is too young, although the youngest-ever member was just two years and four months-old. Membership of the society is reserved for those with an IQ in the top 2 per cent of the population, around 148. IQ can change over time but most will not change by more than a few points. The score will usually stay the same as it is a measure of ability rather than knowledge. Dr Peter Congdon, who performed intelligence tests on Michael, said he was \u2018in the very superior range\u2019 and should jump a year at school so he is not held back. He said: \u2018He is outstanding, there is no doubt about it.\u2019 The three-year-old can spell eight word letters on his own, spelling words he has never seen come across . As well as doing his times tables and learning several languages, Michael likes doing 'normal' things for his age like splashing in puddles. The youngster (pictured) has taught himself by using his mother's iPad . Mensa was founded in England in 1946 by Roland Berrill, a barrister, and Dr Lance Ware, a scientist and lawyer. The society welcomes people from all backgrounds who have an IQ is in the top two per cent of the population. Albert Einstein apparently had an IQ of 160, while former US presidents Abraham Lincoln, Benjamin Franklin and Bill Clinton also racked up very high IQs - mustering 128, 160 and 137 respectively. Napoleon Bonaparte scored 145 and Sigmund Freud had a score of 156. There are currently more than 1,000 members of Mensa aged under 18. Children under the age of 10-and-a-half can join Mensa by submitting prior evidence of their IQ score being in the top two per cent. Adults and children over the age of 10-and-a-half, take the Mensa Supervised IQ Test. The youngest person to ever join British Mensa was Elise Tan Roberts in 2009 aged 2 years and four months.", "reference": "Michael McBride is three-years-old and can already count to 10 in Russian .\nAt 18 months he began learning words and numbers from mother's iPad .\nHe taught himself Russian and Japanese and can do his 14 times table .\nYoungster adds up the shopping bill and calculates the correct change .\nHe has an IQ of 145 - just a few points off the level required to join Mensa .\nParents Emma, a postwoman, and Anthony, a chef, add he still enjoys 'splashing in puddles' like other boys his age ."}, "169": {"id": "4f3d047137bf1355eee8098d45eb4fd97800ef15", "article": "Malky Mackay signed Troy Deeney for Watford so he knows exactly what the powerhouse striker can do. On Tuesday night, he scored twice against Mackay\u2019s Wigan for the second time this season to send Watford top of the Championship and a step nearer the Premier League. It was the sixth game in a row that Deeney has been on the scoresheet, muscling in to beat Ali Al-Habsi with a header nine minutes into the second half and then converting a penalty in stoppage time. For Wigan and his old manager, however, the threat of relegation to League One looms large two years after the club dropped out of the top-flight.

That\u2019s why I bought him (for Watford) in the first place. He\u2019s blossomed and he\u2019s by far and away the best centre-forward in the division in my opinion.\u2019 Despite the poor home form, Wigan had won their last four away games to give themselves a chance of survival and they had several chances to take the lead. Tommy Hoban had to throw his body in the way of Leon Clarke\u2019s goalbound effort, Sheyi Ojo blasted over when unmarked in a good position and Marc-Antoine Fortune had two opportunities. Deeney beats the challenge of Wigan's Gaetan Bong to score his side's opening goal at the DW Stadium . Boyce fells Watford's\u00a0Fernando Forestieri in the box to give away a penalty on a bad night for the hosts . But the promotion chasers went ahead in the 54th minute with a goal that was the product of classy build-up play and a brutal finish. Substitute Fernando Forestieri\u2019s clever pass gave Adlene Guedioura the opportunity to swing a cross to the far post where Deeney was charging in like an express train. The Watford skipper powered through Jason Pearce to meet the ball and head the ball emphatically past Al Habsi. Guedioura and Matej Vydra both went close with shots after that, and Guedioura thought he had doubled Watford\u2019s lead when his deflected effort beat Al Habsi but Emmerson Boyce hooked the ball away to safety from under his own crossbar. Wigan goalkeeper Ali Al-Habsi is rooted to the spot as Deeney sends his second goal past him with a penalty . However Deeney made sure of victory in stoppage time, scoring from the penalty spot after Boyce had brought down Forestieri.

Palace\u2019s home form this season is the second worst in the Barclays Premier League, with bottom-side Leicester City the only club worse than them on home turf. The Selhurst Park pitch has been re-laid twice this season, and with Pardew admitting the surface \u2018isn\u2019t perfect\u2019, he has called his players into the stadium that they face QPR in on Saturday to practice their dead-ball routines.

Palace's away form has been impressive, but Pardew admits they need to improve their fortunes at home . The Selhurst Park pitch has been relaid twice this season, and is not as impressive as other top flight clubs . \u2018For us, we just need to make sure we pick up points or pick up wins when we can and we\u2019ll be ok. We have a cushion at the moment but it can be easily eroded with a defeat tomorrow so we need to make sure that we\u2019re on our metal.\u2019 Palace, with 30 points, are currently eight points clear of third-bottom QPR but Pardew still believes it will require a further 10 before his side are sure of staying up.", "reference": "Crystal Palace face Queens Park Rangers at Selhurst Park on Saturday .\nPalace have been training at Selhurst Park in preparation for the game .\nAlan Pardew said that Palace are 'a good set-play team so we\u2019ve been getting used to the co-ordinates' at Selhurst Park .\nQPR are desperate for a win after seven defeats in their last eight .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Crystal Palace news ."}, "171": {"id": "0f786c5e1aea95e19e287236e9c7bd2a9c5ce645", "article": "A golden opportunity to register a rare victory on the PGA Tour slipped through the fingers of Paul Casey and Ian Poulter on Monday. But their failure opened the door for an even more heart-warming outcome: victory for two-time Open winner Padraig Harrington at the second play-off hole of the Honda Classic at Palm Beach Gardens in Florida. The crushing decline of Harrington has been documented well enough in  the past six years. Padraig Harrington celebrates his Honda Classic golf win on Monday at Palm Beach Gardens . Harrington tips his hat to the crowd as he walks to the green on the second playoff hole . Ian Poulter plays his shot out of a bunker on the 14th hole during The Honda Classic . With Harrington in danger of falling outside the world\u2019s top 300, it seemed a mystery why he didn\u2019t put his name forward last month as a candidate to be Europe\u2019s captain at the Ryder Cup in Minnesota next year. But the model Irishman, now 43, had the last word on Monday with his first win in seven years on one of the two main tours. Reduced to asking for invitations to play in America these days, he made full use of one at the Honda Classic. He led at halfway, and then in a see-saw final round he got the better of rookie American Daniel Berger having needed a birdie at the 18th to force a play-off. Jack Nicklaus opined that he could see tension in the Harrington swing during the third round, which was hardly surprising given all the problems he\u2019s had on the course these last few years. Poulter of England and his caddie are seen during the continuation of the fourth round of The Honda Classic . After winning The Open in 2007 and 2008, followed by the US PGA Championship the same year, he suffered his first winless year for a decade in 2009. While the Irishman managed just one top-five finish in majors over the next five years, his ranking plummeted from world No 2 to 297 at the start of this year. After yesterday\u2019s win, Harrington moves up to No 82 and qualifies for this year\u2019s Masters. And some of the putting woes that have contributed to his fall re-appeared during the final round, only for Harrington to hold his nerve with a level-par 70 that set up the win. Harrington said: \u2018Hopefully this isn\u2019t an isolated win. I think I have found that mental edge I had been missing and hopefully I can be consistently contending. Believe it or not, when I get in contention I can still hit the shots.\u2019 For Casey, it was the second week in a row he had experienced such frustration, after losing a sudden death play-off in the Northern Trust Open last week. For Poulter, who went into the water five times in a final round of 75 that left him tied third with Casey, it means the long wait to register a stroke-play success on American soil, stretching back over 150 events and more than 10 years, goes on. Harrington putts on the second playoff hole during The Honda Classic at PGA National Resort & Spa . The 39-year-old has won stroke-play events in Africa, Asia, Australia and Europe, but his sole victory in the US came in the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship in Arizona in 2010. \u2018It\u2019s just bitterly disappointing to put myself in the position I have, to play as well as I\u2019ve played... and a couple of loose shots has cost me this tournament,\u2019 said Poulter. \u2018It\u2019s a shame to hand tournaments away.\u2019 A Monday finish at the Honda Classic proved a necessity after violent storms had wreaked havoc on Friday and Saturday. The two Englishmen began the last 11 holes of the final round on Monday with a one-stroke lead over Patrick Reed. Paul Casey watches his tee shot on the 15th hole during The Honda Classic at PGA National Resort & Spa . Both Englishmen will look to the positives after going so close. For Poulter it brings to an end a miserable 15 months during which he hasn\u2019t finished in the top 10 in tournaments, never mind win. For Casey, it\u2019s further evidence that his career is now firmly back on track. The 37-year-old turned his back on the European Tour to concentrate on America this year and his decision has been vindicated by his golf over the past fortnight. Barely inside the world\u2019s top 100 at the beginning of February, he is on the verge of earning an invitation to play in the Masters in April. The scene now switches 60 miles south to Miami and the first event this year in which all the world\u2019s best players are in the same place at the same time \u2014 the WGC Cadillac Championship at Doral.", "reference": "Paul Casey and Ian Poulter let a rare PGA Tour victory slip away .\nTheir failure opened the door for\u00a0two-time Open winner Padraig Harrington .\nIt was Harrington's first win in seven years on one of the two main tours .\nPoulter finishes in the Top 10 of a\u00a0tournament\u00a0for first time in 15 months ."}, "172": {"id": "c3670ff789d818ed061480f57e8c1c274751c398", "article": "With BBQ season on the horizon, bell peppers are set to come into their own.

And yet, if this amazing ossuary was false, then it was one of the greatest forgeries in history. Underlying the question of the authenticity of the ossuary is an even bigger theological problem: whether or not Jesus actually had any brothers. Though the debate's origins are ancient, the answer still divides Catholics and Protestants. For Catholics, Mary, Joseph and Jesus are a family unit unto themselves. Yet Catholic theology also holds that Jesus was God's son, born of the virgin -- and that Mary did not give birth to other children, divine or otherwise. 'Finding Jesus': John the Baptist Q&A . So who are these \"brothers\" that the Gospel of Mark mentions? The Rev. James Martin, author of the book \"Jesus: A Pilgrimage,\" calls the relationship between James and Jesus \"very complicated.\" \"He's called clearly the brother of the Lord, and the Greek uses the common word for brother,\" Martin says. But Catholics also believe in Mary's perpetual virginity, so Martin surmises that James and the other brothers were Joseph's children from a prior marriage.\"It makes sense that Joseph would have been older and Mary was younger, so I see them in a sense as stepbrothers.\" Other Catholic scholars see James and Jesus  as cousins, an idea that began in the fourth century, when St. Jerome, who translated the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament into Latin, argued the point against the theologian Helvedius, who said Mary and Joseph had other children. 'Finding Jesus': Shroud of Turin Q&A . Jerome countered that these children were instead born to Mary of Clopas, Jesus' aunt. Jerome used his linguistic facility to argue that \"adelphios,\" the Greek word used for Jesus' brothers and sisters, could refer to cousins, as well as to siblings. Protestants, however, see Jesus' family as free of ambiguity, with Mary and Joseph having several children. One of them is Jesus -- but the question then becomes, which one? Ben Witherington III, professor of New Testament Interpretation at Asbury Theological Seminary, offers the Protestant view that Jesus and James were full brothers, with Jesus being the elder. \"The New Testament says nothing about Mary being a perpetual virgin, it says she virginally conceived Jesus, and it certainly implies that she went on to have more children after that, and his brothers and sisters are in fact his brothers and sisters,\" Witherington says. Is Judas in hell? Jesus is presented as the older brother who leaves the family and walks about in Galilee and Judea, has a ministry and leaves James and the other brothers and sisters in charge of the family, according to the scholar. What's more contentious for some Protestants, is the fact that Jesus, as the eldest in the family, essentially forsook his obligation as next-in-line to head the family after Joseph died. Instead he followed his divine destiny, as ordained by his father in heaven. 5 things you didn't know about Jesus . That left James to fill the void. Whatever he was -- brother, step-brother or cousin -- we know that James became important in the early Christian church because of his relation to Jesus. Paul, the apostle who transformed the new religion from a local phenomenon into a movement throughout the Roman Empire, says as much in his letter to the Galatians: . \"Then after three years I did go up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and stayed with him 15 days;  but I did not see any other apostle except James the Lord's brother.\" James and Peter and Paul were the prime movers of this new faith, with James the leader of the Jesus followers in Jerusalem until he was martyred in 64 CE, forgiving his killers with his last breath, just as his brother Jesus had done. Given his importance to the early Christian Church, why wouldn't he be connected to his brother, or even stepbrother, on the burial box containing his bones?

The man, named only as Mr Xiao, was shocked to find the rare giant salamander swimming in the water and later released it back into the wild, reported the\u00a0People's Daily Online. Although it is one of the world's oldest species \u2013 dating back more than 170 million years \u2013 there are few surviving populations of giant salamander left in the wild. Its appearance has barely changed since the Jurassic period. Scroll down for video . Giant: The salamander found by Mr Xiao measured 83cm in length and weighed in at 5.5kg . Shock: Park ranger Mr Xiao could not believe his eyes when he saw the rare creature swimming in the river . The giant salamander, which measured 83cm in length and weighed 5.5kg, was found in Heyuan City in southern China's Guangdong Province. After keeping it in a temporary tank, Mr Xiao released the creature back into the river, watched by a crowd of fascinated tourists. The giant salamander is listed as 'critically endangered' on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List and a protected species in China. Prize catch: Mr Xiao shows off his discovery, the first of its kind to be found in the area . Fine specimen: The Chinese giant salamander is the world\u2019s largest living amphibian and has been known to grow up to 1.8m long . Despite its status as an endangered species, it is still regarded a delicacy among China's super rich. The salamander population has declined drastically over the last 30 years due to poaching and destruction of its habitat. Earlier this year Chinese officials were investigated for reportedly eating a giant salamander at a luxury banquet in Shenzhen. A recent government crackdown means that anyone found to be eating endangered species could receive a jail sentence of up to ten years. Attention: A young boy enjoys his moment with the rare amphibian before it is returned to the wild. 30 years ago the giant salamander was relatively common . It is believed by some that the salamander has anti-ageing benefits, although there is no scientific evidence to support this. The giant salamander holds a treasured place in Chinese mythology and is called 'wa wa yu' - or 'baby fish' - in Chinese because its distress call sounds like the cry of a baby. In the past the amphibian could grow to more than 1.8 metres in length and over 50 kilograms in weight, but due to wild harvesting most salamanders today are much smaller.", "reference": "Ranger was shocked to see the giant salamander while picking winkles .\nThe ancient amphibian measured 83cm in length and weighed 5.5kg .\nThe animal\u00a0is  critically endangered on the Red List of threatened species .\nKnown as a 'living fossil', it has barely changed since the Jurassic period .\nIn China it is known as 'wa wa yu' - or 'baby fish' - because its distress call sounds like the cry of a baby ."}, "180": {"id": "d03649f96c73aed8df97783098017a4f82e52571", "article": "Arsenal superstars were put through their paces during a final training session before they head to France in a bid to rescue their Champions League hopes in their last 16 return leg clash with Monaco.

A wall of water and mud surged through Sam Upan's house, toppling the walls of the neighboring church where he serves as a deacon. It was midnight on Friday, and he had no choice but to wade out into the gale force wind and darkness. \"The water was up to my waist!\" he says. Upan eventually made it to higher ground, taking shelter on a parked van.  Fortunately, he had sent his family away before the storm to a shelter in the center of the capital, Port Vila. But on Monday, three days after the storm struck, Upan and his daughters sit in the debris strewn rubble of their home. On Sunday, he built a temporary shack for them to sleep under.  A bundle of bananas donated by a friend lies nearby in the mud. It's the only food the family has to eat. Nearby, Upan's daughter Elsie slowly scrubs mud out of a shirt. Other families all across this tropical town are facing similar difficulties in the aftermath of the storm. To many Westerners, Vanuatu is a holiday destination boasting crystal blue waters and luxury yachts. But it's also one of the poorest nations in the Pacific, and many of its 260,000 inhabitants live in flimsy houses built of thatch or metal sheets. Those vulnerable homes were dealt a fearsome blow over the weekend by Cyclone Pam, one of the strongest storms ever to make landfall. The aid group Oxfam is warning that the cyclone may have caused \"one of the worst disasters ever seen in the Pacific.\" The storm rampaged across Vanuatu's sprawling archipelago of more than 80 islands on Friday and Saturday, wielding 155 mph (250 kph) winds. About 65 islands in the archipelago are inhabited. The full extent of the devastation remained unclear Monday. With communication lines to many of the outer islands cut, it could take days or even weeks to emerge. Eleven people have so far been confirmed dead, according to Vanuatu authorities said. But the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said the toll was expected to rise. The agency said 3,300 people were taking shelter in 37 evacuation centers. How to help Vanuatu residents . Vanuatu President Baldwin Lonsdale told CNN the destruction was the worst his country had ever experienced, describing the storm as \"a monster.\" He said it would take the developing nation \"a couple of years\" to get back to where it was before Pam struck. In the capital, Port Vila, residents were still reeling from the storm's impact. Thousands of people have been left homeless and many who rely on subsistence farming to get by have seen their main source of food wiped out. Most people live on root crops, said Jonathan Napat, a ranking natural disaster official. \"What the people depend on entirely is just wiped out.\" He was overwhelmed by the dimension of the food loss. \"Just unbearable. Just too much to contain,\" he said. A CNN team that arrived in the capital Monday saw more than 100 people taking refuge in church. In one valley, trees were snapped in two or stripped of leaves. Many residents said it was the worst storm that they can remember. And that's in a Pacific nation that's regularly hit by cyclones. Officials say Cyclone Pam destroyed or badly damaged 90% of the houses in Port Vila, as well as flooding parts of the hospital and trashing schools and churches. There were some small signs of progress around the capital. A lack of electricity and running water hasn't stopped residents from starting the hard work of clearing away fallen trees and branches, as well as the corrugated metal roofing that Pam ripped off thousands of buildings. The sound of chainsaws and handsaws can be heard throughout the shell-shocked community. The main airport is back in business, allowing military aircraft from Australia and New Zealand to bring in aid workers and supplies. The first commercial flight since the storm landed Monday. But the big unknown remains the scale of the destruction the huge storm wrought on the outer islands to the north and south of the capital. \"It's certainly deeply concerning because those islands down there were incredibly hard hit,\" said Tom Perry, a spokesman for the aid organization CARE International. Many people now lack the basics of life: clean water, food and shelter. \"Homes have been lost, crops are destroyed. The damage is enormous, and people need our help,\" said Aurelia Balpe, head of the Red Cross in the Pacific. \"Yet it will still take some time before we really understand the full extent of the damage.\" Some 60,000 children are in need of assistance, UNICEF reported Sunday. Vanuatu has officially declared a state of emergency, opening the door for other countries to help. The country's remote location adds to the challenges facing the international response. Port Vila is more than 1,770 kilometers (1,100 miles) northeast of Brisbane on Australia's east coast, and some 2,200 kilometers north of Auckland, the closest city in New Zealand.

The liner was off the coast of Norway and the captain decided she was so ill she would need to be transferred to a hospital immediately. Crew members strapped her to a stretcher with a blanket and tried to pass her to a team on a lifeboat which had pulled up beside the ship. But the two boats, which were travelling side-by-side at 10 knots, were not tethered together and began to move apart at the crucial moment, plunging Mrs Richardson into the sea. One witness, Colin Prescott, told a later inquest: \u2018I saw the stretcher hit the side of the vessel. Mrs Richardson went one way and the stretcher went the other.\u2019 Mrs Richardson was treated in Norway before being airlifted back to the UK. Her husband kept a bedside vigil until her death on April 21. Mrs Richardson was being moved from the cruise ship to a rescue boat on a stretcher when she was dropped . Because Mrs Richardson suffered from cirrhosis of the liver, high blood pressure and was an insulin-dependent diabetic prior to the cruise and because she later died of natural causes the compensation payment was restricted. The grandmother of eight was 18st and had a history of ill-health but her inquest heard that fighting for her life in freezing temperatures may have significantly contributed to her death. The Ocean Countess was owned by Cruise and Maritime Voyages (CMV) at the time but caught fire near Greece in 2013 and has since been sold for scrap.

Alex Aimard and his friend Petter Jonsson leapt from a plane over Eloy in Arizona armed with a parachute doused in kerosene, a flare gun and a Go Pro camera. And after deploying their parachutes, the pair then pull out the guns during their descent to set fire to their canopies. Alex Aimard aims his flare gun at his petrol-soaked parachute after jumping out of a plane over the Arizona . The fire from the gun causes the parachute to ignite and causes a blaze in the Mr Aimard's canopy . With just seconds to react and release the now flaming parachutes before the fire travelled down cords to their bodies, the pair free themselves. But luckily they also have an emergency parachute, meaning they then glide safely to the ground. The pair, who are both experienced professional skydivers and BASE jumpers, had meticulously planned the dangerous stunt, which took place earlier this year. Mr Jonsson, from Sweden, said: 'I was so focused on my task that I didn't have time to be scared or think about what could have gone wrong.'

'It was like being part of a Rambo movie for real.' The duo had been taking part in a two-week online project called Living the Dream, when they travelled to Utah and Arizona to perform the sky dives. The potentially deadly fire stunt took place on the last day of their trip. Mr Aimard explained: 'We struggled with the weather conditions and the project was on hold for a few days due to a strong wind, which gave us plenty of time for preparation.

With the parachute in flames, \u00a0Mr Jonsson then starts plummeting to earth at more than 120mph . But despite the dangerous stunt Mr Jonsson makes it safely back down to the ground thanks to his emergency parachute . 'Skydiving itself is not without danger and flying in a plane with two big buckets full of gas and two flare guns doesn't decrease the risk. 'You can imagine a lot of things going wrong but with fine tuned preparation there was no room for doubt or uncontrolled fear.' But despite the stunt receiving praise from fellow skydiving professionals, there was some online criticism. But Mr Aimard explained: 'Globally the response was very positive, but we got a couple of messages complaining about the pollution and how immature it was to do that.

Babies were very much the order of the day for the Duchess, who was in Woolwich to meet volunteers helping out at Home-Start, a charity that helps more than 29,000 families a year. Its 15,000 volunteers visit clients in their homes, helping parents struggling to cope with issues such as isolation, mental ill health, bereavement, multiple births, illness or disability - many of which have a direct effect on their children. The Duchess declined a biscuit but listened intently as Rob Parkinson, CEO of Home-Start UK, outlined the work they did. Then it was on to meet some of the families who have received often life-changing help from the charity including Charlene Roper, 25 and her partner Graham Wilders Jnr, 32, who were with their impeccably behaved three-month-old daughter Francesca, the youngest of their three children. Kate also commiserated with some of the mothers at the coffee morning about sleeping patterns and feeding routines. \u2018It can be hard, can\u2019t it,\u2019 she said sympathetically. \u2018So often it\u2019s about giving you the confidence to interact with your baby.\u2019 She also spoke with a group of mothers, who did not wish to be identified, who had suffered with post natal depression. \u2018The Duchess made clear in advance of the visit that she was keen to speak to them as post-natal depression can have such a knock-on effect on every aspect of family life,\u2019 explained head of communications Annie O\u2019Brian.

Before leaving the royal mother-to-be was given a bag with some useful gifts: a potty training for boys book, a manual on how to teach children to tie their shoelaces, a toy sorter and an Elmer the elephant book. \u2018Oh that\u2019s perfect,\u2019 she laughed, looking at the potty training manual with a view to her son, Prince George, will turn two in July, \u2018We will certainly be needing that!\u2019 As she left the engagement - likely to be one of her last public appearances before she gives birth - the Duchess thanked staff and told them: \u2018I can now see how the work you does makes such a difference to all these families. It is remarkable.\u2019 Home-Start CEO Rob Parkinson said afterwards that he was delighted at how the visit had gone. \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter where you come from, when you are a mother there is a commonality there \u2013 something that the Duchess saw for herself today,\u2019 he said. \u2018She was brilliant in the way she chatted with the other mothers and seemed genuinely interested to learn more about our work. I think she left with a very good idea of what Home-Start is all about.\u2019 Busy schedule: The visit is the Duchess' second in as many days and is part of her work as a champion for underprivileged families . Looking good: The Duchess of Cambridge cut a glamorous figure in her cheap chic maternity dress by online retailer ASOS . Kate, although eight months pregnant, has had a notably busy schedule of late and spent yesterday presenting sprigs of shamrock to the 1st Battalion, the Irish Guards. With husband Prince William, the Duchess watched as 200 soldiers from the regiment completed their traditional St. Patrick's Day parade in the square at the Mons Barracks in Aldershot. But while the Duke of Cambridge opted to get into the spirit of things at the reception afterwards and enjoyed a pint of Guinness, the Duchess, who had earlier struggled to attach a shamrock posy to the collar of Irish wolfhound Domhnall, sensibly stuck to water. While the Duchess of Cambridge was visiting children in Woolwich, Prince William at Buckingham Palace where he took part in a series of official audiences with the Queen. In what will be seen as a sign of the Duke's increasingly central role within the Royal Family, William joined his grandmother as she accepted the letters patent from the new Austrian and Nicaraguan ambassadors. Meeting ambassadors is a key part of the sovereign's role, with foreign representatives expected to visit the Queen to present their credentials when they arrive in the UK. Those returning home are also expected to call on the monarch and present her with their official letters of recall before leaving. While this is the first time that the Duke has joined the Queen for audiences, he has already begun to conduct investiture ceremonies, a role only performed by the monarch or direct heirs. Most memorable of his investitures so far was one that took place last month, in which he presented Dragon's Den star James Caan with a CBE and admitted to being a fan of the BBC show.

Photographer Hulia Boz, from Sydney, was on an impromptu two-week holiday to the remote region costing around $13,000 after being invited along by friends who had a spare place on their trip. She\u2019d loaded her iPad up with episodes of American comedian Ellen DeGeneres\u2019s chat show to entertain her while travelling to Antarctica and had been watching a Robin Williams episode with her fellow travellers in the moments before she lost her camera. Packed around her tiny screen on a remote iceberg, surrounded by nothing but ice, snow, penguins and seals, Ms Boz and her tour group then decided to record a message to Ellen on her white Canon camera. \u2018We spent an open night on an iceberg, the only thing around us were penguins and seals lazing around. I took the camera out of my pocket and said \u201ceveryone let\u2019s do a very Merry Christmas from Antarctica to Ellen because she\u2019s entertaining us at the bottom of the earth\u201d,\u2019 Ms Boz explained. 'Nothing like a selfie to help identify a lost camera!': This is the distinctive photo that helped tour operator staff identify Hulia Boz from the photos on her lost camera . Moments after recording the festive message on December 12, on day seven of her trip to Earth's southernmost continent, Ms Boz got up to go to the \u2018bathroom\u2019. \u2018You\u2019ve got to build a wall from ice to go to the toilet. I went to do my wee and the camera must have fallen out of my pocket, I didn\u2019t realise,\u2019 she said. The 34-year-old was unaware that she\u2019d lost her white camera in the snow until she boarded the ship the next day and began unpacking her belongings. \u2018The ship started to pull away and I thought \u201cwhere is the camera? Where is the camera?\u201d and we thought \u201cno we were going to send it to Ellen!\u201d,\u2019 Ms Boz laughed. The story of how Ms Boz is now being reunited with her camera, which was white and camouflaged in the snow, is nothing short of a miracle. Before departing on the ship to Antarctica, Ms Boz and the rest of her tour group had mugshots taken at the port in Ushuaia, Argentina \u2013 the southernmost city in the world - where they sailed from. All tourists heading to Antarctica have these photos taken so they can be officially identified if need be. Photographer Hulia Boz, from Sydney, was on an impromptu two-week holiday to Antarctica when she lost her camera. She took the white Canon camera along on her trip so she could capture 'silly' photos and used her professional cameras for landscape photography . This picture shows Hulia's friend cosying up with a seal in Antarctica. Her friend took photos on her camera and shared them with Hulia when her camera was lost . She was lucky enough to get a spare place on the trip which cost her around $13,000 after being invited along by friends . Hulia and her fellow tourists were watching an Ellen DeGeneres episode before she lost her camera . A traveller with a different tour company, Quark Expeditions, miraculously found Ms Boz\u2019s camera in the snow on the same iceberg near Useful Island in February and took it back to the port in Ushuaia, where they handed it in. Polar Operations Manager for Aurora travel Tomas Holik was given the camera \u2018with no marking nor name on it\u2019 and looked through the pictures stored on it, leading him to figure out that it belonged to Ms Boz as he compared the photos to the mugshots taken from recent expeditions. 'Once they saw all the young faces in the recording they found a voyage that happened to have young people on it.... they then sent my selfie to the ship's team leaders asking if they knew who I was,' Ms Boz explained. \u2018By looking at its pictures I figured out that it belongs to a passenger of EAP27,\u2019 Mr Holik wrote in an email to the Sydney-based tour company that Ms Boz travelled with. Before Hulia knew that she would ever be reunited with her lost camera her friend sent her these photos that she had taken of her . The 34-year-old was unaware that she\u2019d lost her white camera in the snow until she boarded the ship the next day and began unpacking her belongings . Amongst the many memories from her two-week trip where plenty of fun selfies taken in the stunning snowy environment . The group were camping out on an iceberg in  Useful Island in December when she lost her camera . Assistant expedition leader Robyn Mundy replied: \u2018I am amazed and astonished that someone found the camera. And returned it! We looked for it on the following voyage but there was still too much snow cover to find a white camera.\u2019 \u2018It does indeed belong to one of our EAP27 passengers, Hulia Boz. Nothing like a selfie to help identify a lost camera! If you could possibly get it back to Sydney via a staff member or passenger, I\u2019m sure Hulia will be eternally grateful,\u2019 Ms Mundy replied. Ms Boz\u2019s camera, which amazingly still works, is now on its way back to Sydney. \u2018When they told me the person\u2019s flight details and the name I thought this is really real. I hadn\u2019t put out a plea on social media because there is nothing there but ice and penguins,' she said. Packed around her tiny screen on a remote iceberg, surrounded by nothing but ice, snow, penguins and seals, Ms Boz and her tour group then decided to record a message to Ellen on her white Canon camera . Hulia still intends to send the Christmas message to Ellen once her camera returns to her, even if it is a bit late . This photo shows the ship that the group travelled from Argentina to Antarctica in over four days . Hulia has called the trip and the surprise of someone finding her camera in the remote snow 'the most over whelming experience of my life' 'The effort, patience and goodwill that was put into reuniting me with my memories by strangers has amazed me. It has restored my faith in humanity. 'My camera was identified as my property by a selfie I had taken and the footage my friends and I had taken to send to Ellen DeGeneres as that was the last thing on the camera . 'I am one lucky person who is grateful and overwhelmed by this all. Miracles do happen. Even if Antarctica is twice as big as Australia. Even with no permanent residence. Even if the colour of my camera was white and would be difficult to detect on ice,' she said happily. 'This truly was and probably will be the most over whelming experience of my life. I met some amazing talented people who I shared some very special memories with, built friendships for life, did some crazy things and most of all have one amazing story to tell my grand kids one day.'", "reference": "Photographer Hulia Boz, from Sydney, travelled to\u00a0Antarctica\u00a0via Argentina in December .\nShe lost her white camera, which she was using to take fun selfies, on day seven of the two week trip .\nShe only learned it had fallen out of her pocket once she was back on the ship .\nNow three months later her camera is being returned to her after another tourist found it on the same iceberg .\nMoments before she lost it Ms Boz had recorded a Christmas message to chat show host Ellen DeGeneres .\n'I am one lucky person who is grateful and overwhelmed by this all.

He was was told by the judge to get his anger under control and to change his behavior during a hearing on Thursday at Clay Count family court. The teen will be assessed by Missouri youth workers to determine what kind of treatment he will receive while in the custody of the state-run agency, which is for youths placed by juvenile courts, according to the Kansas City Star.

In the February 19 attack, Blake (above) was knocked unconscious and suffered from a cracked skull, a fractured jaw and damage to his ear after the incident in the lunchroom at Liberty Middle School . 'They can pretty much tailor a program to each individual kid based on their needs,' said Janet Rogers, interim juvenile officer for Clay County.

In the February 19 attack, Blake was knocked unconscious and suffered from\u00a0a cracked skull, a fractured jaw and damage to his ear after the incident in the lunchroom at Liberty Middle School. Blake has Asperger's syndrome, a mild form of autism, and likes to sit at the same spot each day in the Liberty Middle School cafeteria. His parents said that turned troublesome when last month, a boy moved Blake's belongings from his seat. When Blake asked the boy to move, another boy began hitting him. 'Then I blacked out,' Blake told WDAF. 'My ear hurts, my jaw hurts, my back hurts and that's all.' Blake (pictured left and right) has Asperger's syndrome, a mild form of autism, and likes to sit at the same spot each day in the Liberty Middle School cafeteria. The altercation occurred after some other schoolchildren moved his stuff in the cafeteria one morning . Blake's mother, Destiny, said the boy continued to beat her son even after he had blacked out, but she said luckily he does not remember the attack, according to Fox2Now. 'He doesn't remember any of that. I guess that was a blessing. He was unconscious and doesn't remember being violently attacked. It's sad he didn't stop,' she said. 'Anytime they moved him he would vomit. Dry heaving constantly, just dry heaving. Him crying and saying it was so painful and he was afraid he was going to die. He was like 'I don't want to die'.' Blake spent five days at Children's Mercy Hospital and was later released. His injuries have left him facing a second surgery and he is still unable to return to school but is trying to keep up online. Prior to the incident, Blake's parents  sent a certified letter to the school's principal  complaining about the same boy bullying Blake's older brother. Programs have been put in place following the incident to address bullies and other serious issues, Liberty superintendent Jeremy Tucker (above) announced on Thursday . The Liberty School District is still evaluating the attack and bullying present in its schools (above Liberty Middle School) 'It could have been avoided,' said Destiny. She said that she hopes the teen gets the help that he needs so that he does not harm anyone else. The eighth grader was arrested and referred to juvenile court following the incident, said Liberty police Capt. Andy Hedrick. At the time of the hearing on Thursday, he was still in juvenile custody. During the proceeding, the teen's lawyer, Gregory Culotta, said the boy and his family are very sorry for what happened, according to\u00a0KMBC. He also mentioned that his client suffered at the hands of some bullying himself for nearly a year at school and on the bus. Culotta also disputed that there was ongoing bullying evident with the boy against Blake and his siblings.

Mark Jensen, editor of online fanzine themag.co.uk, said he had expected profits for the 2013-14 campaign to be closer to \u00a350m given the increase in income from television rights and the sale of Yohan Cabaye to Paris Saint-Germain for around \u00a320million.

Yanis Varoufakis is continuing to negotiate for a reduction in Greece's debt from the EU and has been doing a whistlestop tour of Europe in a bid to get support for his proposals. But the new finance minister has been hit by an allegation recently that he held up his middle finger when giving a speech about Greece's finances and Germany in 2013. Scroll down for video . Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has been accused of making an offensive gesture with his middle finger during a speech he gave in 2013 about the country's finances, and mentioning Germany . He is alleged to have made the offensive gesture before he was appointed as finance minister, and Varoufakis has denied sticking up his finger. The minister claims the footage has been doctored. A video of the speech appears to capture the offensive gesture. As he raises his finger, Varoufakis says: 'My proposal was that Greece should simply announce that it is defaulting, just like Argentina did, within the euro, in January 2010, and stick the finger to Germany and say well, you can now solve this problem by yourself.' The claims are likely to make a tense situation even more tricky for Varoufakis who has been trying to negotiate favourable terms for Greece to pay back its debt to the EU since the election of the radical left-wing party Syriza in January. Alexis Tsipras, leader of the radical left-wing party heading the new coalition, immediately demanded a renegotiation of Greece' \u00a3179 billion international bailout deal. Yanis Varoufakis has been under increasing pressure to secure a better loan repayment deal for Greece . The party has continued to describe itself as 'anti-austerity.' The call catapulted Varoufakis onto the European stage. Last month he visited George Osborne in London to garner support for the move and has been touring several European countries. Greece was likely to run out of money by March if a deal was not reached before the end of February and a four month extension to the bailout programme for Greece was agreed on a conditional basis. February 9 2010 \u2013 Greek Parliament approved first austerity package measures - \u00a0included a freeze in the salaries of all government employees, a 10% cut in bonuses, and cuts in overtime workers. March 3 2010 \u2013 Parliament passed a new major austerity package. Measures included: Pensions freezes, an increase in sales tax from 19% to 21%, rises in taxes on fuel, cigarettes and alcohol, rises in taxes on luxury goods, cuts in public sector pay. April 23 2010 \u2013 George Papandreou, Greece\u2019s prime minister formally requested an international bailout. The financing will come from an emergency aid package with the participation of European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund. May 2 2010 \u2013 Papandreou, the IMF, and euro-zone leaders agree to a \u20ac110 billion bailout package that would take effect over the next three years. The government announced the new austerity package measures. June 29 2011 \u2013 Parliament passed the new austerity package. October 20 2011 \u2013 Government passed the multi-austerity bill, amid protests and violent riots outside the parliament building. February 12 2012 \u2013 Parliament passed new austerity package measures amid violent protests. Many buildings in the centre of Athens burnt during riots. November 5 2012 \u2013 Parliament adopted new round of austerity cuts required for Greece to receive the next installment of the international economic bailout. April 28 013 \u2013 Parliament approved bill that included cutting 15,000 state jobs . July 17 2013 \u2013 Parliament approves new austerity measures . March 30 2014 \u2013 Parliament passed new multi-bill needed for Greece to receive its next bailout. April 10 2014 \u2013 Greece returned to financial markets, with the issue of 3 billion Eurobonds. December 8 2014 \u2013 Greek government announced snap presidential vote. Next day the Greek stock market fell 12.78%, a fall record since 1989. December 29 2014 \u2013Government collapses after failing to elect new president of Greece. January 2015 - Alexis Tsipras of Syriza becomes prime minister and launches attempt to persuade European Union and IMF to ease terms of bail-outs. But there are still concerns the country could run out of money, as Greek officials complain the repayment measures are starving them of money. It was confirmed today that Greece had handed over 580m euros to the International Monetary Fund - clearing its debt for this month. But it will face another 350m euros bill on Friday - generating further tensions between Greece and the eurozone and fears that the country could drop out of the single currency altogether. The allegations come as Varoufakis, an outspoken Marxist economist and blogger, has faced a number of criticisms.

Jai Harms, 17, from Waterlooville, Hants shed an incredible 10st by ditching a diet of fast food and his games consoles to train five hours a day. His weight had ballooned to a staggering 20st 7lb by his 14th birthday when he feasted on a diet of bacon rolls, snacks and Chinese takeaways every night. At 14 Jai Harms weighed over 20st but just three years later the teenager has lost half of his body weight . Now three years on Jai's waistline has dropped from 46in to 28in and the determined teen is now nine months into a course at the Military Preparation College in Portsmouth, spending half the day on physical training. Jai says that before he decided to turn his life around he had very little respect for his own body existing of greasy takeaways. 'It was pretty bad - I would eat what I want, when I wanted. 'I would make regular trips to McDonald's and order McFlurrys and milkshakes with my meals and my lunch was normally four bacon rolls. 'My dad used to work for a Chinese restaurant too as he delivered food and at the end of the every day we used to get free meals.' As well as a bad diet Jai would be immobile for hours of the day devoting his time to video gaming. Jai slimmed down in order to fulfill his dream of joining the marines and now trains everyday . Before he began his weight loss Jai would spend 12 hours a day playing games on his Xbox . 'When I was in school I barely moved. I would just sit around and play on my Xbox for 12 hours a day, probably more, from the moment I woke up until I went to bed. 'I would play car racing games and FIFA football but I don't even look at the Xbox now.' Jai was bullied over his weight at school but decided to turn his life around on New Year's Eve 2011 when he told his mum Andrea, 48, he wanted to take up boxing. Three months later she and his father Neil, 51, gave him permission to start and Jai started training at his local club once a week. When Jai stepped on a set of scales he discovered his weight had reached an unhealthy 20-and-a-half stone. Jai decided to ditch the computer games when he wanted to take up boxing and is now a champion for his age . Before joining the military college Jai lived off four bacon rolls for his lunch and a Chinese takeaway every night, but now the 17-year-old survives off a high protein diet . Shocked into action Jai soon started running three times a week in addition to his boxing and started to lose between one and two kilos a week. When he enrolled at the Military Preparation College (MPCT) the weight kept dropping off and he has now even been crowned as the Hampshire and Isle of Wight boxing champion for his age group. Jai said:\u00a0'I always wanted to look like Floyd Mayweather the boxer - he's my biggest inspiration in life. 'I also watched a lot of TV programmes about people wanting to lose weight, like A Year To Save My Life, and thought \"if they can do it, then I can do it\". He added that he couldn't have got to where he is today without the help of his loving parents. 'My parents are really supportive and are constantly pushing me - mum has made me healthy lunches and dad has been there training me from the start.' Jai now feasts mainly on pasta and chicken and three protein shakes a day in between his busy schedule of five hours worth of military training and gym work a day. He can now run an impressive 1.5 miles in just eight minutes thanks to his marine training. During a 27-week course at the Military Preparation College, a student will typically run 170 miles, do 9,500 press ups, 9,500 burpees, 9,500 squats and 9,500 sit ups . Jai says that as well as his parents support he has found an equally supportive team at the Military College. 'Everyone is so supportive at the Military Preparation College, so I knew there was no need for me to worry about joining. 'Of course it is challenging at times but we're all one big family and everyone helps each other get to where they want to be. Jai is now using his skills to help others to get fit at the military college . 'In the space of a few months after joining I was at where I wanted to be. Not only has my physical strength and fitness increased massively, but my mental strength, too.' Aside from improving his fitness Jai is also working on his academic skills. 'I am now much more confident, organised and am improving on my maths and English too. 'My friends and family are so proud and they don't stop telling me how well I've done, especially my dad, my military instructors and my boxing coaches.' Jai is also hoping to use what he has learnt to help others in the same position that he was once in. 'All the students here are amazing. 'One lad at the college reminds me a lot of my former self. I work with him in the gym and physical training to help him get where he wants to be.' The next steps for Jai now are completing his MPCT course, and applying to the Royal Marine commando unit. The Military Preparation College is free to attend and open to any 16 to 19-year-olds who want to get fit, boost their self-confidence and prepare themselves for life, including in the armed forces. During a 27-week course, a student will typically run 170 miles, do 9,500 press ups, 9,500 burpees, 9,500 squats and 9,500 sit ups. There are 16 free colleges around the UK, with new students joining on a weekly basis. Nathan Gibbons, Head of Physical Literacy at MPCT, says that he has been extremely impressed with Jai's progress. 'It's amazing to see how Jai has turned his life by getting fit, healthy and motivated. 'He's now one of the fittest learners we have at MPCT Portsmouth and a real inspiration to everyone at the College. 'He is living proof that with the right amount of hard work, determination and support, young people can achieve incredible things.'", "reference": "At 14 Jai Harms was addicted to his Xbox and weighed in at over 20st .\nDesperate to become a marine he ditched takeaways and started training .\nNow he's halved his body weight and become a local boxing champion ."}, "196": {"id": "f1d0be0570967466b1807855912a01c5c360c89f", "article": "Following his apology over his rough treatment of the Cologne club mascot - a goat -\u00a0forward Anthony Ujah showed there were no hard feelings as he celebrated Hennes VIII's birthday.

The product, called Palcohol, had received the greenlight from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau briefly last year before the bureau backtracked and said the label approvals had been given in error. On Wednesday, bureau spokesman Tom Hogue told The Associated Press the issues were resolved and that four varieties of Palcohol were approved. But Hogue noted that states can also regulate alcohol sales in their borders. Dry booze: A brand of powdered alcohol has been approved by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. The maker of Palcohol hopes to start selling the product by summer. A few of their flavors of powdered alcohol seen above . The approval is a step forward for a small company whose product plans have already sparked controversy. Several states have already moved to ban powdered alcohol, including lawmakers in Colorado who last month advanced legislation to temporarily halt its sale. That bill has since morphed to ensure the regulation of powdered alcohol as if it were liquid alcohol once it gets federal approval. Concerns have included abuse by minors, the potential to snort the powder and whether Palcohol's light weight would make it easy to sneak alcohol into public events or spike drinks. Palcohol would come in a pouch, with water being added to the powder inside for the equivalent of an alcoholic drink. A statement on Palcohol's website says the company hopes to have the product for sale this summer. Palcohol founder Mark Phillips noted the approval of his products in an email early Wednesday morning, and said in a subsequent email that pricing hasn't yet been determined. 'We aren't commenting on production or distribution at this time,' he wrote. The four products that have been approved include powdered versions of a cosmopolitan, a margarita, vodka and rum. Phillips added that he expects another Palcohol product \u2014 Lemon Drop \u2014 should also be 'approved shortly.' Previously, Phillips had said he came up with the idea for Palcohol because he wanted a way to enjoy alcoholic drinks after hiking or other activities without having to lug around heavy bottles. Hogue said the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau regularly reaches out to the Food and Drug Administration to get determinations on whether a product might be considered 'adulterated.' If the FDA says the product isn't adulterated, he said the bureau's evaluation centers on whether labels accurately reflect what's in the product. 'Potential for abuse isn't grounds for us to deny a label,' Hogue said.", "reference": "A powdered alcohol brand called Palcohol was approved by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau .\nWhile powdered alcohol has federal approval, individual states have the power to ban it within their borders .\nThe maker of Palcohol hopes to start selling the product this summer ."}, "198": {"id": "c99c8dbb3f5034113449af2946024ae923a457b9", "article": "A Masterchef contestant who built a restaurant in a hut in her back garden may have to pull it down after failing to get planning permission.

Randall Miller pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespass Monday morning in Wayne County (Georgia) Superior Court, Deputy Clerk of Courts Betty Taylor said. The National Transportation Safety Board announced on March 24 the probable cause of the accident was trespassing by the film's crew. As part of the plea deal, Miller will spend two years behind bars and then serve eight years of probation. The deal prohibits him from directing films or being in any supervisory position in movies that would make him responsible for the safety of others for a period of 10 years. Miller, who was also ordered to pay $20,000 in fines and perform 360 hours of community service, was remanded in to custody of the sheriff to begin his sentence. A freight train hit members of the crew of the Gregg Allman biopic while they were working on a railroad bridge in February 2014. Camera assistant Sarah Elizabeth Jones, 27, was killed. The production had applied to the railroad company for permission to film on the bridge but was denied, according to the Savannah Morning News. Several other crew members were injured in the incident, CNN affiliate WTOC reported. 'Midnight Rider' pair surrender to authorities . Jones was mourned throughout  the film community. Friends set up a Facebook group, Slates for Sarah, and her death was noted in the Academy Awards' \"In Memoriam\" montage. Three additional members of the production staff faced charges related to the incident. As part of the plea agreement with Miller, charges were dropped against Jody Savin, Miller's wife and business partner, Taylor said. Miller and Savin are listed as owners of Unclaimed Fright Productions Inc., the film's production company, according to the indictment. Jay Sedrish, the film's executive producer, also received 10 years of probation. As part of his plea deal, he will be banned from supervisory positions in films for 10 years. He was also ordered to pay a fine of $10,000. A third member of the crew, first assistant director Hillary Schwartz, was found guilty after a bench trial, according to District Attorney Jackie Johnson's office. Schwartz was sentenced to 10 years of probation and ordered to pay a fine of $5,000. Like the others, he was ordered not to be involved in the safety of film crews. Schwartz had made a deal to provide testimony for the state if the case went to trial, according to the district attorney's office. Jones' parents were in court for the pleas and the trial of those involved in the death of their daughter, addressing the court before the sentencing of each, according to Johnson's office.

For Wisconsin residents decrying the death of unarmed teen Tony Robinson, the question isn't even an issue. \"The investigation is being conducted by the state. We have a new law here in Wisconsin where departments are no longer conducting their own internal investigations for officer-involved shootings,\" Madison Mayor Paul Soglin said. In fact, Wisconsin is one of only two states with such legislation. The other is Connecticut. And that brings some comfort to Robinson's family. \"I trust Wisconsin and the way they're handling the investigation,\" Robinson's uncle Turin Carter told reporters. \"We spoke to investigators from DCI (Department of Criminal Investigation). We trust them, and we trust them to handle this with integrity and to treat it as it comes. We don't want our biases involved, we don't want anybody else's. We want them to act strictly as fact-finders, and that's what we believe in, and we have confidence in that.\" Wisconsin's law, which was enacted just last April, requires \"an investigation that is conducted by at least two investigators ... neither of whom is employed by a law enforcement agency that employs a law enforcement officer involved in the officer-involved death.\" After that, investigators must provide a report to the district attorney. If the district attorney determines there are no grounds to prosecute the officer involved, then the investigators must release their report to the public. Connecticut's law requires the state's Division of Criminal Justice with investigating any deadly force by law enforcement, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The state's chief attorney can appoint a special prosecutor, and the law also allows anyone to make a written request to the chief attorney to appoint a special prosecutor, the NCSL said. After that, Connecticut's Division of Criminal Justice must submit a report to the state's chief attorney detailing whether the use of deadly force was appropriate. While such laws are rather novel, a dozen other states have proposed measures about appointing special prosecutors for, or providing independent investigation in, officer-involved deaths, according to the NCSL. They include California, Connecticut, New York, Texas, Missouri, Minnesota, West Virginia, Kansas, Illinois, Tennessee, Mississippi, Oklahoma. \"Typically it doesn't work when you have to police yourself,\" said Mel Robbins, a CNN legal analyst who has began her career as a New York City public defender and now practices criminal law for Legal Aid Criminal Defense Society. \"This is why we have whistle blower protective statutes because people inside an organization will do everything they can to shut that person up. \"Having laws that require an outside agency to investigate would actually help police and prosecutors,\" she said. \"There's a suspicion that many have that police are corrupt. Many are not, but that is the perception. To begin to address that, these laws are needed.\" She noted the case of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old Cleveland boy who was playing with a pellet gun when an officer shot him dead in November 2014. After they were pressured from the child's family and the public, the police released  surveillance footage that showed that officers who arrived on the scene before the shooting did not administer first aid to the boy. Robbins thinks it's best to let a unit of prosecutors within the attorney general's office to review police-involved shootings rather than create an entirely new outside agency. CNN legal analyst and former New York City prosecutor Paul Callan said there are several reasons why outside entities, such as special prosecutors, aren't tasked with reviewing police shootings. \"Traditionally, elected district attorneys think they've done a fair and reasonable job with cases,\" he said. \"And frankly they perceive (appointment of a special prosecutor) as an insult and an attack on their integrity. It implies they are incapable of investigating police.\"There are \"powerful political forces lobbying against this kind of legislation,\" Callan said. It's also very costly to create parallel investigative structures just for police shootings, he said, and when budgets are already stretched thin, the idea of creating a new bureaucracy isn't appealing. Callan also noted the possibility that the appointment of a special prosecutor could work against minorities in certain situations. \"For the first time we are seeing minorities coming to political power in large U.S. cities and getting to the point where they can elect African-American or Hispanic district attorneys,\" he said. \"If a special prosecutor is appointed by a governor -- maybe a governor who is white who would appoint someone who is white -- does that really work to answer the call (for justice)? In the end you could have minorities deprived of power and not treated fairly by the system.\" Though Wisconsin's law has been in place for less than a year, it has already been applied in another officer-related killing. Milwaukee police officer Christopher Manney shot Dontre Hamilton, a mentally ill man, more than a dozen times last April.  The officer said he opened fire when Hamilton grabbed his baton and struck him with it. Manney was not charged in the death, but he was fired for not following protocol. Robinson's death stirred memories of two other unarmed men killed by police: Michael Brown, who was shot by officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner, who died at the hands of New York police officer Daniel Pantaleo. But there are stark differences between Robinson's case and the two others. After Brown's death in August, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson asked the neighboring St. Louis County Police Department to investigate. The case was not investigated by the state and was referred to a grand jury -- just like  in Garner's case. \"The decisions of grand juries not to indict the officers involved in the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown raised two primary concerns,\" the NCSL said. \"First, many were worried that since the evidence on which grand juries base their assessment is sealed, there is no opportunity for public scrutiny of their decisions. \"Second, there was apprehension over the decision not to appoint a special prosecutor in either case. Some are concerned that police may receive favorable treatment due to the close proximity in which law enforcement and district attorneys work.\" Robinson's case won't just by handled by state investigators; it'll go through another layer of scrutiny by the district attorney's office, Koval said. \"The State of Wisconsin's Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI) has the exclusive authority to investigate all elements of the officer involved shooting -- forensics, interviews, technology feeds, etc.,\" Koval wrote on his official blog. \"This investigation is then turned directly over to the second layer of review, the District Attorney's Office, who then makes a ruling on the question of whether there is criminal culpability on the part of my officer.\" After the deaths of Brown and Garner, President Barack Obama announced the \"Task Force on 21st Century Policing,\" aimed at strengthening trust between communities and officers and identifying which practices can be improved. The task force's interim report, released this month, calls for independent investigations and independent special prosecutors in officer-related deaths. \"The importance of making sure that the sense of accountability when, in fact, law enforcement is involved in a deadly shooting is something that I think communities across the board are going to need to consider,\" Obama said. \"We have a great opportunity, coming out of some great conflict and tragedy, to really transform how we think about community law enforcement relations so that everybody feels safer and our law enforcement officers feel, rather than being embattled, feel fully supported.\" CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet, Julie In and Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.", "reference": "Wisconsin state investigators -- not local police -- will investigate Tony Robinson's killing by officer .\nWisconsin and Connecticut are the only states that require independent probes in such cases .\n12 states have pending legislation requiring outside entities to examine police involved shootings ."}, "202": {"id": "1a07ab0ae7d5911c70930cd5640745d7f675638c", "article": "A bizarre green 'fireball' left residents in Colorado baffled after appearing in the sky for more than ten seconds.

The Mayor of London spoke with pride of his\u00a0resilient judo-loving gran, who spent years in the depths of Exmoor National Park in Devon. His paternal grandmother Irene, who was also known as Buster, shunned the glamour of London to move to the countryside with her husband to start a simple life.

From left Johnny, Birdie, Stanley, Buster and Peter with Hilary in the front . Mrs Johnson and her husband Johnny swapped a blissful life of domestic servants and bridge parties for a remote existence at a farm, West Nethercote. Boris, writing a foreword in a book about his grandmother's life, said Mrs Johnson cooked in cheap pots in a kitchen which used to be a cow shed - but still served him dishes which have stayed with him all his life. She wrote the book before her death in 1987, but it is only being published now. The Mayor of London wrote: 'She had no collection of fancy saucepans, no Sabatier knives - and yet she produced dishes whose tastes and smells I can remember today, almost half a century later, with Proust-like rapture. 'I am not sure that she was ever really taught to cook. She was born in the Pavillon du Barry at Versailles; she went to Cheltenham Ladies College; she read Russian and got half a blue for judo at Oxford. 'No, I don't think cooking featured much on her early curriculum. It would be fair to say that her kitchen - a converted cow-byre - was not exactly a chef's paradise. 'When the concrete floor needed cleaning, Granny would get a handful of wet tea leaves, hurl them into the dusty corners, and sweep up the gloop with a broom.' Mrs Johnson wrote the book before her death in 1987.

Boris, who is running to become an MP in the upcoming General Election, reveals some of his earliest memories of life on the Exmoor plains with his beloved grandmother, who lived in the West Country until her death. The book, Alas Poor Johnny, is named after Buster's husband Johnny - a warm and friendly man said to have influenced Boris' unique sense of humour. A spokesman for publishers Troubador said: 'In 1951, Buster Johnson moved from Surrey to Exmoor with her husband Johnny, four children, two dogs and a van load of pigs and poultry. 'Alas Poor Johnny, written some 10 years later, is her account of their life there, and of farming on Exmoor in the fifties, told with a strong sense of drama and of the absurd. 'Above all, her life is filled by the animals, taking the place of absent friends in her affections. 'There's also a small but strong supporting cast, including busybody Mrs Stevens at the next door farm; Arthur the ex-cowman who moves with them from Surrey; SRN Tommie, the butt of an aggressive ram - and Alby the rabbit catcher, who plays the mouth organ and thrills the children.'

Far from their idyllic life in Surrey, Exmoor provided no electricity, no running water and no indoor toilet. In a postscript for the book, Boris' aunt Birdie, who decided to publish her mother's book, said: 'As my mother hoped, over the years Nethercote has remained a constant in the lives of her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, wherever we are. 'It is a place which, for those who have spent time there, becomes ingrained in our DNA. It may sometimes, as she experienced, be hard to live there; but it is always hard to leave.'

Jeff McDonald had gone out hunting for deer near his home in Manning, Oregon, when he saw Linus Norgren wearing what appeared to be 'tan clothing'. But when he got closer, Mr McDonald, who was carrying a high-powered rifle, realized that 22-year-old Norgren was in fact naked.

He told Oregon Live how he asked him for his name and received a normal response before Norgren said that he was 'a sasquatch from a family of sasquatches'. After offering to help take him home, Norgren struck Mr McDonald on the head with a rock, causing him to black out. When he woke up, Oregon Live reports, Norgren was on top of him and squeezing his hands tightly around his neck while Mr McDonald had suffered two dislocated shoulders. As the struggle unfolded he asked his attacker why he was trying to kill him to which Norgren replied: 'Sasquatch kills the hunter'. Mr McDonald said he managed to bite one of Mr Norgren's knuckles before the attacker appeared to 'pass out' on top of him. After a further struggle he managed to free himself and reach his gun, according to reports. Pointing his rifle at Norgren, he called 911. According to KPTV, McDonald told authorities they needed to get there quick, 'because I only have one option here and you know what it is'. Deputies eventually found them in thick forest after a 90 minute search. McDonald had held Norgren at gunpoint the whole time. Jeff McDonald had gone out hunting for deer near his home in Manning (pictured), Oregon, when he saw Linus Norgren wearing what appeared to be 'tan clothing' In court this week, Norgren said he was suffering 'catastrophic mental disturbances' at the time.

'I was injured already, I was naked and I was terrified,' Norgren said in court Tuesday, KPTV reported. 'Not to make excuses for myself, but Mr. McDonald's presence was absolutely terrifying. 'I truly believed I needed to defend myself to get out of that situation and go home. 'I didn't want to hurt him, I didn't want to hurt Mr. McDonald. 'I didn't want to kill him. I didn't want anything to happen to either of us.' 'I couldn't help it.' Guilty: Norgren was found guilty of attempted murder and second-degree assault last week. On Tuesday, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison with credit for time already served . But the self defence argument was rejected by jurors and Norgren was convicted of attempted murder and three counts of second-degree assault. He was cleared of further charges of first degree assault and unlawful use of a weapon. Oregon Live reports that his defense lawyer said he was unable to use an 'insanity defense' without Norgren's consent but suggested the evidence of mental illness should be a 'mitigating factor'.

Tunisia -- lying just across the Mediterranean from Europe, but bordered on one side by Libya and on the other by Algeria -- has until now not suffered the kind of large-scale terror attacks seen in both those nations in recent years. But it has emerged as a place of increasing concern as the threat of Islamist extremism has intensified in the region. Islamist terrorists also have struck in Algeria, where they killed at least 37 hostages at a gas field in 2013, and in Libya, where terrorists killed the U.S. ambassador and three others in 2012 and where ISIS has established a beachhead in the east. Al Qaeda's North African offshoot Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which has its roots in Algeria, has captured territory in Mali and taken hostages -- often Europeans -- in countries such as Niger and Mauritania. So what is the world doing about it? The United States has created a military command in Africa and also established a special operations base in Djibouti, which borders Somalia in the Horn of Africa. France has sent troops to Mali. And, as CNN recently reported from Chad, Western militaries have trained special forces from several northern African nations to take on the Islamists. Here's a country-by-country look -- although not exhaustive -- at how Islamist extremism has reared its head across a swath of Africa. Algeria is home to a long-running Islamist insurgency. In perhaps the highest-profile incident, Islamist militants attacked the In Amenas oil and gas plant in southern Algeria in January 2013. At least 37 hostages, including three U.S. citizens, died in the seizure of, and ensuing special forces assault on, the remote facility. Dozens of assailants also died in the days-long siege. The attack was the work of the Mulathameen Brigade, which translates as the \"Signatories in Blood Brigade.\" Last September, another Islamist group beheaded a 55-year-old French hiker, Herve Gourdel, after seizing him as he walked in Djudjura National Park in central Algeria. Days earlier, the outfit -- Jund al Khilafa, a splinter group of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -- had pledged allegiance to ISIS. Militants affiliated with AQIM had previously also kidnapped foreigners in Algeria, including Italians and Spaniards. In 2007, AQIM launched a suicide bombing campaign in Algeria, which included a deadly bombing against the U.N. headquarters in Algiers. In January, a suicide bombing and gun attack on a hotel in the capital, Tripoli, killed 10 people, including an American. The attack was swiftly claimed by Wilayat al-Tarabulus, ISIS' name for the province. Politicians in Tripoli disputed the claim. Besides its growing presence in Tripoli, ISIS is now the dominant force in Derna in eastern Libya and controls parts of the town center of Sirte, the hometown of former Libya strongman Moammar Gadhafi. Before the advent of ISIS, an Islamist group called Ansar al Shariah was blamed by the United States for carrying out the September 11,  2012, attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi in which Ambassador Christopher Stevens was killed. State Department computer expert Sean Smith and former U.S. Navy SEALs Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, then acting as security contractors, also died. In 2012, Islamist extremists capitalized on chaos in Mali after a military coup and uprising by Tuareg tribesmen to seize control of a large piece of northern Mali, an area the size of France. France intervened militarily in early 2013 and helped to push back the Islamists. Since then, Mali's government has battled various rebel factions, mostly in its northern region, with the help of French and African forces. Recent attacks include a shooting earlier this month at a bar popular with expatriates in the capital, Bamako, which killed five people, including French and Belgian citizens, authorities said. A North African jihadist group, al-Murabitun, claimed responsibility for the attack, according to Mauritanian news agency Al Akhbar. AQIM issued a warning to France via jihadist websites in January, following terror attacks in Paris, stating that \"France pays the cost of its violence on Muslim countries and the violation of their sanctity,\" citing the presence of its soldiers in Mali. According to analysis by Jane's Defence Weekly, despite the shift of jihadist activity east toward Libya, \"Mauritania is still an aspirational target for jihadist groups due to its military co-operation with France and Algeria.\" Jihadist groups including AQIM and the Mulathameen Brigade operate in the porous border areas between Mauritania, Algeria, Mali, Niger and Libya. Militants have in the past kidnapped foreign workers for ransom, including three Spaniards in 2011, according to Jane's. However, since 2011 jihadist activity in the country has declined. Mauritanian troops joined the fight against AQIM militants in Mali. Militant group Boko Haram has waged a campaign of terror in mostly northern Nigeria for over a decade. It has attacked the country's police, military, banks, bus stations and crowded markets, as well carrying out a string of church bombings. Perhaps the most notorious incident came last April, when Boko Haram militants kidnapped more than 200 teenage girls from a boarding school in Chibok, in Borno state. Most of the girls remain missing. In January this year, hundreds of Boko Haram gunmen seized the town of Baga and neighboring villages in northern Nigeria, as well as a multinational military base, leaving bodies scattered everywhere and as many as 2,000 people feared dead. The group's stated aim is to institute Sharia, or Islamic law. Earlier this month, in an audio message purportedly from leader Abubakar Shekau, Boko Haram pledged allegiance to ISIS. It had previously declared ties to AQIM. Al-Shabaab started with a goal of waging a war against the Somali government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or Sharia. It has since shifted focus to terrorist attacks in Somalia and beyond, notably neighboring Kenya. Its most high-profile attack came in that country in 2013, when gunmen struck at Nairobi's upscale Westgate mall, pulling out weapons and gunning down shoppers. The gunmen were accused of torturing some hostages before killing them. As many as 67 people died in the siege. The group has carried out numerous attacks in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, and elsewhere. Just last week, its target was government offices in the city of Baidoa. It has also recently called for attacks on shopping malls in the United States, Canada and Britain. The Pentagon said this week that a key Al-Shabaab operative connected to the Westgate mall attack, named as Adan Garar, was killed recently by a U.S. drone strike. In September, Al-Shabaab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane was also killed in a U.S. airstrike near Barawe city. Gunmen who besieged the Bardo Museum in Tunis are thought to have claimed 23 lives, most of them foreign tourists. Interior Ministry spokesman Mohamed Ali Aroui told national radio that the assailants were Islamists, but authorities haven't been more specific than that. Nine arrests have been made in connection with the attack. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack in an audio message posted online Thursday. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the audio statement. The attack occurred even as the country's democratically elected Parliament was meeting to discuss new anti-terror legislation. Up to 3,000 Tunisians are believed to have traveled to Iraq and Syria to fight as jihadists, more than any other country, according to the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization in London. The fear is that many of these fighters will return to North Africa to join ISIS-affiliated groups there and carry out attacks. Al Qaeda's North African affiliate is also a threat. In late 2012, AQIM set up a branch in Tunisia called the Uqba ibn Nafi Brigade, a 60-strong Jihadi outfit composed of Tunisians, Algerians, and some Libyans. The group, believed to include fighters driven out of Mali by French forces, has been responsible for a string of attacks on Tunisian security services in mountainous Djebel Chaambi region along the Algerian border.

Jennifer Lopez does it too. And now Australian women are shelling out up to $3000 to learn how to do it. The Kardashians have turned the art of contouring, a technique that involves highlighting and shadowing the face, from a make up insider secret to something many women - and some men - have tried to master. The demand to learn the secret to a flawless face is so high in Australia that one Hollywood make up artist is in the country this week to teach sold-out workshops in Sydney and Melbourne. Scroll down for video . The Kardashian look: Australian women are embracing the contouring make up technique, which uses highlighting to 'sculpt' facial features . Behind the blush: Kim Kardashian is a huge fan of contouring, and revealed to fans what goes into her high maintenance make up look in this Instagram picture . Lilit Caradanian is a professional make up artist with a roster of celebrity clients and over 840,000 Instagram followers. The 30-year-old was flown here to teach the the techniques used by Kim Kardashian and Jennifer Lopez's 'glam squads' to groups of women who have shelled out up to $3000 each for a three-day master class. Lilit spoke to Daily Mail Australia during her Sydney workshop, which will be followed this week by more sold-out classes in Melbourne. Eager to learn: Australian women are embracing the trend, and some have shelled out up to $3000 for a master class this week to learn from a top Hollywood make up artist . Tricks of the trade: Make up artist Lilit Caradanian (pictured) says that '90 per cent' of her students and clients request contouring . 'Contouring is really popular over here,' she says. 'I always ask what the class wants to learn and right now contouring is 90 per cent of the feedback I get. 'My students who are make up artists tell me their clients come to them asking about contouring. The average consumer knows about contouring, but doesn\u2019t have the knowledge to do it themselves.' While the Kardashians are largely responsible for alerting the masses to the magic of contouring, Lilit credits Jennifer Lopez with pioneering the trend - even if her fans didn't know she was doing it at the time. 'JLo \u2013 it started with her. Scott Barnes, her former make up artist, created and then became a master of contouring,' Lilit says. 'And then he became Kim\u2019s make up artist, and she started carrying that look as well.' Makeover: Lilit shares her contouring technique with Daily Mail Australia . Before and after: The contouring technique can give the illusion of a different face shape, sculpted jawline and cheekbones . 1. Start with applying your foundation as normal . 2. Next take a peach-hued concealer, approximately two shades lighter than your skin and apply under the eyes to highlight, blending as you go . 3. Use the same concealer on the straight bridge of the nose, middle of the forehead and centre of the chin (think everywhere the light catches) and blend, blend, blend . 4. Next, take a contouring cream two shades darker than your foundation . Sculpt the face: Concealers, highlighters and contouring creams are used . 5. Swirl some of the contouring cream onto a brush and start by outlining around the hairline. This should look like you are \u2018framing\u2019 the face. Blend the contouring \u2018in\u2019 (starting from the outside of the face and blending inwards) 6. Finish the \u2018frame\u2019 by sweeping the colour under the jawline. 7. Trace the contour cream below the cheekbones, creating a triangle of colour that points to the corner of the lips . 8. Take some more colour and contour on either side of the bridge of the nose and also in the crease of the eyelid . 9. The final step is to blend, blend, blend using a foundation brush to ensure there are no firm lines . Illusion: Contouring can be used to slim a face, hide a double chin, and highlight cheek bones . So, what is contouring exactly? 'It\u2019s not just drawing lines on your face. It\u2019s about bringing out certain features we want and receding features we don\u2019t want to show so much,' Lilit tells DMA. 'If you have a double chin, you can contour it to make you look a little bit slimmer \u2013 it\u2019s an illusion. You\u2019re sculpting your features.' 'The ideal shaped face is the oval shape, so if you don\u2019t have that, you can contour your face in certain areas to create the illusion of the oval shape, and to bring out the features.' Lilit's clients have become savvy about contouring. 'A few years ago, when I\u2019d ask my clients what they want to do with their make up, they would say they wanted a smoky eye, some liner, lashes. Now it\u2019s just about contour. They don\u2019t care what you do with their eyes or lips, as long as they have contour. Pioneer: Jennifer Lopez was an early adopter of contouring . 'The bridal industry has taken this turn where the bride wants to feel like a celebrity the day of her wedding - all eyes on them. They want to feel like a Kardashian, they want to feel perfect.' Celebrities have embraced the art of contouring because it helps them photograph flawlessly. But how does it translate to real life? With heavy duty contouring taking up to an hour, Lilit says there are a few short cut methods that can be adapted for everyday. 'A woman shouldn\u2019t spend longer than 15 minutes getting ready in the morning. You don\u2019t need to highlight and contour every day. 'A simpler technique is with a powder bronzer, which you can use in the same way as a contour, it\u2019s easier, on the go, and you don\u2019t need to sit there and blend it for an hour. All you really need is some good base \u2013 tinted moisturiser or foundation, some bronzer so you don\u2019t look pale, blush, and you\u2019re good to go. In demand: Professional make up artist Lilit\u00a0Caradanian has over 840,000 Instagram followers and celebrity clients . There are a few different contouring methods, says Lilit. 'You can use heavier creams, which are great for photo shoots but not if you want your make up to last all day. There are also thinner, more liquid creams, which have more staying power.' And for Australia's humid climate, where woman are regularly victims to their carefully applied make up slipping off in the heat, Lilit recommends a powder base. 'For people with oily skin or if you live in a humid climate, you want to go with powder contouring versus cream contouring,' she advises. 'You\u2019re still going to get the same look, but with a lighter texture and feel on the skin.'

Alonso, who races for McLaren-Honda, crashed at 150mph on February 22 during pre-season testing and was rushed to hospital where he spent three days under observation. Asked by doctors who he was, what sort of work he was in and what he wanted to be in the future, he replied: 'I'm Fernando, I drive go karts and I want to be a Formula 1 driver,' it is claimed. Scroll down for video . Formula 1 ace Fernando Alonso waves to supporters as he leaves hospital on February 25 . McLaren-Honda claimed doctors found Alonso to be 'asymptomatic' with 'no evidence whatsoever of any injury'. Here he is pictured in hospital following the accident . Two days ago McLaren-Honda stated doctors had found the 33-year-old to be 'asymptomatic', with 'no evidence whatsoever of any injury' and 'entirely healthy from neurological and cardiac perspectives'. However, worrying reports in Spain's\u00a0El Pais\u00a0newspaper suggest his concussion was so severe when doctors asked him questions he thought it was 1995 and aged 13. The paper also claimed he could not remember his F1 debut in 2001, the victories of his beloved Real Madrid or his two world championship titles and it took him a week to recover these memories. Meanwhile, McLaren-Honda confirmed two days ago that he would be sitting out the start of the F1 season on doctors' advice. A spokesperson said: 'His doctors have advised that he should not compete in the imminent Australian Grand Prix meeting, which will take place on March 13th, 14th and 15th. 'Fernando has understood and accepted that advice, and the two McLaren-Honda cars will therefore be driven in Australia by Fernando\u2019s team-mate Jenson Button and the team\u2019s test and reserve driver Kevin Magnussen.' McLaren did not respond to MailOnline's request for comment. The Spaniard was then airlifted by helicopter to hospital following the crash, which happened during the final day of the Formula One pre-season test at the Circuit de Barcelona Catalunya. At the time, McLaren said the two-time former world champion was 'conscious and able to speak' while receiving first aid at the circuit's medical centre, but had been taken to hospital for 'precautionary checks'. After several hours of tests and observation, the team later added that Alonso was 'uninjured' but had suffered concussion in the accident, which took place just before turn four on the track.

Teenage years: Fernando Alonso, pictured here in 2001 at the age of 16, had forgotten 20 years of his life after being concussed in a pre-season crash last month . Although he was technically given a clean bill of health after sustaining concussion in the heavy crash, the fear of 'second-impact syndrome' forced him out of the start of the racing season. The term refers to a second concussion occurring when the effects of the first are still subsiding, potentially resulting in severe brain injuries, or even death. Although the timespan between the accident and Alonso returning to the car for first practice in Melbourne on March 13 would appear to be sufficient, he is not prepared to take any risks. Via his Twitter account, he said: 'It will be tough not to be in Australia, but I understand the recommendations. A second impact in less than 21 days 'NO' #countdownMalaysia.' Alonso tweeted his disappointment at not being able to make the season-opening F1 grand prix in Australia . For the Albert Park event his seat will be occupied by Kevin Magnussen, demoted to reserve driver following the Spaniard's arrival after a full season with the team in 2014. A thrilled Magnussen, who will partner Jenson Button in Melbourne, tweeted: 'Shame about the circumstances but still I'm so excited to be racing in Melbourne. Can't wait!!' Alonso rejoined McLaren this season after a disappointing fifth and final campaign with Ferrari. He won back-to-back world titles with Renault in 2005 and 2006 before spending one season at McLaren in 2007. Alonso has 32 career grand prix victories, the last of which came at Montmelo in 2013.

Ronald Fliegelman is said to have built explosives for the far-left group Weather Underground who ran a terrifying campaign across the country during the 1970s. But according to a new book seen byThe New York Post,\u00a0after avoiding prison on a technicality he managed to build a successful, 25-year career in the classroom after the group disbanded - and still hasn't served a day in prison. Ronald Fliegelman built explosives for the far-left group Weather Underground who ran a terrifying campaign across the country during the 1970s . Firefighters work at extinguishing the fire at a residence in Greenwich Village on March 6, 1970. Three members of the Weather Underground were killed when a bomb went off prematurely . Bryan Burrough's book, Days of Rage: America's Radical Underground, the FBI, and the Forgotten Age of Revolutionary Violence, states Fliegelman is now living a quiet life in Park Slope in Brooklyn after retiring. But the author, who also penned the books Public Enemies about America's crime wave in the 1930s and 40s, say's the culprit is not sorry for what he has done. Burroughs told The Post: 'Ron is proud of what he did.' The Weathermen, as they were popularly known, was set up in 1969 and run by the co-founder Bill Ayers. He went on to become a University of Chicago professor and his friendship with Barack Obama was questioned during the 2008 race for the White House. The Weathermen, as they were popularly known, was set up in 1969 and run by the co-founder Bill Ayers (pictured in 2013) The group was  mostly of white and middle class and advocated the overthrow of the US government. Their name was based on the Bob Dylan lyric: 'You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.' In 1970 they waged they issued a 'Declaration of a State of War' against the United States. The same year a bomb exploded inside a Greenwich Village, New York, residence prematurely, killing three members. They also staged attacks on the Capitol Building in Washington D.C after the invasion of Laos in 1971, and targeted the New York Department of Corrections building in Albany after 29 inmates died during the Attica prison riot the same year. According to The Post one of the Weathermen told Burroughs: 'We believed Third World countries would rise up and cause crises that would bring down the industrialized West, and we believed it was going to happen tomorrow, or maybe the day after tomorrow.' Former group member Howie Machtinger added: 'The myth, and this is always Bill Ayers\u2019 line, is that Weather never set out to kill people, and it\u2019s not true \u2014 we did. 'You know, policemen were fair game.' The New York Post approached Fliegelman in leafy Park Slope and asked him about his past. 'What happened 40 years ago is different from what\u2019s going on today. War was a big thing. It was on TV every night. You don\u2019t know that with the Iraqi war, the Afghanistan war. There was the draft, as well,' said Fliegelman. When it was put to the 70-year-old that he was a not a freedom fighter but a terrorist, he reportedly disagreed. 'Did you ever notice how many people were hurt by our bombs? People were not hurt by our bombs,' said Fliegelman.

Then add a zero on the end. When Chicago Fire\u2019s visit to the new home of San Jose Earthquakes ended in defeat on Sunday night, the 32-year-old confronted the reality of life in Major League Soccer. A 5,000 mile journey from California to Glasgow, lasting the best part of a day, for a midweek friendly with Northern Ireland followed by a Euro qualifier against Gibraltar. The crowds for both games will be modest. The financial rewards non-existent. Shaun Maloney made the 5,000 mile trip from Chicago to Glasgow in order to represent his country . Scotland international Maloney, pictured scoring against the Republic of Ireland, loves playing for his country . Scotland are just three points behind Group D leaders Poland in the race to qualify for Euro 2016 . Yet it only took a five-minute call to Gordon Strachan to convince him the jetlag was worth it. That the arrangement can work. \u2018We had a conversation, which was pretty brief,\u2019 said the man whose stunning goal against Ireland invigorated Scotland\u2019s latest qualifying campaign. \u2018But although it was brief, it was really important for me. \u2018I asked him if it would have any detrimental effect on my international career (moving to the States) and he said, \u201cNo\u201d. That was all I needed to know. \u2018I absolutely love playing for my country. It makes me very, very proud and it\u2019s an honour to do it and I will try my hardest to continue to make the squad no matter what league I am in.\u2019 How he might feel when the air miles mount is another matter. There were closer options. Significantly easier ways to add more caps to the display cabinet. Leaving troubled, relegation threatened Wigan in January, there was a firm offer from Leicester City. Speaking during Celtic\u2019s winter break to Gran Canaria, Ronny Deila had also expressed an interest in taking him back to Parkhead. \u2018I think the quotes by the Celtic manager were just him being very polite about me as a player,\u2019 claimed Maloney. \u2018I was a previous Celtic player. I didn\u2019t think there was too much else in it. \u2018There were options to stay in England, but I spoke to the manager and the owner in Chicago and I think my mind was pretty much made up in January. Maloney rejected interest from England and Scotland in order to seal a move to MLS outfit Chicago Fire . \u2018You have to respect any club that offers you a contract in England or Scotland. But I really wanted to try this.\u2019 He had been around the block in England and Scotland many times. Two spells at Celtic left nothing new to discover, other than a landscape with no Old Firm games. At Aston Villa and Wigan, he had also been seen the contrasts of English football, winning an FA Cup medal before flirting with a relegation battle in the Championship. A \u00a3750,000 move to Leicester was close, but fell down. Chicago\u2019s Magnificent Mile and Sears Tower were always appealing options. \u2018I have always thought about playing in this league,\u2019 he continued. \u2018I think the timing just worked. It\u2019s a completely different lifestyle, everything is new. The stadiums, the clubs I am playing against, everything. It\u2019 s all very exciting. \u2018We had a disappointing year as a club last season and the play-offs are our ambition this year. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s beyond us.\u2019 The early signs suggest otherwise. After three matches, Maloney has yet to play in a winning team and crossing the Atlantic to face Northern Ireland in a friendly is a big commitment. Without a point in the Eastern Conference, Fire host Philadelphia Union hours after Scotland\u2019s qualifier with Gibraltar on Sunday without one of their prized, high-profile designated players. Caught between a rock and a hard place, Maloney insisted: \u2018I will always make myself available for Scotland. Maloney (left, pictured with Steven Naismith) is pleased to be playing under Scotland boss Gordon Strachan . \u2018We will cross the friendlies bridge as we come to it.\u2019 His respect for the manager is a factor. Effusive in his praise of Strachan, his former Celtic manager, Maloney has new enthusiasm for international football, admitting: \u2018Look, the manager has been excellent. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t want to disrespect Craig Levein the previous manager at all. But the impact Gordon Strachan has had has been monumental. \u2018The players have bought into the system that he wants and we have some outstanding players in Steven Fletcher and Steven Naismith at Everton. \u2018I would probably put Scott Brown in that same category and then beyond that our manager is our biggest asset. We are very fortunate to have him.\u2019 Asked if this is the best Scotland team in 20 years or so he is blunt. Technically, there have been better players in dark blue. Yet Strachan\u2019s organisational skills and tactical nous are doing a decent job of covering up the cracks on the surface. \u2018Individually, we have probably had better players \u2013 or players playing at a higher level and more of them,\u2019 he said. \u2018But as a group and as a team there is a feeling about it I haven\u2019t had in quite a long time. Scotland are currently preparing for their upcoming matches against Northern Ireland and Gibraltar . \u2018We are a good side. We played very well against Ireland and were brought down to earth a little bit against England. \u2018But we have to realise what our strengths are and our weaknesses and try to get better. \u2018Germany are still favourites to qualify. Poland second and after that it\u2019s between us, Ireland and Georgia for a spot in the top two and if not third and a play-off. \u2018Scotland against Ireland in Dublin is a big, big game and the result will have big ramifications for the group \u2013 as any game does now. \u2018Ireland are strong at home and Poland were very good in Warsaw, as well. \u2018I couldn\u2019t call it, I really couldn\u2019t.\u2019 There was a brief exchange with San Jose\u2019s Glasgow-born coach Dominic Kinnear before the long journey home. Kenny Miller found the travel from Vancouver in Canada gruelling. Chicago is less northerly when it comes to flying to venues like California, yet San Jose was still a 4,000 mile round trip. \u2018You never know where and when things can change in this game,\u2019 he admitted. \u2018I\u2019ve only spent a short time in Chicago, but it\u2019s a great sporting city, it is going to be a massive lifestyle change and I am looking forward to it. \u2018I want to be part of a team which makes the city proud.

This is thought to be a pseudonym for the person or group who created it. Users choose a virtual wallet  which enables them to receive, give and trade coins from other users. The app only works with fitness trackers that monitor heart rate and have open source software, which includes the Jawbone UP3 and Mio. As the wearer exercises, the fitness tracker sends the heart rate data and length of activity to the app which then determines how much energy is being used. An algorithm then converts this energy into 'computer processing time on a Bitcoin mining rig' - or how much computer power would be needed to mine the virtual coins. A Bitcoin is a piece of data locked in an internet-based network by a complex equation computers can break. Once released it can be traded and used online and can be bought with cash. In particular, each Bitcoin is a piece of computer code that has been generated through computer processing, also known as 'mining'. During the demonstration, designer Grant Nicol wore a Mio band and ran on a treadmill for three minutes and 40 seconds. His heart rate raised to 115 beats per minute and this mined around five cents. Although this is a low amount, the technology is a concept so needs some refinement. Plus the more energy a user expends, the more money they make.

The British Cabinet believed the gesture would sway US public opinion in favour of joining the fighting in Europe, and even set a date for the handover before the deal fell through. Never-before-seen letters reveal the wartime government discussed how Americans are desperate for 'tangible evidence of their European background', meaning the gift would be of particular value. Letters written in 1941 reveal Churchill planned to gift the US a copy of the Magna Carta to persuade them to join World War Two, noting that Americans desire 'tangible evidence of their European background' The Magna Carta, which was issued by King John in 1215 establishing the rule of law and handing rights to his subjects, is also seen as a precursor to the American Constitution. In 1941, when the letters were written, a copy of the document was stranded in America following the outbreak of the war while it was on display at the New York World's Fair in 1939. The US government had already signed a deal sending vast amounts of aid money over to their struggling allies in Europe, but were still reticent about engaging in the fighting themselves. According to the letters, which go on display at the British Library from this Friday, the Americans saw the British as 'cold-blooded', 'calculating' people who failed 'to say it with flowers' The historic document (pictured), which signed over righta King John's people, is viewed as a precursor to the American constitution, and so was viewed as a generous gift . In an attempt to win them over, the British Cabinet, supported by Churchill, planned to gift them the copy of the Magna Carta, which belonged to Lincoln Cathedral. The letters, reported in The Independent, say: 'A friendly act, graciously performed, evokes a tremendous response; when an American has his emotions stirred, his generosity is unbounded. 'He will give the shirt off his back for friendship.' Officials even scheduled June 15 of that year as the day for the document to be handed over, but the deal fell through for unspecified reasons.

Exotic meats: Buffalo burger with charred tomato and basil on a seeded roll . Kangaroo meatballs served with spaghetti and tomato sauce (left) and venison sausages and mash (right) The frozen food store has launched speciality meat products which include kangaroo burgers and meatballs, wild boar sausages and burgers, ostrich fillets, buffalo burgers and crocodile burgers. Speaking about the new meat and fish ranges, Nigel Broadhurst, Joint Managing Director at Iceland, said: 'Our new meat and fish ranges are fantastic alternatives to traditional meat and fish options.' He continued: 'The speciality meats are typically lower in fat and higher in protein, while most of the fish in our new range is naturally high in protein and rich in nutrients. 'Both of the new ranges are ideal for those looking to introduce quick, versatile and tasty meals into their diet.' Surf and turf with a difference: Swordfish steak, served with vegetables (left) \u00a0and ostrich steak (right) This isn't the first time wild meats have appeared in high street stores. Last June, Tesco put free range ostrich meat on sale in 400 locations amid evidence the nation is developing a taste for exotic and unusual meat. And in December last year, Lidl was offering reindeer steaks and ostrich meat, and claimed it was unable to keep up with demand. Even  the discount chain Budgens has previously put squirrel on its shelves while Aldi offered ostrich kebabs in September 2014. Iceland is the latest high street store to offer exotic and unusual meats . The ostrich kebabs at Tesco are supplied by wholesaler DB Foods, which said a trial of Mossel Bay ostrich steaks at Britain's biggest supermarket in March 2014 had gone 'very well'. There are some ostrich farmers in the UK, however the meat being sold by Tesco comes from South Africa as the result of an exclusive deal with a farmer co-operative called Mosstrich. It is possible to buy Llama mince, imported from Chile, on Amazon plus many other exotic choices, ranging from zebra steaks and crocodile to kangaroo, camel and elk, from specialist suppliers. DB Foods is already supplying more than 2,000 High Street butchers and Whole Foods Market with the kebabs. Chief executive Ben Bayer said that ostrich was set to become increasingly visible to consumers. He said: 'It is our ambition to see ostrich become a mainstream meat. It's nutritional, has a great taste and is a healthy red meat.' Ostrich is a particularly healthy red meat, coming in at just three per cent fat, compared to around 10.5 per cent for beef, and 15.2 per cent pork.

With 55 minutes on the clock and the scoreline locked at 1-1 after Cristiano Ronaldo had cancelled out Jeremy Mathieu's opener, the Uruguayan trapped a long punt forward by Dani Alves and then arrowed the ball past Iker Casillas to restore Barca's lead at the Nou Camp. Luis Enrique's side went on to dominate the remainder of the game and won 2-1, thus building a four-point advantage at the top of the Primera Division table.

Suarez celebrates scoring the goal that sent Barcelona four points clear at the top of La Liga . The strike was Suarez's 14th in all competitions for Barcelona since he made his \u00a375million move from Liverpool last summer. And the 28-year-old had no doubt this was his most crucial goal for his new club, ranking it above the two he netted against Manchester City in the Champions League last month. 'This is the most important goal I've scored for Barca and it has an extra significance because of the rival we were playing against,' Suarez told Barcelona's official television Channel. 'I just tried to take advantage of the space between defenders and be as fast as I could so I didn't give the centre-backs any time to recover. Luckily it went in. 'The dressing room is very happy, we knew this was a really important game if we wanted to stay top of the league and increase our advantage.' Barca coach Luis Enrique sang the striker's praises after the game, calling the goal 'an action that only few players are capable of'. 'We are very happy that he is a being decisive player for us and we are very happy with his attitude and what he brings to this team,' he said. 'He brings a lot to the team he is not just a classic centre forward, he also links up with his team-mates. He's a player that marvellously compliments the squad we have, and that's why we signed him.' Jeremy Mathieu headed home the opening goal for Barcelona in the first half . Cristiano Ronaldo equalised for Real Madrid but was unable to stamp his authority on the game . Madrid now have 10 weeks to catch up with Barcelona, who have won 19 of their 21 matches in 2015. Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti lamented the fact his side failed to keep a 'cool head' after the break, following their strong performance in the opening 45 minutes. 'We were playing very well until their second goal and from then on the game was very difficult for us,' said the Italian in his post-match press conference. 'Before that we were doing well, we pressed well and were solid at the back. We lacked a cool head to turn the game around, we kept playing long balls and trying to execute difficult passages of play.' This is Ancelotti's third defeat in four league games against Barcelona and, if his side cannot bridge the four-point gap with the Catalans, he will have failed to win the Spanish league title in his first two seasons with Madrid. However, the man who delivered Los Blancos their long awaited 10th European Cup last season dismissed the suggestion his side would now focus their attention on the Champions League, with a quarter-final tie against neighbours Atletico Madrid coming up next month. He said: 'The league is not over, they have the same points advantage that we had before but anything could happen.

This time, the Ferrari driver is doing the chasing - behind the Mercedes pair of Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg. Vettel used to be the man to beat, winning the title four years in a row with Red Bull. But Mercedes ended that dominance in crushing style last year and Vettel - who seemed isolated and despondent throughout the season - made the switch to Ferrari. 'The change felt right for me and it gives me a lot of joy,' Vettel said. 'My ambition is to be right there at the top again, not only for me but also in terms of the team. In this respect, we should make a perfect fit.' Sebastian Vettel enters the new Formula One season in the unusual position of being the outsider . The Ferrari driver is doing the chasing behind the Mercedes pair of Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg . The German also gets the chance to emulate his childhood idol, seven-time champion Michael Schumacher, who won the vast majority of his titles and his 91 GPs with Ferrari. The 27-year-old Vettel, who has 39 GP wins and 45 pole positions, clearly needed to get away from Red Bull. Vettel finished a dismal fifth in the drivers' standings, with no wins and just four podium places. The gap between him and Hamilton was a mammoth 217 points. Worse still, he was usurped by his junior team-mate, Daniel Ricciardo, who finished third and won three races. The timing seemed just right for Ferrari, too, which needed a change following two seasons of tensions with Fernando Alonso. Pre-season testing has been like a fresh start. Vettel takes part in pre-season testing at Circuit de Barcelona Catalunya in his new car last month . Vettel joined Ferrari in the off-season after many successful years at Red Bull . Vettel drives behind Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg during testing in Catalonia earlier this month . 'I feel very well. The tests so far have contributed a lot to that feeling,' Vettel said. 'Of course things take time, as growing into a team that works a bit differently requires that.' The positive tone was set at the first testing session in Jerez, with Vettel and teammate Kimi Raikkonen claiming the fastest time on three of the four test days as Ferrari announced its comeback in style. Overall, a reinvigorated Vettel completed more than 600 laps over the three winter testing sessions and Ferrari showed glimpses that it can challenge Mercedes for speed. Over the 12 days of testing, Ferrari completed 1,182 laps - the fourth most mileage of any team - and the second most by power unit behind Mercedes. 'The path to the very top right now still leads via Mercedes and it is our aim not only to draw level with them but to surpass them,' Vettel said. 'That is a very ambitious goal.'

Hughes was shown a red card in Friday night\u2019s Aviva Premiership clash with Northampton for an incident which saw North suffer his third confirmed concussion in less than four months, leading to calls for him not to play again this season. An RFU disciplinary panel upheld the red card shown to Hughes by referee Craig Maxwell-Keys and banned him until April 28, meaning he will miss Sunday\u2019s European Champions Cup quarter final clash with the two-time champions. Nathan Hughes has been banned for three weeks and will miss Wasps' game against Toulon . George North was out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens after scoring a try . Sir James Dingemans, chair of a three-man panel with Aidan O\u2019Brien and Martyn Wood, said: \u2018This was a three week ban on the basis that no intention was found. However, there was recklessness meaning that, notwithstanding the harm, it was a low entry point of four weeks with mitigation of one week to reflect his previous clean playing record.' Speaking before the hearing Wasps director of rugby Dai Young made it clear he did not believe his star forward should be punished further and indicated he would appeal any ban. \u2018I don\u2019t think it was a red card,\u2019 said Young. \u2018The sending off certainly penalised us enough on the night. If there is a ban we can appeal it. If there\u2019s a ban we\u2019ll have to sit down and decide what to do with Nathan because he needs to be part of the process.\u2019 It is understood any appeal would be heard before Sunday\u2019s clash, meaning Hughes could yet feature. The incident left North concussed in the act of scoring his second try of the match and has led to calls for the Wales and Northampton winger to be rested for the rest of the season over fears for his long-term welfare. North was knocked out again and was forced off after a clash with Hughes during Saints' win over \u00a0Wasps . North was unable to continue and has been advised not to play again until the World Cup in September . Hughes was understood to be distraught after the game and sought North out to apologise. \u2018I know Nathan,\u2019 said Wasps club captain James Haskell. \u2018I don\u2019t think he meant to do it. I think anyone knows he didn\u2019t mean to do it. I don\u2019t think it should have been a red card at all. I think he tried to slow down, he catches George but it is a contact sport. \u2018That is what happens. I think they have changed the wording now to say something about being reckless but rugby is reckless. The whole game is reckless. If you are worried about that, I don\u2019t really know what we should be doing. \u2018Maybe we should all just wear foam suits and just play touch.\u2019 Young said after the game that he believed the repeated replays on the big screen at Franklin\u2019s Gardens, allied to a partisan home ground, had pressurised the match officials into sending Hughes off. Haskell also has recent experience of the impact of replays following the second-half yellow card he was shown for a trip in England\u2019s Six Nations clash with France by referee Nigel Owens after he viewed footage on the big screen. \u2018I don\u2019t think it helps with the crowd getting on top of referees,\u2019 he said. \u2018With Nigel Owens, we (England) had set for a scrum. It was a yellow card, there is no arguing that, but the fact they replayed it seven times and the same with Nathan, replaying it, I don\u2019t think it helps. If you slow anything down it will look worse than it is. \u2018I just think that those TMOs are there, they have all the angles to see it. It is down to their job, I don\u2019t know why you have to share. Replays are good but any contentious stuff, why would you let emotion (come into it) because we are all fallible. The fact I made a mistake shows I am fallible.

It appears that some fungi emit light to attract insects at night, which then spread their fungal spores around. And interestingly, the mushrooms are also able to sync up their ability with the circadian clock, so they only become bioluminescent when it is dark. Scientists in Brazil studied why certain species of mushroom glow. They found the ability helps them attract insects at night. These creatures will then move their fungal spores elsewhere. But the mushrooms are able to turn off the ability during the day. Pictured is\u00a0Neonothopanus gardneri . The research, published in the journal Current Biology, was led by the University of Sao Paulo. Among bioluminescent organisms, fungi are the most rare and least understood. Of more than 100,000 species of fungi, only 71 are known to produce green light, a process that uses oxygen and energy. Scientists had thought they produce light around the clock as byproduct of their metabolism, but based on new evidence it seems that isn't so. The effect is triggered by a chemical reaction between luciferin, a light-emitting pigment, and the enzyme luciferase. It can occur in fungi as well as in a range of animals including jellyfish, squid, scorpions and other insects. In fact, the mushrooms' glow appears to be under the control of a temperature-compensated circadian clock. This level of control helps them 'save energy' during hours of daylight when they do not need to grow. At night, the green glow attracts insects including beetles, flies, wasps and ants. 'It appears that fungi make light so they are noticed by insects who can help the fungus colonize new habitats,' said Dr Cassius Stevani of Brazil's Instituto de Qu\u00edmica-Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo. The circadian control of bioluminescence makes the process more efficient. 'Regulation implies an adaptive function for bioluminescence,' added Dr Jay Dunlap of Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine. Here the species Neonothopanus gardneri is seen during the day, when its bioluminescent ability 'turns off' in order to conserve energy.\u00a0Scientists had thought they produce light around the clock as byproduct of their metabolism, but based on this new evidence it seems that isn't so . To make the findings, the researchers made sticky, fake mushrooms out of acrylic resin and lit them from inside with green LED lights (shown).\u00a0When those pretend fungi were placed in the forest , the ones that were lit led many more insects to get stuck than did comparably sticky dark mushrooms . The research focused on Neonothopanus gardneri, one of the biggest and brightest of bioluminescent mushrooms. N. gardneri is also called 'flor de coco,' meaning coconut flower, by locals in Brazil, where the mushroom can be found attached to leaves at the base of young palm trees in coconut forests. Other fungi have other methods to disperse their spores like the Common Stinkhorn (shown), which releases a foul smell to get flies to attract flies . To make the findings, the researchers made sticky, fake mushrooms out of acrylic resin and lit them from inside with green LED lights. When those pretend fungi were placed in the forest where the real bioluminescent mushrooms are found, the ones that were lit led many more insects to get stuck than did comparably sticky dark mushrooms. The team are now hoping to identify the genes responsible for the mushrooms' bioluminescence, and aims to explore their interaction with the circadian clock that controls them. They are also using infrared cameras to watch the interaction between N. gardneri mushrooms and arthropods, especially larger ones, more closely. And the findings could also reveal how mushrooms are dispersed by insects, which is important because N. gardneri plays a key role in forest ecosystems. 'Without them, cellulose would be stuck in its form, which would impact the whole carbon cycle on Earth,' said Dr  Stevani. 'I dare to say that life on Earth depends on organisms like these.' Some fungi in the group known as basidiomycetes, including two bioluminescent mushrooms, are also parasites of coffee and pine trees. As a result, Stevani says, 'it is very important to know how basidiomycetes grow and consequently how they spread their spores.'", "reference": "Scientists in Brazil studied why certain species of mushroom glow .\nThey found the ability helps them attract insects at night .\nThese creatures will then move their fungal spores elsewhere .\nBut the mushrooms are able to turn off the ability during the day .\n'I dare to say that life on Earth depends on organisms like these,' said one of the researchers, Dr Stevani ."}, "225": {"id": "7639e8c22f4ed29800bf27565e508c8e00f541e5", "article": "Within hours of a white officer shooting an unarmed black man, the police chief of Wisconsin's capital city was praying with the man's grandmother, hoping to strike a conciliatory tone and avoid the riots that last year rocked Ferguson, Missouri. Chief Mike Koval said he knows Madison is being watched across the nation since 19-year-old Tony Robinson's death on Friday evening, and he has gone out of his way to avoid what he once called Ferguson's 'missteps.' 'Folks are angry, resentful, mistrustful, disappointed, shocked, chagrined. I get that,' Koval said Saturday. 'People need to tell me squarely how upset they are with the Madison Police Department.' Scroll down for video . Chief Mike Koval said he knows Madison is being watched across the nation since 19-year-old Tony Robinson's death on Friday evening, and he has gone out of his way to avoid what he once called Ferguson's 'missteps' The contrasts with Ferguson are many. While Ferguson police initially gave little information about the shooting of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old, unarmed black man, Koval rushed to the home of Robinson's mother. She didn't want to meet with him, he said, but he talked and prayed with Robinson's grandmother in the driveway for 45 minutes. It took a week for Ferguson to release the name of the officer who shot Brown. Koval announced the name of the officer involved in Madison, Matt Kenny, the day after the shooting. He volunteered to reporters that the officer had been in a previous fatal shooting in 2007, and that he had been cleared of wrongdoing. On the day that Ferguson police named the officer who shot Brown, they also released video showing what they said was Brown robbing a store. Tony Robinson, an unarmed black 19-year-old, was fatally shot Friday, by Matt Kenny, a white police officer, the Madison police chief said Saturday . When Koval was asked about Robinson's past criminal record Saturday, he declined to comment, saying it would be inappropriate to do so a day after the man died. 'We have a police chief who genuinely feels for a family's loss. It should be abundantly clear to anyone following this incident that Madison, Wisconsin, is not Ferguson, Missouri,' said Jim Palmer, executive director of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association, the state's largest police union. But the chief's measured approach hasn't impressed some demonstrators. Koval angered some of them earlier this year with a blog post demanding they stop blaming police for their problems. 'There are no apologies that can repair the loss or deal with the loss of (Robinson),' said Brandi Grayson, an organizer with Young, Gifted and Black, a Madison group that has demonstrated against what it says is mistreatment of blacks by the justice system. 'This was bound to happen. There's nothing the chief can say short of changing the system.' People gather outside the house where Tony Robinson was shot during a rally on Saturday to protest his death . Robinson died on Friday night after Kenny shot him in an apartment during a confrontation. Kenny had responded to a call of a man jumping in and out of traffic. Kenny forced his way into the apartment after hearing what Koval described as a 'disturbance.' The state Justice Department's Division of Criminal Investigation has taken over the investigation under a new state law passed last year that requires an outside agency to lead probes of officer-involved shootings. DOJ spokeswoman Anne Schwartz declined to comment on Sunday. The shooting comes against a backdrop of multiple instances of white police officers killing unarmed black men around the country over the last year. The highest-profile incident was the death of Brown in Ferguson last August. Days of violence ensued, marked by looting, fires, police firing tear gas into a crowd and officers pointing weapons at demonstrators. Another round of riots broke out in November after a grand jury chose not to indict the officer who shot Brown, Darren Wilson. While Robinson's mom didn't want to meet with him, Madison Police Chief Mike Koval talked and prayed with the dead man's grandmother for 45 minutes . Relatives and friends of Tony Robinson exit a gathering of church representatives, community leaders and residents at Fountain of Life Covenant Church, Saturday, in Madison, Wis. Last week the U.S. Justice Department declined to charge Wilson with civil rights violations but issued a scathing report accusing the Ferguson police department of racism and using policing to fund the city's budget. Koval, who is white, took over as Madison's chief in April, replacing retiring black Chief Noble Wray. In September he told the Wisconsin State Journal he believed his department could deal with a racially charged shooting better than Ferguson, saying his agency is more diverse and more invested in the community than Ferguson's 'rent-a-cops.' 'I see in Ferguson a series of missteps and miscues where they're always reacting and, in fact, over-reacting to every set of facts that is thrown in their midst, frankly,' Koval said in the interview. Two months ago, Koval wrote a blog post criticizing Young, Black and Gifted for blaming his officers for 'everything from male pattern baldness to global warming.' The entry came in response to the group staging protests over officer-involved deaths during rush-hour traffic, demanding jail officials release 350 black inmates and imploring police to stay out of black neighborhoods. Koval tried to be diplomatic when asked about the post on Saturday, saying he and the group have agreed to disagree on policing black neighborhoods. Grayson said Koval has had plenty of time to prepare for a racially charged shooting after watching what unfolded in Ferguson. 'He had a perfect response \u2014 perfect for white people,' she said.

Attorney A.M. 'Marty' Stroud III, from Shreveport, Louisiana, admitted that he was to blame for putting father-of-four Glenn Ford behind bars in 1984 for the fatal shooting of a jeweler. 'In 1984, I was 33 years old,' he wrote in a letter to The Shreveport Times. 'I was arrogant, judgmental, narcissistic and very full of myself. I was not as interested in justice as I was in winning.' Ford, now 65, was released from the prison in Angola in March 2014 but last month, he learned he has stage four lung cancer and just four to eight months left to live. Scroll down for video . Apologies: Attorney A.M. 'Marty' Stroud III, pictured, has written a lengthy letter apologizing to an innocent man he sent to death row as he slammed the state for refusing to pay the man compensation . Earlier this month, the state argued that Ford is not entitled to receive compensation for his time behind bars because\u00a0he is unable to prove he is 'factually innocent'. In his letter, Stroud, 63, slammed the decision. 'Glenn Ford should be completely compensated to every extent possible because of the flaws of a system that effectively destroyed his life,' Stroud said. 'The audacity of the state's effort to deny Mr. Ford any compensation for the horrors he suffered in the name of Louisiana justice is appalling.' Ford was accused of shooting Isadore Rozeman, a Shreveport jeweler and watchmaker for whom Mr Ford had done occasional yard work, in 1983 and was convicted the following year. He was sent to prison, where he lived with little light or heat, while Stroud, who had been with the Caddo District Attorney's office for two years, went out to celebrate by having drinks with his team. 'That's sick,' he said in his letter. 'I had been entrusted with the duty to seek the death of a fellow human being, a very solemn task that certainly did not warrant any \"celebration\".' From behind bars, Ford continued to protest his innocence. Glenn Ford, now 65, was convicted of an 1983 murder but was released a year ago after evidence showed he was not at the scene. He has since been diagnosed with cancer and has four to eight months to live . Then in 2013, State District Judge Ramona Emanuel voided the conviction and sentence based on the new information that corroborated his claim he was not present or involved in Rozeman's death. 'My fault was that I was too passive,' Stroud said in his letter. 'Had I been more inquisitive, perhaps the evidence would have come to light years ago... Wrongly accused: Ford, a father-of-four (pictured in a booking photo), was sent to death row in 1984 . 'I did not hide evidence, I simply did not seriously consider that sufficient information may have been out there that could have led to a different conclusion. And that omission is on me.' Stroud said he still does not know the extent of the new information that led to Ford's release. But he added that the odds were stacked against Ford, whose attorneys were inexperienced in criminal law. He also faced an all-white jury. In light of the new evidence, Stroud said he realized how wrong he had been. 'I speak only for me and no one else,' he said. 'I apologize to Glenn Ford for all the misery I have caused him and his family. I apologize to the family of Mr. Rozeman for giving them the false hope of some closure.' In a separate interview with The Shreveport Times, Stroud again called for Ford to be compensated and for the 'barbaric' death penalty to be abolished. Ford walked free from Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola on March 11, 2014, wearing a jean jacket, sweater and beanie hat and carrying all of his worldly possessions in two tiny boxes. As he walked out of the prison gates, he said he was sad he had not been around to raise his now-adult sons, but added: 'It feels good; my mind is going in all kind of directions. It feels good.' Freed: Ford is pictured in March 2014 as he was freed from the state prison following 30 years behind bars. He was given just $20 but was taken in by a non-profit group who found a free place for him to stay . Prison officials gave the then-64-year-old a debit card worth just $20. That, along with the money that he had in his bank account, left Mr Ford with a paltry $20.04 to his name. His lawyers set up an Amazon wishlist for strangers to donate funds and items - from furniture to clothing - so Ford could start to re-build his life. With the help of a non-profit group, Resurrection After Exoneration, he had a place to live free of charge and has since moved to his own apartment. He relies on Social Security disability and food stamps, and has also visited California to see his four sons. He has also filed separate federal lawsuits claiming he was wrongfully imprisoned and was denied medical care following his cancer diagnosis. He names numerous prison guards and prison doctors for ignoring his condition and says his poor living conditions, including contact with sewage and asbestos, contributed to his illness. After he left prison, he learned he had Stage 3 lung cancer, which has now progressed to Stage 4. Making the days count: Ford, pictured last month, relies on Social Security disability and food stamps. He is suing the state for denying him medical care for his lung cancer, which is now terminal . 'I'm trying to make every day count,' he told The Shreveport Times from his home in New Orleans after learning he had just months to live. He said if he does get awarded any money, he plans to leave it to his grandchildren. He said he has between 17 and 21 - but could not be sure how many. Of his situation, he said: 'I don't have no anger. I have anger that I have cancer. I have resentment Angola allowed this to happen. I guess everything is for a reason. I really don't know.' Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections spokeswoman Pam Laborde told The Times-Picayune that she could not comment due to pending litigation and privacy issues. No one has been charged with Rozeman's death. Three men had also initially been arrested in the crime but were ultimately released because of insufficient evidence.

A source told The Times that the extremist hid in a lorry, which crossed the Channel on a ferry to France and that he was then able to travel across Europe unchecked until he reached Turkey. They added that he passed through the Turkish border with ease and then continued his journey to Syria to join up with ISIS in early 2013. Emwazi has been on the radar of MI5 since May 2009, when it is thought he tried to reach Somalia to join Islamist terror group al-Shabaab.

The next day \u2013 to Emwazi\u2019s fury, given he claimed to have a job and bride-to-be in Kuwait \u2013 he was prevented from flying. A possible attempt to leave London for Saudi Arabia in 2012 was also blocked. But after managing to leave Britain for Syria, he has gained global notoriety as the masked killer of Western hostages including British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines in ISIS beheading videos which have shocked the world. Emwazi was born in Kuwait to a stateless family of Iraqi origin. His parents moved to Britain in 1993 after their hopes of obtaining Kuwaiti citizenship were quashed. Meanwhile, Emwazi's father, Jasem Emwazi, has said he is not sure that his son is masked ISIS butcher Jihadi John, according to his lawyer. The 51-year-old feels there is 'no proof' that the black-clad knife-wielding man featured in chilling hostage execution videos is his eldest child, it was reported today. His Kuwaiti lawyer, Salem Al-Hashah, told Kuwait's respected Al-Qabas newspaper: 'He is not sure that he [Jihadi John] is his son. 'There is no proof that the man shown in the videos and photographs is his son, as the media has reported in the last few days.' He added: 'There is no evidence that Mohammed is the man in the videos because his face was covered.' Jasem Emwazi, the father of Mohammed Emwazi, who has said that he is not sure that his son is the masked ISIS butcher Jihadi John . The lawyer's comments appear to contradict earlier remarks made by Mr Emwazi, who is said to have told a colleague that his son is 'a dog, an animal, a terrorist' and called for him to be killed. Mr Emwazi, who moved to the UK from his native Kuwait in 1994 and holds a British passport, was seen in public for the first time today since he was questioned by Kuwaiti police at the weekend about his son's activities. Mr Al-Hashah said the father is not responsible for what his son has done and that there is nothing to prove his father agreed with his son, or helped him in any way. The lawyer added: 'Jasem Emwazi is under stress. Many people are calling him names. He can't leave his home and can't walk outside. He is scared of people because everyone believes all the rumours that have been written about him.' The Daily Mail revealed yesterday that housing and state benefits for Emwazi's family since they came to the UK from Kuwait 20 years ago has cost taxpayers \u00a3400,000. After his father returned to Kuwait, other members of his family in Britain have been moved out of their homes for their own protection and are being guarded at a cost of \u00a35,000 a day.", "reference": "ISIS executioner Jihadi John unmasked as Mohammed Emwazi last week .\nIt is claimed he escaped Britain by hiding in the back of a freight lorry .\nThe lorry then boarded a ferry and crossed the Channel into France .\nHe travelled across Europe unchecked before crossing into Turkey .\nEmwazi then continued his journey to Syria so he could join up with ISIS .\nHome Office now facing questions after Emwazi was on an MI5 watchlist ."}, "233": {"id": "d97ce64396788709a0f2612a767ef2329d449544", "article": "Harry Kane may have taken the impact debut to another level with his goal after 79 seconds but he was not the first new cap to make a quick impression in England colours this season.

For a time it was hard to know if his premature end would be via red card or substitution.

Delph left his mark on the Swiss in more ways than one, adding much-needed bite to Roy Hodgson\u2019s midfield . Delph \u00a0cleaned up his disciplinary record to help international career after collecting 20 yellows in two years . The Aston Villa midfielder soon settled, however, and it turned out to be neither. He produced a terrific display in Basle and won his fourth cap against Lithuania on Friday. He has also cleaned up his disciplinary record to help his international career and, after collecting 20 in two years, has just one yellow and one red in 26 appearances this season for club and country. \u2018You\u2019ve got to be more careful,\u2019 said Delph. \u2018I like to tackle and I\u2019ve managed to curb it this season. I got the yellow against Switzerland and then the red against Sunderland but other than that I\u2019ve been pretty clean. I\u2019m usually on about nine or 10 bookings at this stage! \u2018It\u2019s hard to lunge into tackles in international football. If you lunge in on a top-class international footballer they just skip round you or you bring them down. I tried to set a target. I\u2019ve been able to do that so I\u2019m quite proud.\u2019 Harry Kane made a big impact on debut twith his goal after just 79 seconds seconds at Wembley Stadium . Both Kane and Delph shone for England as Roy Hodgson's side swept Lithuania aside at Wembley .

I tried to impose myself early on and mistimed it. After that it was just about trying to stay on my feet, trying to get through the game, trying to perform well, with good energy, keep the ball moving and I managed to do that.\u2019 Dennis Wise can testify to this fondness for physical combat having been cut down by a teenage Delph during one of the regular games between the Leeds staff and youth team. Wise, manager at Elland Road at the time, liked his style and picked him for the first team before he was 18. Lithuania's Tomas Mikuckis tracks Aston Villa and England midfielder Delph during the game at Wembley . \u2018Those games did get quite tasty,\u2019 said Delph. \u2018I did tackle him and he tackled me back. They tended to get quite heated. He gave me my debut. I\u2019m so grateful to Dennis. And Gus Poyet, his assistant. Gus could kick a few people as well.\u2019 This breakthrough rewarded years of commitment from Delph and his mother Donna, who would hop on various buses and trains together to get to academy training sessions. \u2018It\u2019s funny to look back on this little kid jumping off the bus to training,\u2019 he said. \u2018At one point, it would take three buses and one train. But it\u2019s worked out well. I\u2019ve always been pushed hard to succeed. To get those buses, it was nothing.\u2019 As soon as he was able, he bought his mother a house. \u2018She\u2019s my hero,\u2019 said Delph. \u2018We didn\u2019t have a car, so she took me on the bus or on the train and she believed in me. She was just a great Mum and a great role model.\u2019 Delph speaks to the media at an England press conference ahead of the midweek clash with Italy . Determination is a recurring theme for Delph, who swapped hometown Bradford for Leeds at the age of 11 and then joined Villa for \u00a36million in 2009, only to be hit by serious knee injuries. \u2018I ruptured my anterior cruciate ligament, had bad medial ligament damage and tore my lateral meniscus and (knee surgeon) Andy Williams managed to save that,\u2019 said Delph. \u2018I got back quite quickly and then broke down four times. I did my medial again on the other knee and then the knees were done and it was my ankles; the left ankle, the right ankle a few times. It was a rollercoaster ride. It made me stronger. It made me realise how much it takes to play at a high level and physically be strong. I worked really hard in the gym. Aston Villa midfielder Delph has a pop at goal during England's clash with Lithuania at Wembley Stadium . \u2018I was confident of coming out the other end but there were always questions.

He missed two months with a shoulder injury soon after breaking into Hodgson\u2019s team but bounced back again, signing a new deal which ties him to Villa Park until 2019.

A high-ranking officer in the Royal Navy 'deceitfully' forged the signature of a Lieutenant Commander who accused him of harassment and bullying to 'protect himself from future complaints', a court martial heard today. Captain Edwin Tritschler, 48, of Yeovilton in Somerset, is accused of forging the signature of Lieutenant Commander Christopher Bovill on documents to bring an end to the 'never-ending' list of complaints against him. He is accused of using a scanner and a computer to help forge Lt Cdr Bovill's signature on three separate documents. The court heard the forged documents were created by Tritschler to show the complaint department that he had given clear management advice to his junior. They also heard the pair had a 'difficult' relationship while they were both working on-board HMS Illustrious in July 2007, when it was based in New York. Captain Tritschler thought Lt Cdr Bovill's performance was 'substandard' while on board the Invincible-class aircraft carrier, Portsmouth Military Court Centre in Hampshire heard. Meanwhile, Lt Cdr Bovill believed Captain Tritschler to be 'abrupt', 'blunt' and accused him of being a 'bully'. Their feud resulted in Lt Cdr Bovill - who left his Major rank in the Army in 2006 to transfer to the Navy - pursuing the complaint service in the Royal Navy. Lt Cdr Bovill joined the Navy as senior air engineering officer and was working under Captain Tritschler, who was then a Commander. Captain Tritschler denies three counts of forgery. David Richards, prosecuting, said: 'The accused, Captain Tritschler, is a man of previous impeccable character. 'In 2007 and 2008 he was the head of air engineering on HMS Illustrious. In July 2007 the complainant, Lieutenant Commander Bovill, was transferred to HMS Illustrious, which was the first ship he had served on. 'It was clear the two men had a very difficult relationship. 'Captain Tritschler thought Bovill's performance was substandard. Bovill found Tritschler to be officious, abrupt and bullying. 'The disagreement between the two men resulted in Lt Cdr Bovill pursuing the complaint service. The pair had a 'difficult' relationship while they were working on HMS Illustrious (pictured) in 2007 . 'In February 2008 Lt Cdr Bovill submitted a complaint and a decision was reached but Lt Cdr Bovill was not happy and asked for it to be taken to the next level.' The court then heard Captain Tritschler allegedly forged Lt Cdr Bovill's signature on three separate documents. Mr Richards added: 'What the documents appear to show is regular manager advice from Captain Tritschler to Bovill and the documents bear signatures of both men. 'However, the signatures of Bovill were not put there by Bovill. Rather they are copied and forged, possibly using a scanner. 'There is no dispute that these signatures are forged. The dispute is whether Captain Tritschler is responsible for them. 'The prosecution's case is that Captain Tritschler only ever had the documents and the idea that someone else infiltrated them is fanciful. 'It was deliberate and deceitful and was quite out of character for a man who has the rank Captain Tritschler does. The court heard how when Bovill joined the navy he 'struggled' to cope and noticed Captain Tritschler had an 'abrupt management style'. Mr Richards said: 'Lt Cdr Bovill made mistakes, however he felt these were dealt with in an unacceptable way by his superior, the accused, who he accused of humiliating and undermining him.' 'On February 21, 2008, Lt Cdr Bovill submitted his first complaint of bullying (regarding Tritschler's behaviour).' When he realised the signatures on the documents were forged, Lt Cdr Bovill reported it and Captain Tritschler was subsequently interviewed. In interview, Cpt Tritschler denied forging the signatures and said he remembered Lt Cdr Bovill signing them in his presence. Mr Richards said: 'He insisted the documents were signed in front of him. 'The prosecution's case is that it was Captain Tritschler who generated these false documents in an attempt to bring an end what seemed like a never-ending complaint process.' Lt Cdr Bovill today told the board: 'Our relationship significantly deteriorated. I know that I made mistakes in how I went about my professional business. 'But I wanted to submit a complaint about the behaviour I was receiving. I thought he had a very abrupt and blunt manner with me.'

The FBI says the 'Veloz Crew' - headed by Danny Veloz, who is known as 'The Maestro' - went to elaborate lengths to kidnap a man they believed to be a major dealer of homemade Percocet pills, which deliver a heroin-like high. The plot was one of many underground kidnappings that police say targeted dealers in order to obtain large ransoms of cash or drugs, believing that going after criminals reduced the risk of involving authorities.

'Kidnap bag': The gang would pose as police, or use skeleton masks to disguise themselves, before swiping their targets off the street, sometimes in broad daylight . The tracking device would call Veloz's cellphone once the target's car started moving. On July 12, 2012, they were ready to pounce. The gang had a kidnap bag full of police shirts, skeleton masks and guns. According to The Herald, Jose Guzman, Henry Maldonado, Thomas Wallace, Luis Reynoso, and Gadiel Romero all suited up and got into \u00a0a white Toyota minivan. Veloz, the leader, was on the phone to Guzman from another location. As the victim pulled into his driveway about 7 p.m., the abductors pulled in behind and came out with guns. Both the target and the man he was with were abducted. The target was hit in the head with a handgun, causing 'blood to spray throughout the van,' according to an affidavit. The two were taken to Maldonado\u2019s apartment in Manchester, N.H., where the crew demanded payment. The target victim refused to cooperate, and was beaten and burned with a hot iron, the affidavit said. He suffered several burn injuries.

Jewels worth at least \u00a37million were stolen by armed robbers who struck yesterday at a toll booth on the route linking Paris to the South of France. The daring raid took place just after midnight as the security trucks approached the toll at Avallon in Burgundy, 125 miles south-east of Paris on the A6. Burnt-out vehicles are seen after a group of battle-hardened armed thieves attacked two heavily guarded vans carrying jewels . Authorities are combing the Yonne region in Burgundy southeast of Paris and surrounding areas for the attackers (file picture) The robbery took place on the A6 highway connecting Paris and Lyon . The A6 is a major route connecting the north and south of the country . As they slowed for the barrier, four cars forced them to a halt and up to 15 robbers appeared wearing balaclavas and brandishing automatic weapons. They used gas sprays to knock out the two armed guards in each lorry. The guards were pulled from their cabs and dumped by the toll booth. Yesterday's raid bore all the hallmarks of having been carried out by the Pink Panthers, a gang responsible for audacious heists across Europe and beyond over the past two decades. They always wear balaclavas or face masks and use Kalashnikovs and high-powered stolen cars to carry out their spectacular crimes. The Pink Panthers are said to speak several languages and travel on genuine passports issued to other people, but with the photos changed. Many are former soldiers from Eastern Europe. France is their favoured operating ground but they have carried out more than 100 heists across the globe, netting \u00a3300million. Cities where they have struck include London, Dubai, Geneva, Monte Carlo and Tokyo. In 2008 a court in Chambery, south-eastern France, found three Serb members of the Pink Panthers guilty of carrying out robberies in Biarritz, Cannes, Courchevel and Saint-Tropez. No shots were fired and the robbers drove off in the security trucks, which belonged to a Paris company and were full of jewels and other valuables. Other gang members escaped in the cars. Prosecutors said much of the raid would have been caught on CCTV. The trucks were found burned out \u2013 and empty \u2013 four hours later, 20 miles north in a wood in the village of Quenne, just off the A6 near Auxerre. A mechanical digger was discovered with its arm inside one truck, suggesting that the safes on board were transferred to the get-away cars. There were reports that the cars were spotted speeding towards Paris. Police helicopters and other units were scrambled to hunt the gang but by dawn there was no sign. The security guards are being held for questioning. The A6, known as the \u2018Motorway of the Sun\u2019 is hugely popular with holidaymakers, and is used by hundreds of thousands of British drivers every year. The methods used in the robbery immediately led to speculation that the Pink Panthers \u2013 a notorious gang of criminals from Eastern Europe \u2013 had struck again. The gang earned their name in 1993 after stealing a \u00a3500,000 diamond from a jewellers in Mayfair, London, and hiding it in a jar of face cream \u2013 a tactic copied from the 1963 film The Pink Panther, starring Peter Sellers as the bungling Inspector Clouseau. The film\u2019s title refers to the name of the missing diamond, although a cartoon pink panther appears in the opening and closing credits.

Spend-thrift baseball executive Billy Beane -- made famous by Brad Pitt's Oscar-nominated portrayal in \"Moneyball\" -- is taking up a position with Dutch club AZ Alkmaar. \"I'm truly excited for the opportunity to be part of AZ Alkmaar in an advisory role,\" Beane told the AZ website. \"Despite being a great football club with a storied history, they face many of the challenges we have with the Oakland A's. My love for football and AZ's vision of the future of the club made this an attractive pursuit.\" The idea behind \"Moneyball\" is to obtain maximum value for each player bought or sold. Beane has had a longstanding fascination with European football, citing Arsenal's Arsene Wenger as a manager he admires for his blend of performance on the pitch and financial prudence. The American has said in the past that it was his dream to be an executive at a football club once his baseball career ended.  It turns out he didn't have to wait that long. \"I think it's interesting and exciting for him personally,\" said Chris Anderson, co-founder of the sports analytics consultancy Anderson Sally. \"He's been a football fan for many, many years and is very well informed about the sport and industry. This is not as much a stretch as one might imagine; he actually knows football.\" Beane will retain his general manager duties with the Oakland A's, a team that remains competitive despite sporting one of the lowest payrolls in Major League Baseball (MLB). The A's have qualified for MLB's playoffs each of the past three seasons, only to be knocked out before the World Series every time. Critics of baseball's sabermetrics system -- using data to analyze the sport as exposed in Michael Lewis' \"Moneyball\" book which inspired the film -- are quick to point out that Beane has never won a title with the A's. In Holland, Beane won't need to start from scratch, as AZ currently sits comfortably in fourth place in the Dutch Eredivisie. AZ's director of football Earnie Stewart is a known \"Moneyball\" fan himself, having organized a screening for his fellow AZ execs shortly after joining the club. The former U.S. midfielder, who scored against Colombia in the 1994 World Cup, is half-Dutch and hopes the collaboration with Beane can give the club an extra edge. \"We've had a lot of contact with Billy In the last few months\", Stewart told the club's website. \"His knowledge and ideas are impressive. Also Billy's soccer network is excellent. We have already noticed that Billy thinks two steps ahead in the area of innovation. That's what really connects with the ambitions of AZ.\" Like the A's, AZ have managed to compete with the big boys of the Dutch league -- chiefly PSV and Ajax -- on a limited budget, winning the domestic league twice -- most recently in 2009 -- while finishing in the top five in three of the past five seasons. Beane's philosophy is shaped by getting maximum bang for your buck in the transfer market. \"There is a misconception that you never pay much for anybody, but that is not true at all,\" Beane told the Telegraph in 2011. \"You want to make sure you are getting more value than you are paying. That may come in the form of a very expensive player, it may come in the form of a very young player, but it's not about being cheap or not spending money.\" But it's questionable whether \"Moneyball\" principles can be applied to football, a sport where -- unlike in U.S. sports leagues -- players are rarely traded for one another. Instead, athletes are sold for prices determined by a marketplace, untethered by salary caps. However, Anderson argues Beane could be about to exploit a gap in the market. \"I would say unequivocally that markets for players are much more inefficient in soccer than in baseball,\" said Anderson, who also wrote \"The Numbers Game: Everything You Know About Football Is Wrong.\" \"The combination of a global market plus inefficiency means that is a huge opportunity in soccer that there isn't in the same way in baseball.\" Either way, Beane is likely to relish the challenge of imparting his knowledge to the boardrooms of European football, perhaps even as a pre-cursor to a full time job in the sport. \"I think he certainly would be open to the possibility of taking on a role,\" said Anderson, adding that Beane could be using the advisory position to dip his toe into the shark-infested waters of football player transfers. \"In football we're still in a pre-'Moneyball' era,\" added Anderson. \"So the baseball equivalent of the mid-1990s. is the football equivalent of 2015.\"", "reference": "Baseball's Billy Beane to join top-tier Dutch club as executive .\nSmaller clubs seeking advantage over big -pending giants ."}, "243": {"id": "b0a044ba82b73d01d80dfbfa38048c0a5f749989", "article": "Barbara Bush, having changed her mind about her son's candidacy for president, now says that Jeb is Republicans' 'best chance of taking back the White House in 2016.'

Listen, what do you mean, \"too many Bushes'?... I changed my mind!\" Jeb had been talking about the number of family members who work with the charity when his mother interrupted him. 'My mother not long ago said, \"There have been enough Bushes.\" And it got me thinking, if we've had enough Bushes in one forum, do we have too many Bushes in the family literacy forum today?' he said, according to CNN. That's when his mother stepped in to say that her feelings had shifted. 'Hey, Mom,' he said back to her. 'Can I get that in writing?' 'I said our problems are so big that it doesn't matter what your last name is in America, if America needs you for as long as you can help. And yes, you can get it in writing and in public,' she told him. Jeb, who is known to be close with his mother, replied, 'I love you. You\u2019re the greatest mother in the world.' A former Florida governor who has been talked about as a candidate for president for nearly as long as his brother George W. has been out office, is nearly all in to the 2016 race, with the exception of an official announcement.

Boo-Boo and Hee-Hee were in fact fictional beings of Mr Miliband's creation and they lived on a place called Faraway Planet. 'Nobody visits them because they are far away,' explained Mr Miliband with a logic so faultless you could almost call it Marxist. He and his wide-eyed sons were walking down a London street, accompanied by no one \u2013 except, that is, an ITV film crew. Presenter Ben Shephard was holding Daniel's hand. Can anyone remind me of Mr Miliband's position about Press intrusion into private lives? Any idea that it was normal for Mr Miliband to take the little ones to school was soon dashed. He admitted it was 'a rare treat' for him. Oh, so you mean he only did it to give us a false impression that he is a new man?

It is certainly true to say David has moved on from it. He moved to New York! 'He's got his own thing that he's doing,' said Ed. 'He wants to focus on that.' Got that, David? If all this was toe-curling, wait till you hear what Shepard asked next. He mentioned Mr Miliband's lovely wife Justine, noted how busy their lives were, and asked our would-be prime minister: 'How do you keep the romance going?' Strewth. How much detail were we after here? Even Mr Miliband looked a bit staggered at this descent into bedroom territory. Pinkening, he said 'that's a good question'. He added that 'there's nothing more we like than a night in, just spending some time together'. Enough, enough! The interview was the last in ITV's breakfast TV one-to-ones with the party leaders.

The lawsuit names as defendants a classmate who gave Stiner the caffeine powder; Amazon, which shipped it to the woman last March; and six Arizona-based companies that the father's attorney said packaged and sold the pharmaceutical-grade powder under the name Hard Rhino. The lawyer, Brian Balser, said Friday that the Arizona companies appear to be related. An Amazon.com Inc. spokesman declined to comment on the lawsuit.

Balser said that after the death of a college student in Georgia in June and a consumer warning from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Hard Rhino stopped selling caffeine powder on Amazon. Balser said, however, that he ordered powdered caffeine from another company off the Internet two weeks ago. 'It's still out there,' he said. The lawsuit focuses on the Hard Rhino package label. Popular: Logan Stiner was just days away from graduating from high school when he overdosed on caffeine . The lawsuit says the package informed users that a cup of coffee contains about 1/32nd of a teaspoon of caffeine.

The lawsuit claims that the label lacked specific instructions on proper use. 'The difference between life and death is a pinch and a smidgen,' Balser said. Hard Rhino sold the powder as a dietary supplement, which allows the company to bypass FDA regulations, Balser said.

Music can be played via apps on the Watch when connected to a phone, and this can be done either using the timepiece's built-in speaker or via Bluetooth headphones. Apple defines the battery on its Watch product\u00a0page\u00a0and said a time check typically lasts four seconds. It is likely that a notification illuminates the screen for a similar time. This means 90 time checks and 90 notifications equate to 12 hours of screen activity. When this is added to app use and workout time the total usage is 13 hours and 15 minutes. This leaves 4 hours and 45 minutes on standby. When used just as a watch, Apple said the device will last 48 hours if checked  five times an hour.

Teammate Viktor Troicki had been due to play in the doubles rubber alongside Nenad Zimonjic, but a draining five-set singles match with Croatian teen starlet Borna Coric on Friday convinced Serbia coach Bogdan Obradovic to draft in the fresher Djokovic. It was an inspired choice. The Serbian pair took less than two hours to defeat Franko Skugor and Marin Draganja 6-3, 6-4, 6-1, securing an unassailable 3-0 aggregate lead in the best of five tie after singles wins for Djokovic and Troicki over their Croatian opponents Friday. \"We wanted to finish the job today, to take advantage of the fact that we won the first singles and that was done,\" Djokovic said in quotes carried by the AFP news agency after the match. The World No 1. singles player has looked strong all week after losing in straight sets to Roger Federer at the final of the Dubai Tennis Championships seven days ago. He was cheered on by a packed and passionate home crowd at the Kraljevo Sports Center. Serbia has won the Davis Cup once before, in 2010 when it defeated Croatia on the way to the final.

England manager Roy Hodgson confirmed on Monday night that the young Tottenham star will definitely be unleashed from the start in tonight\u2019s friendly in Turin. Phil Jones is expected to operate in midfield as Hodgson tinkers with a team who have won seven out of seven this season, and Theo Walcott could return to the starting line-up. England captain Wayne Rooney has warned Harry Kane not let his full international debut be ruined by Italy . Kane celebrates after scoring his first international goal during England's 4-0 victory over Lithuania on Friday . All eyes will be on Kane, however, and Hodgson spoke of the \u2018magic touch\u2019 which has helped him score 30 goals this season, including his first for his country \u2014 within 79 seconds of his debut from the bench against Lithuania on Friday. But England captain Rooney, who is set to win his 103rd cap playing at the forward tip of a midfield diamond, warned Kane what he should expect from the likes of Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci. Rooney said: \u2018With Italian defenders, they\u2019re clever defenders. They do anything to try and stop you and you have to be aware of that, and not be frustrated. \u2018They\u2019re a passionate country who love their football and they\u2019re probably the closest in Europe to South American\u00a0teams. They\u2019ll do anything to stop you. They\u2019re tough to play against, organised, make it as difficult to play against as possible. They\u2019re the best in Europe at doing that. \u2018Harry\u2019s taking the ball and running at the defenders and getting shots at goal. \u2018That\u2019s all he has to do,\u2019 insisted Rooney, who hopes to match Tommy Lawton\u2019s record of scoring in six successive England games, set in 1938-39. \u2018I\u2019m sure if he does that the way he has, he\u2019ll be fine.\u2019 Rooney insists Italy's defenders will do anything to stop the opposition and Kane must be aware . Kane will come up against Leonardo Bonucci (pictured) and Giorgio Chiellini on Tuesday night . When Italy beat England at the World Cup in Brazil, no-one thought Kane anywhere near an international breakthrough - but he has made incredible progress. Hodgson said: \u2018It\u2019s great to see people like Harry Kane come on the scene and it\u2019s a fairytale for him at the moment. He\u2019s got the magic touch. Within 80 seconds got a goal on his debut. It doesn\u2019t get much better. This will be a tougher test, but he will start and hopefully play a large part in it. \u2018Our system will be slightly different because we had a lot of forwards available for Lithuania, but we lost Raheem Sterling and Danny Welbeck, which has changed my thinking. \u2018We still have what I consider to be a very offensive line-up. It\u2019ll be hard work for the front six, who have a hard job on their hands.\u2019 England manager Roy Hodgson (left) confirmed Kane will start against Italy and 'hopefully play a large part' James Milner and Leighton Baines have also withdrawn.

Starting on Monday, staff at the 4,700 caf\u00e9s across America will have the option to write 'RaceTogether' on cardboard cups, which is the slogan of a Starbucks anti-racism campaign. It is hoped that customers who encounter the slogan on their coffee cup will be inspired to discuss the deeper issues affecting America. Scroll down for video . Campaign: Starbucks boss Howard Schultz has instructed staff to write 'RaceTogether' on cups in an effort to draw customers into a discussion about the state of race relations in America . Talking point: Although Starbucks says that nobody will be forced into a discussion, baristas will attempt to speak to customers about racism in America by writing slogans on their coffee cups . The move is the brainchild of Howard Schultz, 61, the company's boss, who has a track record of speaking out about contentious topics, from gay marriage to gun control. His decision came in response to the escalating racial tension that emerged when grand juries failed to indict white police officers involved in the killings of Michael Brown, 18, in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner, 43, in Staten Island, New York. Last year, Schultz travelled to Starbucks branches in the cities most affected by racial tension, including Los Angeles, St Louis, Chicago, New York, Oakland and Seattle. Mr Schulz met about 2,000 Starbucks staff on the tour, and made contact with the rest of his 200,000 employees - 40 per cent of whom are from ethnic minority backgrounds - via a video address. 'It's an emotional issue,' he said. 'But it is so vitally important to the country.' Last week, the company ran full-page advertisements in the New York Times and USA Today, highlighting race tensions in the country. The page was black, with the words 'shall we overcome?' in the centre, and the company logo at the bottom. The campaign will continue on Friday, when every copy of USA Today will carry an insert about racism, which will also be stocked at branches of Starbucks. Schultz kicked off the campaign last December with a letter that appeared in TIME magazine. 'Last week, one thing became clear: we cannot continue to come to work every day aware of the difficult and painful experiences facing our nation, and not acknowledge them, together, as a company,' he wrote. 'Indeed, despite the raw emotion around the events and their underlying racial issues, we at Starbucks should be willing to talk about them.' Schultz has a track record of using his public profile to highlight issues close to his heart. In 2013, he wrote an open letter requesting customers to leave their guns at home when they visited his stores, even in states where they can be carried legally. 'We believe guns and weapons should not be part of the Starbucks experience,' he said. He also spearheaded a petition to end federal shutdown in the same year, and launched a scheme to boost job creation in the U.S. by selling bracelets in its caf\u00e9s in 2011. Starbucks is also intending to employ 10,000 former members of the armed forces and their partners over five years. Those who oppose Schultz' views get short shrift. In 2013, an investor said that the company's open support for gay marriage was harming sales. Schultz responded by suggesting that he sell his shares. Schulz will reportedly discuss the Race Together initiative at the company's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, according to\u00a0Fortune.", "reference": "Howard Schultz, boss of Starbucks, gave the order in response to the race-related violence sweeping America .\nHe went on a tour of areas affected last year, and started an anti-racism advertising campaign .\nBaristas will write 'RaceTogether' on  cups in an effort to stimulate debate .\nStarbucks claims that nobody will be forced into a discussion ."}, "252": {"id": "a2f17a1627946e4d9fb98ed61185c2c995fa6084", "article": "Scarlets boosted their European Champions Cup qualification ambitions by seeing  at Parc y Scarlets. The home side remain outside of the top six, but are now just three points behind Connacht in the battle to book a place among Europe's elite. It was a deserved win for the Llanelli-based region, who put a big dent in Leinster's play-off hopes with just five rounds of action remaining. Both sides welcomed back Six Nations squad members with British and Irish Lions prop Cian Healy making his first Leinster start since September, while Wales centre Scott Williams had not pulled on a Scarlets jersey for six weeks. And the Scarlets' vice-captain came to the fore in a bright start from the home side, which was rewarded with a penalty from fly-half Steve Shingler after 10 minutes. However, Leinster began to grow into the game as the half wore on and on 18 minutes they showed the clinical edge of champions to claim the game's opening try. After Leinster had set up an attack in the home 22, former NRL star Ben Te'o cut an exquisite angle through the Scarlets midfield before stepping his way to score at the posts. Fly-half Jimmy Gopperth landed the simple conversion. The Wasps-bound number 10 added another three points following more pressure from the visitors, but Scarlets responded strongly and crossed for their first try just before the half-hour mark. Some slick handling by the home backs had Leinster on the back foot and Scotland back-rower John Barclay did well to squeeze in at the corner - although it needed the television match official to confirm the number eight had avoided touch in the process of touching down. Shingler was short with the conversion and it meant Leinster held a slender 10-8 advantage at the interval. However, a well-worked team try from the Scarlets wiped out that advantage 11 minutes after the restart. After strong work from the forwards which took play to the Leinster line, the home side appeared to have butchered an overlap. However, they regrouped well and silky hands from Kiwi centre Regan King put full-back Jordan Williams over. A long-range Gopperth penalty reduced the arrears to two points, then it needed a try-saving tackle from Barclay to deny opposite number Jack Conan, with James Davies claiming a crucial turnover. The outstanding Barclay was then involved at the opposite end of the field, bursting through to set up the Scarlets third try, finished off with an outstretched hand by replacement Rory Pitman. Shingler couldn't land the conversion and seven points separated the sides going into the final 13 minutes. Replacement Rhys Priestland landed a penalty to put more distance between the sides and Leinster left empty handed after a score by full-back Zane Kirchner was ruled out by the TMO in the final minutes.", "reference": "Scarlets\u00a0boosted their European Champions Cup qualification ambitions .\nHosts saw off Leinster 23-13 in a rousing Guinness Pro12 clash .\nTheir victory puts a big dent in Leinster's play-off hopes at Parc y Scarlets .\nScarlets are now chasing a top six finish with Connacht three points ahead ."}, "253": {"id": "97ab25dbe30c0b2adc3b1bc777f86c07f9e1dde4", "article": "Andy Carroll has taken another step towards his recovery from a serious knee injury after coming through a spin and gym session, although the West Ham striker remains sidelined for the rest of the season.

Discovered inside a ninth century woman\u2019s grave in Sweden, the stone inset into the ring bears an inscription that says \u2018for Allah\u2019 or \u2018to Allah\u2019. While it is already known that the Vikings acquired glass in far flung lands, the artefact bolsters the \u00a0theory that the seafaring civilisation did business with Islamic traders. A ring (pictured) made over 1,000 years ago has confirmed contact between the Vikings and the Islamic world because it was unearthed in Sweden but bears an ancient Arabic inscription that asys 'for Allah' or 'to Allah' The ring was discovered during excavations of a Viking trading centre in Birka, Sweden, in the late 1800s, Science News reported. Since then, it has been thought that stone in the ring is violet amethyst, but now experts have revealed it is coloured glass \u2013 an exotic material at the time. Researchers at Stockholm University used a scanning electron microscope to determine the material and to clearly reveal ancient Arabic writing called Kufic writing, that reads \u2018for Allah or \u2018to Allah.\u2019 It is known that Scandinavians traded glass objects from Egypt and Mesopotamia up to 3,400 years ago, so it is entirely possible that the Vikings fetched glass goods from the region instead of waiting for them to make their way north via trade networks. Ancient texts also mention trades taking place between the Vikings and members of the Islamic civilisation, which stretched from the Mediterranean to West Asia, but archaeological evidence is rare. The ring was discovered during excavations of a Viking trading centre in Birka, Sweden (shown by the red marker) which lies west of Stockholm, in the late 1800s but has now been examined under a scanning electron microscope to determine the stone is exotic glass, rather than an amythest . Ancient texts mention trades taking place between the Vikings and members of the Islamic civilisation, which stretched from the Mediterranean to West Asia, but archaeological evidence is rare. An illustration of Vikings unloading goods from a longboat is shown . The study, published in the journal Scanning, says: \u2018The ring may\u2026 constitute material evidence for direct interactions between Viking Age Scandinavia and the Islamic world. \u2018Being the only ring with an Arabic inscription found at a Scandinavian archaeological site, it is a unique object among Swedish Viking Age material.\u2019 Further analysis of the ring showed that it was rarely worn. The inner ring still shows signs of where the silver was filed by a craftsman, meaning that it was probably sold as new before it became a treasured possession of a Viking woman. \u2018The ring has been cast in a high-grade silver alloy (94.5/5.5 Ag/Cu) and retains the post-casting marks from the filing done to remove flash and mould lines,\u2019 according to the study. \u2018Thus, the ring has rarely been worn, and likely passed from the silversmith to the woman buried at Birka with few owners in between.\u2019 Last year, a Viking sword was discovered in a field in Norway by aman scanning the area with a metal detector.

The 35-year-old man was one of about 30 pleasure-seekers at the 'James Bond meets Pussy Galore' event in a \u00a32.5million country mansion in the Home Counties. He is thought to have entered the pool naked with a woman he had met at the party before suddenly starting to thrash about in the water and then sinking to the bottom. Organiser\u00a0Janet Harrison (left) with \u00a0friend in an image from a website that promotes the swingers' parties . The sex party was reportedly 'just getting started' when a 35-year-old man drowned in the swimming pool of the \u00a33million gated property (pictured is a pool at the mansion) Detectives are investigating the 'unexplained' death and the 50ft covered pool has been sealed off while toxicology tests are carried out to check that the water is safe. The party was one of the regular swingers' events put on by retired management consultant Richard Stanley, 66, and his partner Janet Harrison, 58, at their eight-bedroom home in Radlett, Hertfordshire. The couple, who appeared in a Channel 4 series last year, say they do not run the sex parties as a business, but ask for contributions to their costs. The event on Friday night featured 007 references including a roulette wheel, a woman covered in gold paint inspired by Goldfinger and chocolate replicas of the weapon from The Man With The Golden Gun. The man got into difficulties in the water just after midnight. The death happened at a swingers party run by Richard Stanley and Janet Harrison, pictured in the Channel 4 documentary\u00a0Jon Richardson Grows Up . The owner of the house, who organised the sex party, said there were safety notices around the pool . 'The party was really only just getting started,' a guest told the Sun. 'I was in the garden when a naked couple walked into the heated pool. She was white and in her 30s or 40s, he was black. 'There is a steep incline in the pool, which is about 3m deep, and the guy went in deeper by himself and started whacking the water. I thought he was playing. 'After a while the woman screamed and I saw the guy lying on the bottom. His body looked like it was moving, but then I realised it was ripples in the water.' Revellers dragged the man out and performed CPR on him at the poolside, but he could not be revived and was pronounced dead at Watford General Hospital. The victim, who told other guests he was called Edmund, was not a regular at the parties. He is believed to be Nigerian and from north-west London. The woman who entered the pool with him, who was not well known by other guests, was left distraught. Mr Stanley said the victim had apparently 'severely dented' a bottle of Jack Daniel's he brought with him before entering the pool. The group's website states that there are health and safety rules for using the large indoor swimming pool . The couple have been hosting sex parties at the mansion - which includes a dungeon - for 10 years . He added: 'I heard a shout and ran over. I dived in fully clothed, pausing only to take my iPhone out of my pocket. He was enormously heavy. Three of the guys pulled him out, with me pushing him from behind. They put him straight into the CPR position and tried to revive him. One of the guests was a qualified nurse. 'I got straight on to 999. The call operator gave very clear instructions, which I shouted to the team performing CPR. We kept doing that until the ambulance arrived. 'Then the police turned up \u2013 there were about a dozen officers in total by the end of the night. After interviewing various people, the inspector said to me, 'this is a non-suspicious death'. It may well be that he had a heart attack.' The mansion boasts a sex dungeon, a dance room with a pole and a sauna for the 'hot-blooded sexual Olympians' who attend the parties. Mr Stanley and his partner decided to go ahead with a planned Alice In Wonderland-themed party on Saturday night after receiving messages of support from their regular guests. The property features a converted attic which Mr Stanley calls the 'dungeon in the sky' The tragedy struck in the early hours of Saturday at the mansion (pictured) in Radlett, north of London . The mansion's owners say the pool complies with all health and safety rules and has been inspected . 'My first reaction was that having a party the following night was not going to be appropriate,' Mr Stanley said. 'But we had so many supportive emails and texts saying things like, 'the first thing you do if you fall off a horse is get back on it', and 'it was what he would have wanted'. 'Somebody said when a plane crashes into the Alps, you don't stop all aviation. You sit down around a table and think about whether you could have done anything differently. 'That's what we are doing. The health and safety people will come over this week and we will go through what we could do better.' Mr Stanley said he would invite the victim's friends and family to visit his house and set up a memorial there if they wished. A Hertfordshire Police spokesman said: 'An investigation is on-going at this time to establish the circumstances surrounding the man's death, which is being treated as unexplained pending the outcome of a post-mortem.

Investigators say a gunbattle apparently broke out as Pierce, a human resources employee at Kaiser Permanente, was heading home after picking up her kids from school.

Maybe you and your pals slipped a pig into the building or greased all the door handles or turned all the chairs upside-down. So it's no surprise that Wichita high school Principal Sherman Padgett was reluctant to play along last week when a student showed up and told him to stand in the hallway holding a bucket. \"She didn't say anything about why. She just said 'hold the bucket,' \" the North High School principal told CNN affiliate KWCH. \"I'm not going to hold the bucket unless I have a little inkling of why it could be.\" Good thing he changed his mind. Once he did, student after student streamed by, dropping notes of praise and thanks into the bucket. \"Thank you for making high school the best years of my life,\" one said. \"You've made my first year experience in America one that I will always fondly remember,\" read another. One student recalled how Padgett \"helped me get through my eating disorder and helped me get into therapy.\" The notes were the idea of senior Emily Jones. She decided she wanted to do something nice for the principal and cooked up the plan with her mother. \"Padgett's an awesome principal,\" she said. For Padgett, who has been principal at North since 2006, the experience was priceless. \"Became a little emotional on some of them,\" he said, \"I kind of read them and thought, 'man, this is better than a paycheck.

In fact, at Coventry City, the midfielder found the experience of being an inferior player to a manager in his early 40s about as palatable as Strachan\u2019s famed longevity-fuelling concoction of porridge, bananas and seaweed. If O\u2019Neill\u2019s injury-scarred spell at Highfield Road was not the most notable of an otherwise successful career, the Northern Ireland manager retains a high regard for his Scotland counterpart and hopes the pair can soon share success in the international arena. Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill has been preparing his side to face Gordon Strachan's Scotland . Strachan's side will be hoping to go into their Euro 2016 qualifier against Gibraltar on the back of a win . Scotland have not qualified for a major tournament since France 98, while Northern Ireland have not been seen at a Finals since the days when Brazil\u2019s Josimar rocketed one of the all-time great World Cup goals past Pat Jennings. But on the road to France 2016, Scotland are third in Group D, while Northern Ireland are second in Group F. As the two nations face off in a friendly at Hampden, O\u2019Neill hopes both men can lead their respective countries out of the international wilderness. \u2018I played under Gordon at Coventry \u2014 it\u2019s always a concern when the manager is a better player than you,\u2019 quipped the 45-year-old former Dundee United and Hibs midfielder. \u2018Other than that it was fine. It was a bit unfortunate that injuries thwarted my opportunity at Coventry but it was evident back then what type of manager Gordon was going to be. \u2018He had the ability to motivate and to invigorate. He knew how to get players to respond to him. So it doesn\u2019t surprise me how well he has done with Scotland. He was a great appointment and exactly what Scotland needed at that time. Scotland national team boss Strachan, pictured in 2001, coached O'Neill during his time as Coventry manager . \u2018It\u2019s pretty evident the improvement they have made under Gordon. And having played half my career up here, it would be good to see both countries qualify for the Euros. \u2018We\u2019ve been nearly 30 years away from a major tournament. Scotland haven\u2019t quite had that to deal with - but I\u2019d love to see both countries do it.\u2019 O\u2019Neill still lives in Edinburgh and remains an avid viewer of the Scottish game, not just because it is home to several Northern Ireland internationals. He believes football in this country is in ruder health than many outsiders \u2013 and insiders \u2013\u00a0perceive amid the often unrelenting negativity that has accompanied the collapse and pained rise of Rangers. \u2018I watch Scottish football a lot,\u2019 said O\u2019Neill, who may not risk Aberdeen striker Niall McGinn\u2019s hamstring but could start with two Manchester United centre backs in Jonny Evans and debutant Paddy McNair. \u2018There are now potential internationals of the future getting their chance in first-teams in the Premiership and Championship and that can only be good for the Scotland national team. \u2018There\u2019s been too much negativity about Scottish football at times, obviously because of what\u2019s gone on at certain clubs. But the game is in a lot healthier state than people give it credit for.\u2019 Manchester United team-mates Jonny Evans and Paddy McNair are expected to start in defence . For Northern Ireland captain Steven Davis, a return to Hampden will bring back fond memories of his last appearance in Mount Florida. Back in March 2011, he scored the opening goal as Rangers beat Celtic 2-1 in extra time to lift the League Cup \u2013 the club\u2019s last major trophy before administration then liquidation visited Ibrox and leading players including Davis quit. \u2018It will be nice to be back at Hampden,\u2019 said the 30-year-old Southampton midfielder. \u2018It holds special memories for me. We had a lot of success there with Rangers but my last game, the League Cup Final, stands out. Celtic were always kind of favourites before we went into any Old Firm game and they had the upper hand before that game. But I scored a goal and we won the cup that day. \u2018I was lucky to have four years at Rangers and it was disappointing how it ended. That was the hardest thing to take. But I\u2019ll always look back on it as one of the most important and enjoyable periods in my career. Southampton midfielder Steven Davis, pictured in Janaury 2012, returns to his former stomping ground . \u2018It\u2019s a bit of an impossible subject to talk about (leaving) because you\u2019re never going to please everybody with what you say. But the honesty of it is we could only try and make a decision based on what we thoughts was best at the time and you have to live by that.\u2019 As he turns back the clock by returning to Glasgow, however, Davis feels the future is bright now that Ibrox is back in the ownership of \u2018Rangers men\u2019 like Dave King and Paul Murray. And the former Rangers captain, who played in the 2008 UEFA Cup Final with the Ibrox side, hopes the hiring of nine-in-a-row idol Stuart McCall can kick-starts a Rangers revival back towards past glories. \u2018I think (the boardroom change) is positive for the club. For any fan, it\u2019s nice to see people in charge who have the best interests of the club at heart. \u2018We all knew it was going to be a difficult period but nobody could have foreseen just how hard it was going to be. \u2018But I think Stuart McCall is going to be a good appointment. It was great to see him get that first win on Sunday at Hibs. Hopefully Rangers can build on that and get even stronger. \u2018Would I ever go back to Rangers? In football you never know. But it\u2019s a club I look back on fondly and if the opportunity arose it would be something I\u2019d have to consider.\u2019", "reference": "Michael O'Neill worked under Gordon Strachan during his time at Coventry .\nNorthern Ireland boss O'Neill is looking forward to facing Strachan's side .\nO'Neill's side take on Scotland in friendly match before Finland qualifier ."}, "263": {"id": "486545d689fdf06bc5638eb605016bfaaa183f7c", "article": "Bayern Munich fielded a non-German goalkeeper in the Bundesliga for the first time since 1988, as Pepe Reina replaced Manuel Neuer in a 4-0 win over Werder Bremen. The former Liverpool man signed for Bayern in the summer, and his debut in the German top flight also makes him the first goalkeeper to play in all four of Europe's top leagues. Robert Lewandowski took the plaudits, scoring twice as Bayern showed no signs of letting up at the top of the Bundesliga, swatting Werder Bremen aside with ease in a bad-tempered match that threatened to get out of hand.

Reina directs his team-mates as he became the first goalkeeper ever to play in all four of Europe's top leagues . The game threatened to boil over after a series of strong challenges saw the referee dish out yellow cards . Werder were undone by three goals from counter-attacks and a David Alaba free-kick, but did enough to rile the visitors to the point that defender Jerome Boateng, one of six players booked, became involved in an argument with a ball boy. Runaway leaders Bayern, who have 64 points from 25 games, are now 14 clear of second-placed Wolfsburg who host Freiburg on Sunday afternoon. Pep Guardiola's side, who have scored 34 goals in their last eight games in all competitions and thumped Werder 6-0 earlier in the season, went ahead in the 24th minute when Thomas Muller curled the ball in from the edge of the area following a counter-attack. Despite missing Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben through injury, the leaders were as clinical as ever and Alaba chipped in a free kick in the last minute of the first half to make it 2-0.

Werder had a goal disallowed for handball by Sebastian Proedl in the second half, although the Austrian appeared to be pushed by Boateng, and the game turned ugly with several late tackles and heated exchanges between the players. Almost inevitably Werder were caught on the break when Lewandowski grabbed two goals in the final quarter of an hour, both set up by Mueller after lightning attacks. 'We tried everything and attacked with courage for part of the game,' said Werder coach Viktor Skrypnyk. 'Overall it wasn't a bad performance, at least it was better than the 6-0 defeat.'

'Mohammed, Messenger of God' is a film about the Prophet's childhood but doesn't show his face with the other characters telling his story. The project was filmed in Iran with a replica of the Kaaba shrine in Saudi Arabia built in the remote village of Allahyar especially for the epic making it the country's most expensive film. Iranian filmmaker Majid Maijidi leads the crew through a scene while filming 'Mohammed, Messenger of God', a new film about the Prophet Mohammed . Replica buildings of Mecca in Saudi Arabia were created for the film's set in the village of Allahyar, south of Tehran . But despite the film yet to receive its release, it has been widely criticised, as Islamic clerics agree that trying to depict the Prophet Mohammed is forbidden. Already Egypt has called for a ban on the film saying it debases the sanctity of the messengers from God, while Qatar has announced plans to shot its own film about the prophet's life. But the film's director Majid Majidi has insisted the movie will five the right impression of Mohammed's life. He said: 'Many relay their messages to the world through cinema and pictures. 'We are ready to co-operate to produce any movies to introduce Mohammed to the world. 'We are an Islamic country, we know the related culture and we have capabilities for such production.' The film is the most expensive to be made in the country and depicts the Prophet Mohammed by showing the back of his head . The film appears to have gained the support of Iran's current supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Kharmenei, who attended the set in 2012 . Islamic tradition is full of written descriptions of Mohammed and his qualities, describing him as the ideal human being. But many finding depicting the prophet offensive with the the satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo targeted by gunman in the Paris terror attacks, killing 12 people, over its caricature of Mohammed. However, the film appears to have gained the support of Ayatollah Ali Kharmenei, Iran's current supreme leader, who attended and inauguration of the film's set in 2012.

Mohammed Mahdi Heidarian, head of the private Nourtaban Film Industry company, confirmed that his firm had spent $30million on the film.

The demonstrators have called for President Dilma Rousseff to be impeached. CNN correspondent Shasta Darlington, who lives in Sao Paulo, explains who the demonstrators are, why they're mad and what could be in store for the President and the country. What do the protesters want? They're angry about the country's economy being in shambles at a time when political corruption at the highest levels of government is alleged. If it were just one of those things, maybe we wouldn't be seeing this kind of turnout because Brazilians have lived with corruption for decades and the economy was not doing well before the presidential election in October. But it's all come to a head. Political corruption -- let's break that down. What's the scandal about? Petrobras is the national oil company. It's one of the most powerful, richest companies in the country -- and has been counted among the largest in the world. It was very respected. People invested in it. Rousseff, who won election in October by a slim margin, was -- before becoming President -- the chairwoman of Petrobras' board of directors. She was chairwoman during much of the time that former oil company executives have told investigators that bribes were paid to Petrabras executives and politicians in order to secure contracts from Petrobras. In early March, the country's highest court authorized the investigation which involves about 40 politicians, many of them from the President's ruling Workers' Party and the speakers of the House and Senate. But Rousseff hasn't been accused of anything, right? Right. She's not being investigated. Protesters' call for impeachment -- the formal process of accusing, because she's not been accused of anything -- looks very unlikely. But, the public perception is that even if she didn't personally profit for this scheme, she was still the chairwoman at a time when it was supposedly happening and she should be held accountable. Has she responded to the protesters? She has. What she says is that she will not stand for corruption and she's rooting it out. As proof, she contends, she's given her attorney general free rein to investigate who is stealing from the state oil company. It's important to know that the Petrobras scandal has been known publicly for at least a year and during Rousseff's election campaign, she said over and over that she would root out corruption. It's also interesting that she isn't lashing out at protesters. She is saying she won't put up with violence -- and so far the protests haven't gotten violent. But she says that Brazil is a democratic country and people have the right to protest. She comes from a left-wing background so that approach is fitting. You brought up that she is from the left-wing Workers' Party. How is that significant? The protests were mostly organized by the right-wing party that opposes Rousseff...organized by people who didn't vote for her. There aren't people out today protesting. The next demonstrations are scheduled for April 12. I guess that goes to how organized these demonstrations really are -- setting an advance date like that. Yes, well, that's Brazil. It's so the word can get out on social media. If she's not accused of anything and the protests are politically motivated, will the protests affect her presidency? Rousseff has four years ahead of her, it could end up being very hard for her govern. She won a little over half the vote in October and the people who didn't vote for her are still making their voices heard. And this Petrobras scandal is a problem. Why was the election so close? You have to bring it back to the economy. It had been slowing down, and traditionally the wealthier parts of the country like Sao Paulo haven't voted for Rousseff's party, the Workers' Party. The country is at 7.5% inflation. The April 12 protest is ahead but three or four months down the road, what might happen? The Senate and House speakers are Rousseff's allies and they are among those implicated in the Petrobras scheme. What if she isn't able to get badly needed legislation? What will she do? What will be party do? These questions are hard to answer now.

The result leaves the Black Cats one point and one place above the drop zone and owner Ellis Short believes a change of manager is needed to avoid relegation. Poyet \u2013 who leaves after 17 months in charge \u2013 was informed of the club\u2019s decision having taken training at the Academy of Light on Monday morning. Gus Poyet has been sacked by Sunderland with the club just one point above the relegation zone . Sunderland fans turned on manager Poyet during the defeat by Aston Villa on Saturday . Sportsmail reported earlier in the day that influential sporting director Lee Congerton had advised Short to sack Poyet. A statement on the club's website confirmed the news on Monday afternoon, in which Short said: 'I would like to thank Gus for his endeavours during his time at the club, in particular last season\u2019s \"great escape\" and cup final appearance, which will live long in the memory of every Sunderland fan. Goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon looks dejected as Sunderland were thrashed at home by Villa . Gabriel Agbonlahor scored two of Aston Villa's goals in the 4-0 win on Saturday . 525 - Poyet's number of days in charge since his arrival on October 8, 2013. 75 - The Uruguayan's number of games in charge, winning 23, losing 22 and drawing 30. 3 - The number of games against bitter rivals Newcastle. He won them all with an aggregate of 6-1. 35 - Poyet was the 35th man to manage Sunderland either permanently or as a caretaker. 22 - The number of years between Sunderland's appearances in a major final. Poyet took them to the 2014 Capital One Cup final, 22 years on from their defeat to Liverpool in the FA Cup showpiece. They lost to Manchester City. 14 - Sunderland's final position in Poyet's first season. 4 - The amount of games won in the Premier League by Sunderland this season. The joint-worst with bottom side Leicester. 'Sadly, we have not made the progress that any of us had hoped for this season and we find ourselves battling, once again, at the wrong end of the table. We have therefore made the difficult decision that a change is needed.' Poyet\u2019s position had become untenable after a breakdown in relationship with Congerton and the club\u2019s fans, thousands of whom streamed for the exits with the team trailing by four at half-time against Villa. A handful of supporters even tried to storm the dugout while some targeted the directors\u2019 box \u2013 including chief executive Margaret Byrne - leaving the club hierarchy in no doubt that a change was necessary. Holland boss Dick Advocaat has already spoken to the club about a short-term deal until the end of the season and he could be installed before Saturday\u2019s trip to West Ham. Congerton is close to Frank Arnesen \u2013 they worked together at Chelsea and Hamburg \u2013 and he is thought to have recommended Advocaat for the role. The new man will inherit a team which has won just once in 12 matches and is without a home goal in more than five hours. Poyet leaves Sunderland after just over a year in charge . Poyet was appointed by Sunderland in October 2013 following the sacking of\u00a0Paolo Di Canio . They were dumped out of the FA Cup by League One Bradford City last month and away fans fought among themselves at Valley Parade. Bizarrely, Poyet blamed the Press for Sunderland\u2019s woes after that game but his excuses did not wash with supporters. Former Rangers and Holland manager Dick Advocaat is one name in the frame to take over . The goodwill generated by last season\u2019s League Cup final appearance and their escape from relegation in the final weeks of the campaign had long since evaporated and few fans will be mourning his departure. Poyet\u2019s backroom team of Mauricio Taricco and Charlie Oatway are also expected to leave the club.

The 33-year-old, who sought asylum in Australia in 2010 before securing residency two years later, is one of 17 players selected for both the five-Test series and a preceding tour of the West Indies. Ahmed took 48 wickets during Victoria's triumphant Sheffield Shield campaign, catching the eye of national selector Rod Marsh, who feels the spinner can make life difficult for England's batsmen when the Ashes series starts in July. Fawad Ahmed celebrates after taking eight wickets for Victoria in the Sheffield Shield final last week . Ahmed bats for Victoria during the Sheffield Shield final with Western Australia in Hobart . 'Him being a leg-spinner as opposed to a finger spinner gave him a slight advantage,' Marsh said at a press conference organised to announce the squad. 'Believe it or not, Australia is always looking for leg-spinners. We've had a proud history of leg-spinning in this country and we want that to continue. '(Ahmed) doesn't bowl too much rubbish and he creates a lot of pressure. 'He has men around the bat in most instances and he keeps asking the batsmen questions, which is what good spinners do. 'He maintains good economy and asks questions of both left and right-handers, bearing in mind that England may have up to seven left-handers.' Ahmed pictured during a one-day international with England at Old Trafford in September 2013 . Ahmed has caught the eye of Australian selector Rod Marsh (left), seen here with Adam Gilchrist . There was no place for all-rounder Glenn Maxwell despite his World Cup heroics but Adam Voges, the scorer of 1358 runs in Shield cricket last season, will be on the plane departing for the West Indies on May 19. One-day specialist Maxwell, named in the International Cricket Council's team of the tournament following Sunday's triumph over New Zealand in Melbourne, made only 41 runs and failed to take a wicket against Pakistan in his last Test appearance for the Baggy Green back in October. Marsh said of Voges: 'I looked at him on four or more occasions and I thought 'I don't know how anyone will get this bloke out', he was that dominant. 'It wasn't just the 1300-odd runs, it was the way he made them. 'It was as good a Sheffield Shield batting as I have ever seen. Pure weight of runs, the way in which he got those runs, you could see Test player written all over him.' Adam Voges, seen here playing for Western Australia, has been selected after an excellent season . Glenn Maxwell has not been picked in the squad despite helping Australia to World Cup success . While fast bowler Ryan Harris is included, he will remain in Australia throughout the tour of the West Indies, which begins in Dominica on June 5, as he anticipates the birth of his first child. After the second Test in Jamaica - scheduled to conclude on June 17 - he will travel to the United Kingdom to reunite with his team-mates ahead of the first Ashes Test at Sophia Gardens in Cardiff on July 8. James Pattinson misses the trip to the Caribbean due to an injured left hamstring but will be observed over the coming weeks and may become an option later in the Australian winter. New South Wales wicket-keeper Peter Nevill is included in a Test squad for the first time after scoring 764 runs throughout the Shield campaign. Ryan Harris has been selected but will miss the tour of the West Indies prior to the Ashes . 'Peter Nevill has been on our radar for some time and deserves his opportunity through weight of runs and performances behind the stumps,' said Marsh. 'He has also demonstrated impressive leadership qualities which have caught our eye.' Also travelling are skipper Michael Clarke and his vice-captain Steve Smith, Brad Haddin, Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Johnson and Nathan Lyon. Shaun Marsh, Mitchell Marsh, Chris Rogers, Peter Siddle, Mitchell Starc, David Warner and Shane Watson complete the selection. Marsh told cricketaustralia.com: 'The Test team has performed very well in recent times, but the big challenge is to do that away from home.

But  a top researcher says we've been giving ourselves too much credit - because we were helped by our oldest friends. Humans paired up with dogs as early as 40,000 BC, it is claimed, giving us such an advantage in hunting that it prompted the wipeout of our Neanderthal rivals. Man's best friend: An early cave painting in Libya of dogs chasing a deer in the Akakus Mountains. A new theory claims humans teamed up with the ancestors of domestic dogs far earlier than was first thought . Left behind: While early humans hunted with wolves, their Neanderthal rivals in Europe continued using primitive tools without any help, according to anthropologist Dr Pat Shipman (artist's impression) The controversial theory has been put forward in a new book by leading anthropologist Pat Shipman of\u00a0Pennsylvania State University. She has challenged the common scientific view that wolves were only domesticated just over 10,000 years ago, after early humans had already asserted a strong foothold in Europe. No match: The theory claims Neanderthals (model pictured) were no match for the hunting technique . Instead, she said, humans began taming and breeding wolves - leading to the pets we know today - soon after they arrived on the continent from Africa up to 70,000 years ago. At the time, our close genetic relatives the Neanderthals were dominant in Europe, fighting for survival as they hunted creatures such as woolly mammoths with primitive tools. But soon afterwards the rival species died out, leaving a clear path for the homo sapiens that make up today's humans. Strong rival theories of their demise include that Neanderthals, just like woolly mammoths, were unable to cope with the changing climate of the last ice age or that humans were better hunters. Dr Shipman, however, told The Observer: 'We formed an alliance with the wolf and that would have been the end for the Neanderthal. 'Early wolf-dogs would have tracked and harassed animals like elk and bison and would have hounded them until they tired. Then humans would have killed them with spears or bows and arrows. 'This meant the dogs did not need to approach these large cornered animals to finish them off \u2013 often the most dangerous part of a hunt \u2013 while humans didn\u2019t have to expend energy in tracking and wearing down prey. Dogs would have done that. 'Then we shared the meat. It was a win-win situation.' Dr Shipman's theory, shared in her book The Invaders: How Humans and Their Dogs Drove Neanderthals to Extinction, was partly inspired by early dog remains. Crossing paths: Wolves and woolly mammoths co-existed for millennia, but only wolves survived in the end . Close relation: A Natural History museum employee examines a model of a Neanderthal during an exhibition last year. Neanderthals look similar to modern humans but were a distinct species with genetic differences . She examined 33,000-year-old fossils of dogs found in Siberia and Belgium, and looked at how the shapes of their jaws and skulls were different from wild wolves. Although they were far more similar to wolves than the pets of today, there were clear signs of domestication, she said - including shorter snouts, densely-packed teeth and wider jaws. The theory is the latest in a long line about our prehistoric ancestors, many of which contradict each other. Last year a study at the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany claimed early humans emigrated from Africa far earlier than we first thought - and as many as 130,000 years ago. Another study at the University of Chicago said wolves began evolving into domestic dogs between 9,000 and 34,000 years ago, while a third study said dogs may not have evolved from wolves as we know them today at all.", "reference": "Neanderthals were wiped out after ancient humans arrived from Africa .\nScientists  disagree on why - but top anthropologist may have the answer .\nDr Pat Shipman said we paired up with wolves in symbiotic partnership .\nWolves cornered prey and humans made the kill, sharing meat afterwards .\nNeanderthals were then 'no match' for humans' superior hunting tactics ."}, "274": {"id": "2913bdc11ae475d1d6237ae40c22367221948893", "article": "Fighting for life: Connor Lynes was found collapsed on his bedroom floor morning after his rugby match .

Mr Balls said the coalition spent \u00a37 billion over the last five years cutting the main rate of corporation tax to the benefit of larger firms while revenues from business rates rose by \u00a33 billion, at an average cost to firms of \u00a31,500-a-year. Will Straw, the son of former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, was out campaigning in Blackburn today. He is standing for Parliament in the Rossendale and Darwen constituency . Mr Balls added: 'Unleashing the potential of smaller businesses to grow, create more good jobs and raise living standards is a vital part of Labour's better plan. 'This is part of our plan to deliver a simpler and fairer tax system for small businesses. This is the right priority when money is tight. And it will mean that the tax burden on small businesses will be lower with Labour than under the Tories.' However the move risks re-opening the rift with some big business leaders who have strongly criticised Labour's spending plans. It comes after some company bosses complained at the way comments they had made expressing concern about the prospect of Britain leaving the EU were included in a Labour advertisement attacking the Conservatives. Mr Cameron \u2013 who this morning set out the Conservative pledge to boost employment by two million over the next five years \u2013 told Sky News's Sunrise that Labour's plan to raise corporation tax was 'a crazy thing to do when the economy is growing'. Tory Treasury minister David Gauke said that abandoning the cut in corporation tax would jeopardise economic security. He said: 'This would be the first time corporation tax has risen in over 40 years and Labour's plans could cost 96,400 jobs - it would put people's economic security at risk. 'The Conservative Party is helping businesses small and large as part of our long-term economic plan - we don't divide them up for the sake of making a political point.'", "reference": "Ed Balls unveiled proposal to cut business rates for millions of small firms .\nBut it will be paid for by reversing the Coalition's 1p corporation tax cut .\nThe PM said it was 'crazy' to hike corporation tax for first time in 40 years .\nMr Cameron claimed the tax increase would cost\u00a096,400 jobs ."}, "276": {"id": "35ebbba7a05721350fcc277d3355846c0c20b5c4", "article": "Scott Hall, who suffered from Rasmussen's Syndrome, died from a brain haemorrhage nine days after he was attacked by two teenagers . A teenager changed his Facebook status to \u2018full-time killer\u2019 after a disabled man he attacked later died of a brain haemorrhage. Scott Hall died 11 days after he was punched to the ground and repeatedly kicked by the 15-year-old and an accomplice of the same age in an unprovoked attack. But despite one of the attackers taking to Facebook to mock his victim \u2013 who was known to the youth\u2019s family \u2013 and calling himself a killer, the pair walked free from court yesterday. They were given community orders and told to attend a rehabilitation programme. The sentence followed the Crown Prosecution Service\u2019s insistence that it could not link the attack to 28-year-old Mr Hall\u2019s death. His family criticised the decision not to charge the youths over the death and said \u2018the punishment should fit the crime\u2019. Instead, the teenagers were taken to court to face the lesser charge of assault causing actual bodily harm. Newton Aycliffe magistrates\u2019 court was told that Mr Hall, who had both physical and learning difficulties, lived his final days in terror following the attack. He was confronted by the youths in Newton Hall, Durham, last July, beaten up and left unconscious. He was taken to hospital and later released. Nine days later his mother found him lying at the foot of the stairs at the family home in Framwellgate Moor, Durham. Despite being taken back to hospital and regaining consciousness, he died two days later. An inquest found that a \u2018blunt force trauma\u2019 led to Mr Hall\u2019s death from a brain haemorrhage but said it could find no evidence the attack was directly linked. The youths, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, initially denied the assault but admitted the offence at the magistrates\u2019 court on Wednesday. The victim\u2019s sister Zoe Hall, 25, told the court: \u2018[The defendants\u2019] actions resulted in him being frightened for the last week of his life. He was constantly upset and couldn\u2019t understand why someone would want to hurt him.\u2019 Thugs: Scott Hall was kicked as he lay on the ground outside Newton Hall Library (pictured) in Durham . Chris Atkinson, prosecuting, said Mr Hall had been trying to walk away from a verbal altercation with his attackers when he was pounced on. He said: \u2018He was punched in the face. That knocked him to the ground and witnesses describe both young men kicking him while he was on the ground.\u2019 Witnesses ran to Mr Hall\u2019s aid before he was taken to hospital and later released. \u2018Mr Hall suffered from Rasmussen\u2019s Syndrome, which affected his balance, speech and the way he walked,\u2019 said Mr Atkinson. \u2018His disability must have been apparent to his attackers.\u2019 The youths, now 16, had no previous convictions and were said to be remorseful. Mr Hall\u2019s family discovered they would not be charged with causing his death at an earlier hearing in January. At a hearing at Newton Aycliffe Magistrates' Court (pictured), both teenagers pleaded guilty to assaulting Mr Hall and were given community orders . At the time his mother Carol Hall, 56, said: \u2018I\u2019m totally gutted. The punishment should fit the crime.\u2019 A CPS spokesman said: \u2018The coroner found no evidence to link the death of Mr Hall with an alleged assault some two weeks before.\u2019 The mother of the teenager who boasted of being a killer said: \u2018I don\u2019t know why he attacked Scott, he has never been able to explain it. 'I knew some of Scott\u2019s family quite well and it\u2019s hard to describe how sorry I am. \u2018It has devastated us as a family but of course nowhere near the suffering the Hall family has experienced. \u2018They could never prove there was any link between the attack and Scott\u2019s death but we all know the attack shouldn\u2019t have happened.\u2019", "reference": "Scott Hall, 28, died from brain haemorrhage days after he was attacked .\nDisabled man was punched in the face and kicked as he lay on pavement .\nHe spent nine days living in terror before sudden bleed to brain and death .\nTwo 15-year-olds admitted attacking Mr Hall but they will not be jailed .\nBoth were given 12-month referral orders, rehab and community service ."}, "277": {"id": "d60a25f0f82756abb2a7e5446f11bba55cff2483", "article": "Life on Earth may have been kickstarted by a series of chemical reactions triggered by two simple but poisonous compounds that were plentiful on our planet four billion years ago. Chemists claim they may have finally solved the riddle of how life first got going on Earth. They have found it is possible to create the three main molecular building blocks of life - DNA, proteins and lipids - from hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen sulphide and ultraviolet light. Meteorite impacts, like the one in the illustration above, may have triggered the creation of hydrogen cyanide that scientists have found can create the three basic building blocks of light in reactions powered by sunlight . Their findings suggest that the basic components for biological cells could have all occurred simultaneously in primordial ponds and streams, coming together to form the first cells. This suggests that life may well have first emerged here on Earth - out of a toxic soup of poisonous gas - rather than being carried to our planet by a comet or meteorite from outer space. RNA stands for ribonucleic acid. It is one of three important molecules that are essential for all known forms of life - as well as proteins and lipids. RNA is formed from strings of nucleic acids, the same building blocks that create DNA. Genetic information in a cell flows from DNA through RNA to proteins. DNA is considered the 'blueprint' of the cell and RNA is what helps translate it. Some life, like viruses, only use RNA and it is thought that some of the earliest organisms on Earth used this molecule. Proteins are considered to be the workhorses of the cell built up from strings of amino acids. These carry out the biochemical reactions that take place in the cell and make life tick. Lipids are fatty molecules that line up in formation that can create protective vesicles. They form the membrane 'walls' of every living cell and give them structure. They are also essential for sending signals out of the cell. But the researchers behind the new study say that meteorite impacts probably still played a key role in giving life a first leg up on the ladder towards existence. They claim that meteorite impacts around four billion years ago - known as the Late Heavy Bombardment - could have carried with them carbon rich material that reacted with nitrogen in the air to produce an abundance of hydrogen cyanide. This poisonous gas could then have dissolved in water and undergone a series of chemical reactions, along with hydrogen sulphide, driven by ultraviolet light. Professor John Sutherland, a chemist at the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge who led the study said: 'Although it necessarily has to be painted with broad brushstrokes, the picture that emerges is of an overall reaction network developing over time in separate streams and pools, according to a dynamic flow chemistry scheme. 'The various products would be synthesized by subtle variations in the flow-chemistry history of the streams and the order in which they merged or ran into pools. 'Although the overall scheme would not involve all the steps of the reaction network taking place simultaneously in \u2018one pot\u2019, the various products would end up mixed together in pools.' Scientists have long believed that the building blocks for life first began occurring one after another although the debate for which came first has been controversial. Meteorite fragments and bedrock in craters like this one could have reacted with hydrogen cyanide dissolved in pools of water to create salts that react with heat and ultraviolet light to create RNA, lipids and amino acids . The researchers behind the new paper propose a number of geochemical steps shown above that could have seen hydrogen cyanide start a series of reactions that led to the creation of amino acids, nucleic acids and lipids necessary for life. First the hydrogen cyanide is dissoved in water (a) and then reacts with metals to create salts (b). These are left behind by evaporation and then undergo changes due to geothermal heating (c). The resulting molecules are swept away by steams and accumulate in ponds where they react further (d). The researchers behind the latest study, which is published in the journal Nature Chemistry, found they could make nucleic acids - a precursor for RNA and DNA - from hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen sulphide and UVlight. They also found the same basic ingredients could also lead to the creation of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, and lipids which form the protective membranes around biological cells. The conditions necessary to create all of these were found to be the same, meaning a single set of chemical reactions could have given rise to life's basic building blocks simultaneously. Professor Sutherland and his colleagues argue that the early Earth would have been a favourable setting for these reactions. Hydrogen sulphide is thrown out in volcanic eruptions like the one above and may have been a vital ingredient in the formation of the first biological building blocks needed to create living cells, according to new research . One of the great mysteries shrouding the origins of life on Earth is how complex organisms began to take shape. Theory should hold that 'short' fragments of genetic material would have reproduced in abundance, leaving longer strands - and thus complex life - behind. But new research has revealed that longer strands may have thrived in volcanic 'pores' on the young Earth - ultimately allowing life to evolve to the complexity we see today. The research was carried out by a team from the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet (LMU) in Munich and published in the journal Nature. They found that water-filled micropores in hot rocks may have acted as the nurseries in which life on Earth began. One crucial precondition for the origin of life is that comparatively simple biomolecules must have had opportunities to form more complex structures. These, in turn, had to be capable of reproducing themselves, storing genetic information in a chemically stable form. Creating longer strands of RNA to store this genetic information would have been essential - but it simply wouldn't have been possible in most conditions on Earth. But LMU physicists led by Dr Dieter Braun showed experimentally that pore systems on the seafloor that were heated by volcanic activity, namely hydrothermal vents, could have served as reaction chambers for this RNA. Hydrogen cyanide would have formed in large amounts due to the bombardment of comets raining down on the Earth a few hundred million years after it formed. Hydrogen sulphide was also thought to be common on the early Earth - thrown out by volcanic eruptions - while the sun would have provided more than enough ultraviolet light. Metal containing minerals that could have catalysed the reactions were also abundant while metal meteorites could also have caused the formation of other crucial elements like phosphate. In their paper, the scientists set out a series of geochemical scenarios that would have led the reactions in different directions to produce each of the necessary building blocks. Evaporation for example could have caused salts for form that could have then been washed into streams where solar radiation would have driven further chemical reactions. Over time the different products would have been mixed together as streams met and mingled into pools. Jack Szostak, a molecular biologist who studies the origin of life at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and was not involved in the study, told the journal Science: 'This is a very important paper. 'It proposes for the first time a scenario by which almost all of the essential building blocks for life could be assembled in one geological setting.'", "reference": "Scientists created precursors to RNA, proteins and lipids in basic reactions .\nTheir tests used hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen sulphide and ultraviolet light .\nThese chemicals would have been plentiful on the Earth 4 billion years ago .\nHydrogen cyanide would have been created by  meteorite debris reacting with the nitrogen in the Earth's atmosphere during repeated space impacts .\nHydrogen sulphide gas was probably thrown out by erupting volcanoes .\nThe research was conducted by chemists at the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge ."}, "278": {"id": "202a80df00820225013b552f8d3b017445248139", "article": "Kendall Jenner flaunts her bikini body and cozies up to Justin Bieber in a new Vogue spread, which also features Gigi Hadid, Ansel Elgort, Dylan Penn and her younger brother Hopper.

The deadly attack on the prominent Bardo Museum near Tunisia's parliament in the country's capital, Tunis, is the latest instance of an armed assault carried out by gunmen willing to fight to the death, a tactic that has been widely adopted by jihadist terrorists in recent years, including in North Africa. Such attacks mimic the 2008 Mumbai assaults in which 10 gunmen from Pakistan went on a rampage in the massive Indian port city. They took hostages and killed more than 160 people over a three-day period, in an attack that drew  sustained global TV coverage. The gunmen attacked iconic Mumbai targets such as the Taj hotel, which is frequented by Westerners. The Mumbai gunmen embarked on their attack knowing that it was a \"fedayeen\" mission -- meaning \"those who sacrifice themselves\" -- and that they would probably fight to the death. Only one gunman survived. In this week's Tunisia attack, the gunmen took hostages, two gunmen died in the assault, and three survived and are being hunted by the Tunisian government. Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid said the attackers at the Bardo Museum had specifically targeted tourists to hurt the country's economy. This seems a likely outcome of the attack, as tourism is vital to Tunisia's economy, providing 15% of GDP. Tunisia is also the only country where the Arab Spring produced a successful, lasting democratic transition, making it attractive to tourists who are avoiding going to countries like Egypt, which did not weather the Arab Spring as well as Tunisia. Already, some tour companies are canceling excursions to Tunis. In January, in Tunisia's neighbor Libya, the local branch of ISIS mounted a similar attack on the upscale Corinthia Hotel in the capital, Tripoli. Two gunmen, one of them a Tunisian, killed 10 people, including an American. Both gunmen died in the attack. This attack served ISIS' purposes of sowing greater instability in Libya and expunging Western influence from the country, as the hotel was where many foreign businessmen stayed. A senior US official told one of us that the U.S. intelligence community estimates that jihadist terrorist groups such as ISIS now control a twelfth of the landmass of Libya, which is one of the largest countries on the African continent. This is a sobering finding for Tunisia, which had been largely immune from the kinds of terrorist attacks that have recently plagued Libya and other North African countries. While the museum attack in Tunisia and the hotel attack in Libya may help terrorist groups to achieve their strategic goals, more often than not, armed assaults by terrorists against so-called soft targets such as hotels, supermarkets and malls do not achieve much beyond the tactical successes of global news coverage and causing mayhem. In September 2013, Al-Shabaab, the Somali al Qaeda affiliate, killed 67 people in a fedayeen-style armed assault on the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya. Four gunmen carried out the attack, which unspooled over a four-day period. The Westgate attack received much global news coverage and was designed to put pressure on the Kenyan government, which had sent troops to Somalia to fight Al-Shabaab. However, a year and a half after the attack on the mall, Al-Shabaab continues to lose territory in Somalia, and the Kenyan military has continued to battle the terrorist group. The plague of Mumbai-style armed assaults by jihadist terrorists is not confined to Africa. In January, Mumbai-style tactics were used in Paris when Cherif and Said Kouachi and Amedy Coulibaly conducted armed assaults on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket over a three-day period. All three gunmen were killed. In a videotape, Coulibaly said ISIS inspired him. The Paris attacks received considerable coverage around the world but had no impact on France's willingness to continue its involvement in coalition airstrikes against ISIS.", "reference": "Tunisia weathered the Arab Spring and has been buoyed by its tourism industry .\nAuthors: The fedayeen-style attacks are an effort to spread fear and weaken the nation ."}, "280": {"id": "696125a6b1b9fd6fb72d6c533d3061b588dcd15a", "article": "Cheat:\u00a0Melissa Whiting, 33, from Darlington, who used illegally claimed benefits as a 'financial security net' while enjoying foreign holidays and a lavish lifestyle . A mother-of-three who used illegally-claimed benefits as a 'financial safety net' while enjoying foreign holidays and lavish spending on her home was receiving thousands from her well-paid boyfriend, a court heard. Melissa Whiting told officials she lived alone with her three children and raked in income support, housing benefit and council tax relief, a court heard.

Home to 12,000 people, Sedona is one of the most left-leaning communities in the United States set among 19 square miles of striking red rocks that resemble a Martian landscape. A 90 minute drive or 100 mile journey away from Phoenix, the twon itself sits 4,500 feet above sea level, with a mixture of mountain and desert climates. Many of the residents of Sedona are artistic, spiritual types and the local economy is based around the jaw dropping scenery and nearby Native American ruins. Reason for siking life: Kollbek (with his girlfriend) says he attempted the terrifying stunt because he happened to be the area of Arizona . Thrill-seeker: After the stunt, the cyclist said: 'I live for thrills like this, and I would have tackled this line whether it was filmed or not' Home to 12,000 people, Sedona is one of the most left-leaning communities in the United States set among 19 square miles of striking red rocks that resemble a Martian landscape .", "reference": "Michal Kollbek takes off-road cycling to new limits as he rides\u00a0bike across famed White Line in Sedona, Arizona .\nThe 30-year-old Polish daredevil was captured riding across an almost-vertical cliff with a terrifying drop below .\nThe stunning video was filmed at Red Rock State Park and was shot from a drone flying overhead ."}, "284": {"id": "feb60caa507edf5bf8a559a9c7bb491e7663ad3d", "article": "This was a walkover, a day Reading undermined the race for Premier League promotion in a bid to reach Wembley. Steve Clarke's decision to make nine changes is surely down to the ridiculous scheduling of Monday\u2019s FA Cup quarter-final replay against Bradford, but some of his Championship counterparts might not be impressed. Young Reading were picked off by Watford. That\u2019s not the fault of Clarke, the blame lying squarely with wretched broadcasting rules which deem domestic cup games cannot be played on the same night as Champions League fixtures. Almen Abdi (centre) got Watford off to a dream start against Reading by scoring  inside a minute . Watford striker Troy Deeney celebrates Abdi's strike as the Hornets set the tone for the match early on . Watford (4-3-1-2): Gomes 6.5; Motta 7.5, Ekstrand 7, Cathcart 6.5, Pudil 7; Watson 8, Guedioura 7 (Layun 58, 6), Tozser 6; Abdi 7 (Forestieri 7, 8.5); Vydra 8 (Angella 83), Deeney 7.5 . Subs not used:\u00a0Bond, Doyley, Paredes, Anya . Goals: Abdi 1, Vydra 39, Deeney 48,\u00a0Forestieri 85 .

But other managers, particularly Mark Warburton and Steve McClaren - whose sides both dropped points - may talk of a duty of care to the league, even if Reading can do nothing but finish mid-table themselves. The average squad number of the visitors here was 26, a statistic to tell all. Clarke is set to name a completely fresh XI tomorrow night and was understandably prickly when asked about the changes. \u2018What ramifications? I can\u2019t think for the life of me why there would be any ramifications - I\u2019m not concerned whatsoever,\u2019 he said. I\u2019m allowed to pick from my squad, so I\u2019ll pick from my squad. I don\u2019t understand.\u2019 Fifty-two seconds is all it took the hosts, Troy Deeney popping a neat ball into Almen Abdi, who stroked beyond Mikkel Anderson with the outside of his boot. Marco Motta\u2019s stunning 30-yard half-volley cannoned off the bar six minutes later. Anderson then made an acrobatic save from early substitute Fernando Forestieri\u2019s overhead kick, and this was put beyond doubt when Matej Vydra slipped his man and lifted into the net with ease before half-time. Prior to the match Watford players show their support for fan Nick Cruwys who was attacked last weekend . Matej Vydra doubled Watford's lead shortly before half-time with a right-footed effort . Vyrdra (right) watches on as his shot goes past Reading goalkeeper\u00a0Mikkel Andersen on 39 minutes .

United were 2-0 winners over Arsenal in 2011, the last FA Cup meeting between the sides since the 2005 final in Cardiff's Millennium Stadium, when the match finished 0-0 but the Gunners won after a penalty shoot-out. Rooney says he was inspired by Everton's FA Cup winners in 1995, after they beat United . Rooney scored in that shoot-out, as did Robin van Persie - for Arsenal. Van Persie and Juan Mata are the only members of the United squad to have FA Cup winners' medals, but both came with other clubs. Rooney, who has nine major honours with United, was also on the losing side in 2007 when Didier Drogba's goal in extra-time earned Chelsea a 1-0 triumph at the new Wembley Stadium.

And, to add insult to injury, the Deputy Prime Minister's swift exit appeared to be for the sole purpose of trying his hand at a spot of Am-dram in Gravesend.

At one point, Mr Clegg opted for an outfit swap, changing into a camel-coloured jacket, which he matched with a more severe facial expression, as he walked solo along the high street.

At Westminster, \u00a0he took the lead in The Changeling, opposite Hollywood actress in-the-making Helena Bonham Carter.

But a report hints that the South Korean firm is already working on its next-level displays for a fully foldable smartphone. Unlike the curved models available now, such as the S6 Edge and LG\u2019s Flex 2, Samsung's Galaxy S7 could be flexible and bendy. A report hints that a fully foldable smartphone by Samsung could be ready as soon as next year. This image shows prototype curved screens unveiled last year . A spokesman for Samsung Display told Business Korea: \u2018The industry believes that the commercialisation of foldable smartphones will be possible in 2016.\u2019 A number of the curved screens, including those created by LG and Samsung, use high molecular substance-based polyimide film. This forms the backplane of the flexible panel and is used as an alternative to plastic. The material makes it possible to achieve the maximum curvature radius, which in Semiconductor Energy Laboratroy's display is 0.7-inches (2mm). Polyimide film also helped reduce the thickness of the panel to significantly improve its flexibility. However, until other components such as batteries and processors are made to be flexible too, the dream of a roll-up smartphone will remain on the horizon. It is not only smartphones set to get the flexible treatment, as bendy displays could have many uses, such as in smartbands and laptops, for example. A spokesman from the industry said: \u2018When flexible display technology is being used in e-books and laptops, which are substituted for publications, the concept of tiny portable PCs and e-books will be realised in reality.\u2019 Rumours that Samsung was working on a bendable and virtually unbreakable version of its Galaxy handset first surfaced in 2012. The false rumour said that the handset, codenamed 'Project J' could be released in April 2013. Last year, LG demonstrated a 5.9-inch display that can be bent more than 100,000 times without being damaged, at an exhibition in Tokyo. It is not only smartphones set to get the flexible treatment, as bendy displays could have many uses, such as in smartbands (illustrated) and laptops, for example . The foldable display is made of layers of lights using organic light emitting diodes (OLED). It features touch sensors, meaning it works as a touchscreen at all angles and curvatures, and was demonstrated at the Display Innovation exhibition in Yokohama. In July, LG unveiled an 18-inch screen that can be rolled up and it hopes to expand the technology to work with 60-inch displays in the future. Earlier this month, Samsung revealed its next generation of Galaxy phones, including the Galaxy S6 Edge, which features a curved 5.1 inch display. On the S6 Edge, notifications appear on either the right or left-hand side, depending on which hand the owner uses. Up to five contacts can be programmed to appear on this edge, and each contact is assigned a colour. Earlier this month, Samsung revealed its next generation of Galaxy phones, including the Galaxy S6 Edge (pictured), which features a curved 5.1 inch display . To access a contact, users swipe the relevant colour and this reveals recent interactions and details about that person. Conversely, swiping the long edge of the screen shows the time, weather or other customised notifications. And when the phone is placed face down, the edge glows to show a phone call, text or email has been received. If these messages are from a saved contact, the edge will glow the relevant colour. Plus the curved screen increases the viewing width and height of videos and photos to make them appear 3D. Both the 6 Edge and the Galaxy 6 have metal cases and are the first to feature dual-standard wireless charging technology built inside the handsets. People will need to pay extra for a Samsung non-slip wireless charger, but because it supports other standards both phones will work with any compatible charging dock. This image also shows the curvature of the phone's screen . David Kang, vice president of online at Samsung Mobile, told MailOnline: 'We've created not only what's next for the industry but set a new standard for smartphones.'

The Australian Red Cross said via Twitter that \"humanitarian needs will be enormous. Many people have lost their homes. Shelter, food and water (are) urgent priorities\" in Port Vila. Meteorologists said the storm has weakened some, but it was still pounding the islands after hours of fierce winds and torrential rain. \"#CyclonePam still tearing through #Vanuatu. 'Much bigger than expected,' says our colleague in Port Vila. Initial reports of devastation,\" the Australian branch of UNICEF said on Twitter earlier. Pam, one of the strongest storms seen in the South Pacific in years, earlier made a direct hit on the capital, raising fears of mass destruction. In its 8 a.m. Saturday update, the Vanuatu Meteorological Services warned of \"very destructive hurricane force winds\" of 155 mph (250 kilometers per hour) in Shefa and Tafea provinces, with several others facing \"very rough to phenomenal seas with heavy swells.\" The Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, said the cyclone had weakened from the equivalent of a Category 5 hurricane to a Category 4. It has dumped more than 9 inches of rain on the capital in a 36-hour period and has wind gusts of up to 190 mph (305 kph). Track the storm . Pam is forecast to move southeastward along the western edge of the southern islands of Vanuatu. It isn't expected to make any additional landfalls before dissipating. It will continue to weaken as it crosses cooler waters and encounters higher wind shear. Pam is expected to pass east of New Zealand on Sunday and into Monday. It could bring heavy rainfall to North Island, including Auckland. The capital, the biggest city in the Vanuatu island chain, sits on the coastline, which is vulnerable to storm surges during powerful cyclones. Tropical Cyclone Pam is the strongest storm to make landfall since the devastating Super Typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines in 2013. Chloe Morrison, an emergency communications director for the humanitarian organization World Vision, told CNN that she could see some light between her boarded-up windows but it was still hard to see the totality of the destruction outside the house where she and seven others huddled in a back room during the storm. \"Seven hours hunkered down and it's still not safe to go outside,\" she said. \"The winds are still really howling. We're really lucky to be in a concrete house.\" Part of the tin roof twisted off the house and landed by one of the windows, she said. She also noted that two trees outside didn't get uprooted, but they had not one bit of fruit or any leaves remaining. Despite the \"quite terrifying ordeal,\" Morrison said, their house didn't have any damage. Through the night, the wind and torrential rain made it sound like an angry ocean was just outside their doors, she said. World Vision, which says it's been based in Vanuatu for more than 30 years, said its emergency assessment  team would head out to view the damage when it is safe. The staff helped prepare communities on the islands for the cyclone by positioning water, food, blankets, tarpaulins, and shelter, hygiene and kitchen kits in key places, it said, as well as advising on disaster preparedness. Residents have been advised to seek shelter in places such as churches, universities and schools. \"The strongest thing they've got is cement churches,\" said Inga Mepham, program director for CARE International for the Vanuatu program. \"Some of them don't have that. It's hard to find a structure that you'd think would be able to withstand a Category 5 (storm).\" Earlier, photographer Michael McLennan -- who said the storm is being called the \"Vanuatu Monster\" -- told CNN that the \"strength of winds is incredible.\" Video footage he shot earlier Friday showed palm trees being whipped by wind and rain. Evacuation alerts have been issued for several parts of the country. Even before the sun rose Saturday, Vanuatu was already getting hit hard, with most communication and power cut off due to the storm. \"The wind outside is terrifying,\" Michael Wolfe, World Vision's national director in Vanuatu, told that organization. \"I can't imagine what it's like for families out there who weren't able to find safe shelter before the storm.\" The archipelago nation northeast of Australia contains 83 small islands, many of which have little infrastructure and lack the strong housing structures that can endure a walloping storm. Because of the tropical climate in Vanuatu, some of the housing is made of lighter building materials, including straw and corrugated metals. Residents prepared for the storm, boarding up windows and chopping down trees that stand close to buildings in case they could become debris or cause further damage or injury. CNN host Bill Weir, who was recently in Vanuatu on assignment, said that while Port Vila has some modern development in the form of an airport, large hotels and a convention center that's under construction, life on some of the islands has remained almost unchanged for thousands of years. \"For search and rescue, for bringing food and supplies and medicine, it's extremely challenging,\" he said. Pam has triggered watches and warnings in the Solomon Islands and New Zealand.

Ministers were last night struggling to contain a spiralling row about highly contentious plans to bar 430,000 civil servants from talking to journalists. Critics raised concerns about a quiet change to the civil service code, which they warned could \u2018stifle whistleblowing\u2019 and open government. The code has been amended to include a new provision making clear that officials could be sacked if they speak out before checking with a minister. Downing Street was understood to have intervened in the row, forcing the Cabinet Office to offer a series of concessions. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude agreed to redraft guidance to \u2018strengthen protection\u2019 for those speaking out to blow the whistle on scandals or abuses of public money, and include a commitment to being \u2018as open as possible\u2019 with Parliament and the public. However, that is unlikely to appease critics, who have asked why such a change has been enforced just before the general election campaign. It appears to have been agreed by Sir Jeremy Heywood, the Cabinet Secretary, who has been nicknamed Sir Cover-Up for preventing the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq War from seeing letters and records of phone calls between Tony Blair and George Bush. However, the impetus is understood to have come from ministers, who wanted to control the flow of information from departments to make clear that they, not civil servants, are ultimately in charge. A line has been added to the civil service code, which governs officials\u2019 conduct, saying: \u2018Ensure you have ministerial authorisation for any contact with the media.\u2019 Margaret Hodge, who chairs the Commons public accounts committee, said the Cabinet Office was \u2018using a sledgehammer to crack a nut\u2019. Margaret Hodge (pictured) said the Cabinet Office was \u2018using a sledgehammer to crack a nut\u2019 \u2018You don\u2019t want to encourage briefing against ministers, or criticising people behind their backs,\u2019 she said. \u2018But the more openness, the more understanding people have of the way government works, the better.\u2019 Tory MP Charlotte Leslie, who has championed more openness in the health service, said it could stifle whistleblowing. \u2018It makes sense that the Government wants to get its work done without a running commentary from inside the system, but I would like them to set out what they have in place to help people whistleblowing,\u2019 she said. Ministers point that out civil servants can blow the whistle on a major scandal using legal protections afforded to them in the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1988. But Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union that represents civil servants, said it was absurd to enforce a \u2018blanket ban\u2019 on all 430,000 civil servants having unauthorised contacts with journalists. Mr Penman: \u2018Civil servants will become worried about every contact they have with the media, and will be looking over their shoulder all the time when talking to the public \u2013 as that\u2019s who they are talking to through the media \u2013 about the service they deliver.\u2019 The Cabinet Office insist that the amendment will not affect contacts between journalists and press officers or advisers who regularly speak to the media. They insist it simply \u2018clarifies\u2019 current practice. Mr Maude last night: \u2018The Cabinet Secretary and I are both clear that no one should be exposed to personal and professional risk for doing what is in the public interest. \u2018The amendments make no change to the rights of individuals under whistleblowing legislation or our drive to increase Government transparency and openness.

Welbeck joined the Gunners on transfer deadline day from Manchester United, where he had become frustrated at a lack of opportunities in his preferred central striker role. Since the return to fitness and form of Olivier Giroud, who spent four months out with a broken leg, the 24-year-old has found himself deployed on the flank of a front three along with Alexis Sanchez, rather than down the middle. Danny Welbeck joined Arsenal from Manchester United last summer after growing frustrated at bit-part role . The striker was left on the bench for Wednesday's Premier League match against QPR . Welbeck was a late substitute for both of the previous two Barclays Premier League matches, but could face his former club in Monday night's FA Cup quarter-final at Old Trafford. Wenger is convinced Welbeck, who has seven Arsenal goals, can play a big part in the future of the team, but like everyone else has to earn their place in the starting XI. 'Danny Welbeck puts big team effort in, he plays very well for me and is an exceptional player who will have a great future here,' said Wenger, who confirmed centre-back Gabriel Paulista was set for 'two to three weeks' out with a hamstring injury suffered in the midweek Barclays Premier League win over QPR at Loftus Road. 'The subject is raised because he is a former Man United player, (but) I am very, very happy that I bought him.' Wenger continued: 'Welbeck is very important and has played many, many games since the start of the season. The England international was also absent from the starting line-up against Everton last Sunday . Arsene Wenger says Welbeck has a bright future at Arsenal but faces a lot of competition . 'His position is one of the three up front, central, left or right. He can play anywhere.' England forward Theo Walcott is another who has watched on from the bench in recent weeks, as Wenger finally enjoys the luxury of strength in depth. The Arsenal boss added: 'We have a lot of competition going on in the team, especially up front - we have plenty of offensive potential. It makes every decision more difficult. 'People always raise these kind of questions when (either) you do not have enough players, or when you do have enough players. '(However), we have chosen a job where competition is part of our job. That means we can't complain about that, because we have made that choice. 'Our job is to serve the club and to compete with other people to do as well as we can to serve the club. The 24-year-old could return to the side for Monday night's FA Cup clash against former side United . Wenger confirmed he will be without defender Gabriel for up to three weeks due to a hamstring injury . 'The only important thing is what the club achieves - all of us are only here for that.' Arsenal have a poor record at Old Trafford, not winning since September 2006 and suffering an 8-2 thumping there in August 2011. Wenger, though, sees no reason why the Gunners, who are ahead of United in the Premier League table, should not be able to produce the required performance this time around. 'I don't believe too much in history, I just believe in the performance on the day,' he said. 'At the moment we are doing very well away from home. The size of the pitch is exactly the same everywhere, it is just down to how much we turn up and how much effort we put in to win the game. 'Both teams will think if we get over this hurdle, we have a good opportunity to win the competition. Wenger was forced to defend Mesut Ozil after criticism from former United midfielder Paul Scholes . 'We are confident from our Premier League run, so we go to Manchester United to qualify and to give absolutely everything.' Wenger, meanwhile, rejected criticism of Mesut Ozil by former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes, who claimed the German playmaker was only 'going through the motions' at Arsenal. 'I think a player like Paul Scholes would have loved to play with Mesut Ozil,' Wenger said. 'We are all in a job where in every single game we have to prove a point. 'I believe Ozil has the quality, he puts a lot of effort in to help the team and he works much harder than his style shows. 'You can be cheated a little bit by his style of play, because he is fluent, easy, subtle and he does not look like he puts the effort in, but he does.'", "reference": "Danny Welbeck joined Arsenal from Manchester United last summer .\nStriker has had to make do with substitute appearances in recent games .\nArsene Wenger insists the England forward has a bright future at the club .\nArsenal have a lot of competition particularly in the forward area ."}, "297": {"id": "fee11e7dfdad8d1f8bfefacb6fdf353420b174ad", "article": "The two men charged with allegedly planning to carry out a brutal terrorist attack in Sydney will plead not guilty.

'The unfortunate result is that it will also bring unfair prejudice to the matters before the court and also undermine the court process.' The case will return to court in May. When the men were first in court, Commonwealth DPP prosecutor Kay Marenos said the brief of evidence against the men was four pages long 'but that is likely to change' and included photographs and a short video. Facebook pictures of  Kiad, who immigrated to Australia from Kuwait in 2009, revealed his fashion interest and showed him sporting expensive watches and suits as well as making some strange fashion statements . A keen weight-lifter, the 25-year-old removalist also shared selfies of himself at the gym . Mr Kiad entered Australia in 2012, where he had worked as a nurse - but when he arrived in Australia he found he could not transfer his skills. He was granted a visa under the family and spousal visa arrangements and recently took up a job as a removalist but was fired and was on the dole at the time of his arrest, it has been reported. Attorney-General George Brandis told parliament on Wednesday: 'Significantly, police also located a video recording of one suspect kneeling in front of an ISIL (IS) flag, with the knife and machete, making a politically-motivated statement, threatening to undertake violent acts with those weapons.' A Sydney police station and officers on the street were revealed to have been the the targets with attacks scheduled for just before midnight on Tuesday, Channel Nine reported. In contrast to the snaps of him in shiny  pants, other pictures show him wearing traditional white Islamic clothing and headpieces . Mr Al-Kutobi was granted citizenship in 2013 and was studying to be a nurse while Mr Kiad, originally from Kuwait where he immigrated from in 2009, was reported to have been recently fired from his removalist job. While some neighbours told Fairfax that he was 'friendly', 'open minded about religion' and 'never talked about Islam', others admitted he and Mr Al-Katobi had begun acting differently after the anti-terror raids in western Sydney last September. 'He began wearing a scarf, just like ISIS and Mohammad, he grew a long beard,' Neighbour Michael David said of Al-Kutobi. 'I heard them praying in there [the granny flat] and reading the Koran,' said Mr David, who speaks Arabic.

Notel or 'notetel' - the name is a uniquely North Korean - a word combining 'notebook' and 'television' - are easily found onthe black market for around 300 Chinese yuan ($48) 'The North Korean government takes their national ideology . extremely seriously, so the spread of all this media that . competes with their propaganda is a big and growing problem for . them,' said Sokeel Park of Liberty in North Korea (LiNK), an . organisation that works with defectors. 'If Pyongyang fails to successfully adapt to these trends, . they could threaten the long-term survival of the regime . itself.' North Koreans have been spending money more openly, a sign . that some forms of entrepreneurship are increasingly tolerated . and that the state is easing some of its harsh controls over the . economy. In recent months, consumption has become more . conspicuous. 'The variety and number of places for locals to spend money . has really increased,' said one regular visitor to Pyongyang, . declining to be identified. 'People seem a lot more confident . flashing the cash than they used to be. I've seen people spend . $500 on a phone with no hesitation, for example.' There is no sign, however, that the regime in . nuclear-capable North Korea is loosening its grip, looking to . make substantial reforms or making any change in its . unpredictable ways of dealing with the outside world. But along with rising incomes, more goods are available in . the impoverished country, mostly on the black market but also in . some state-controlled stores. Notel or 'notetel' - the name is a uniquely North Korean . word combining 'notebook' and 'television' - are easily found on . the black market for around 300 Chinese yuan ($48), and are . also available in some state shops and markets. The device was legalised last year, according to . defector-run news outlets in Seoul - one of many recent measures . taken by the state to accommodate grassroots change. The new rules, however, also require North Koreans to . register their notel, enabling authorities to monitor who is . most likely to be watching banned foreign media.

The notel comes from China, either smuggled or legally . imported. Lee Seok-young, a defector from the North, said he smuggled . 18,000 Chinese-made notel into the country last year. He said he . ordered them directly from a factory in Guangzhou that was . likely still in production solely to satisfy the demands of the . North Korean market. The devices have lost their popularity in China over the . years, but still sell well in the provinces bordering North . Korea, according to data on the China-based online shopping . website Taobao. When asked to quote a wholesale price for notel, one Chinese . trader in the border city of Yanji said: 'You want to send them . to North Korea? How many do you want to send? They sell well . there.' Lee Seok-young, a defector from the North, said he smuggled18,000 Chinese-made notel into the country last year. The low-voltage notel differs from the portable DVD players . of the late 1990s in that they have USB and SD card ports, and a . built-in TV and radio tuner. They can also be charged with a car . battery - an essential piece of household equipment in . electricity-scarce North Korea. Legally-registered notel must be fixed to official state . television and radio channels, according to the Daily NK, a . Seoul-based news organisation run by defectors. Lee, the defector, said the device's multi-function nature . makes it easier for users to get away with watching illegal . material. 'To avoid getting caught, people load a North Korean DVD . while watching South Korean dramas on a USB stick, which can be . pulled out,' he said. 'They then tell the authorities, who feel . the heat from the notel to check whether or not it has been . recently used, that they were watching North Korean films'. Park at the LiNK organisation added: 'They are small enough . to roll up in a blanket and hide in a wardrobe. They have become . so popular because they are perfect for overcoming the twin . barriers to foreign media consumption: surveillance and power . outages.

Strict rules released by broadcaster ITV for Thursday's night's event spell out in minute detail who will speak when, and for how long, with host Julie Etchingham trying to keep order. Scroll down for video . From left to right the line up will be: Natalie Bennett (Green), Nick Clegg (Lib Dem), Nigel Farage (Ukip), Ed Miliband (Labour), Leanne Wood (Plaid Cymru), Nicola Sturgeon (SNP) and David Cameron (Conservative). Lots have been drawn to decide the order in which each leader will speak, including the opening and closing statements and giving one-minute answers to the four studio audience questions . Lots have been drawn to agree where each of the leaders will stand and when they get to speak. The agreed line up behind the podiums will be, from left to right: Natalie Bennett (Green), Nick Clegg (Lib Dem), Nigel Farage (Ukip), Ed Miliband (Labour), Leanne Wood (Plaid Cymru), Nicola Sturgeon (SNP) and David Cameron (Conservative). Names drawn out of a hat also helped to decide who will get to speak first, with Ms Bennett opening proceedings and Mr Cameron having the final word by giving the last closing remarks. The two-hour live debate will be be screened from 8pm to 10pm on Thursday night. Each leader will give an opening statement to a studio audience of around 200 people. They will then be allowed to deliver an uninterrupted one-minute answer to each question, before 18 minutes of debate on each question. There will be just four 'substantial election questions' covered during the night. Each leader will then give a closing statement to the cameras, before the programme ends at 10pm. ITV newsreader Julie Etchingham will be keeping keep order as moderator during the debate on Thursday night . The seven-way debate is a long way from the 2010 contest, when Mr Clegg and Mr Cameron went up against Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown . Mr Cameron will speak last, enabling him to have the last word. He is likely to repeat his refrain that a vote for anything other than a Tory majority will mean 'chaos'. Producers insist that the leaders will not see the questions in advance and an 'experienced editorial panel' will select them. Polling company ICM has chosen the 'politically-balanced' audience, with around 20 per cent said to be undecided voters. During the entire two-hour programme there will be just one advert break, a highly unusual move for Britain's biggest\u00a0commercial broadcaster. The live programme is the only debate involving all of the main leaders scheduled for the campaign, after months of protracted negotiations between broadcasters and the parties. Ukip's Nigel Farage today unveiled an anti-immigration poster in Dover (left) while Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood launched the party's manifesto in Cardiff . Mr Clegg, who emerged as the surprise winner of the 2010 debates, today said he was spending less time preparing for the contest this time. 'I'm not spending nearly as much time trying to think through every twist and turn, I'm not preparing nearly quite as methodically as last time,' he told reporters on his bright yellow battlebus. 'The longer I've been in politics the more I think you can over-think these things. And it will be very different - there'll be seven of us. 'The last time nobody knew who I was, so I had nothing to lose. In a sense this time I dont have much to lose either, as everyone appears to have their mind made up one way or the other. 'I'm not going to triumph in these debates - that's just self-evident. What I learnt about the debates with Farage is you might marshal the best arguments but if there are people who play better to the gallery they are going to do well. 'I've been in politics long enough to know its not a beauty contest and it tends to be the case that newcomers or people not well known to the public tend to do best, so I enter with quite sober realistic expectations. But I intend to enjoy it. In the driving seat: David Cameron today climbed behind the wheel of the 2 millionth Mini Off a production line in Oxford . 'I'm not disillusioned, I think you just have to keep what debates can and cant do in perspective.' Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg boarded his plush battlebus to visit Watford and Cardiff as he continued campaigning . SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, Labour leader Ed Miliband and Green leader Natalie Bennett complete the seven-strong line-up . Mr Farage said he was disappointed to be placed near the middle of the line-up for the debates, rather than near Mr Cameron. Speaking on a visit to the Coastguard pub, close to the White Cliffs of Dover, Mr Farage said: 'I'm disappointed that Mr Cameron is so far away from me but we'll make the best of it.' In the run-up to the 2010 election there were three debates, in which Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg took on Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown. However, other parties including Ukip and the Greens demanded a slot, while Mr Cameron refused to take part in several debates once the campaign got underway. Labour have accused the Tory leader of being 'chicken' for refusing to go up against Mr Miliband. On April 16 the BBC will host a 'challengers debate' with only the leaders of opposition parties including Labour, Ukip, the SNP, the Greens and Plaid Cymru. Then on April 30 there will be a special of BBC's Question Time, with Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg appearing separately to answer questions from a studio audience.

Utah is a capital punishment state and needs a backup execution method in case a shortage of the drugs persists,\u00a0Republican Governor Gary Herbert said. 'We regret anyone ever commits the heinous crime of aggravated murder to merit the death penalty, and we prefer to use our primary method of lethal injection when such a sentence is issued,' the governor's spokesman said. Scroll down for video . The firing squad execution chamber at the Utah State Prison in Draper, Utah in June 2010.\u00a0Utah became the only state to allow firing squads for executions when Governor Gary Herbert signed a law Monday approving the method for use when no lethal injection drugs are available . However, enforcing death sentences is 'the obligation of the executive branch'. The governor's office noted that other states allow execution methods other than lethal injection. In Washington state, inmates can request hanging. In New Hampshire, hangings are fallback if lethal injections can't be given. Ronnie Lee Gardner, pictured above, was the last person killed by firing squad in the U.S. after choosing this method of execution. Gardner, 49, was executed on June 18, 2010, at 12.15am at Utah State Prison in Draper. In 1984, Gardner had killed Melvyn John Otterstrom, shooting him in the face during a robbery in Salt Lake City and leaving his body to be found by his wife. In April 1985, he shot dead attorney Michael Burdell at a court hearing as he tried to escape. He was given a life sentence for the first murder and condemned to die for the second. The firing squad was made up of police officers who had volunteered. One gun was loaded with non-lethal wax bullets so it would not be known who fired the kill shot. And an Oklahoma law would allow the state to use firing squads if lethal injections are ever declared unconstitutional. Utah's new approval of firing squads carries no such legal caveat and represents the latest example of frustration over botched executions and the difficulty of obtaining lethal injection drugs as manufacturers opposed to capital punishment have made them off-limits to prisons. Death by firing squad requires detailed preparations. The prisoner is strapped into a chair at the ankles and by the arms and chest in front of a wood panel with sandbags piled high on either side to prevent the bullets ricocheting. A target is pinned to the prisoner's heart with the intention that shots be fired into the heart rather than the head and the individual will bleed out quickly. The shooters are picked from volunteer police officers. The inmate has two minutes to say any final words before five shooters line up behind a slot in the wall, 25 feet from the chair. The shots are fired from .30 caliber Winchester rifles until the prisoner is declared dead. The bill's sponsor, Republican Rep. Paul Ray of Clearfield, argued that a team of trained marksmen is faster and more decent than the drawn-out deaths involved when lethal injections go awry - or even if they go as planned. Though Utah's next execution is probably a few years away, Ray said wants to settle on a backup method now so authorities are not racing to find a solution if the drug shortage drags on. Ray didn't return messages seeking comment Monday. Opponents of the measure say firing squads are barbaric, with the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah saying the bill makes the state 'look backward and backwoods.' Utah lawmakers stopped offering inmates the choice of firing squad in 2004, saying the method attracted intense media interest and took attention away from victims. The last person executed by firing squad was Ronnie Lee Gardner in 2010. He was executed on the metal chair at the right side of this chamber in Utah State Prison. \u00a0Narrow rifle ports can be seen on the left . Utah is the only state in the past 40 years to carry out such a death sentence, with three executions by firing squad since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. The last was in 2010, when Ronnie Lee Gardner was put to death by five police officers with .30-caliber Winchester rifles in an event that generated international interest and elicited condemnation from many. Gardner killed a bartender and later shot a lawyer to death and wounded a bailiff during a 1985 courthouse escape attempt. The bailiff's widow, VelDean Kirk, who witnessed Gardner's execution, said she supports the new law. 'I don't think it's barbaric,' she said. 'I think that's the best way to do it.' Gardner's brother recently has spoken out against the method. Randy Gardner of Salt Lake City said Monday that he doesn't condone his brother's actions, but he opposes the death penalty and said firing squads make the state look bad. 'My god, we're the only ones that are shooting people in the heart,' he said. One person nearing a possible execution date is Ron Lafferty, the state's longest-serving death row inmate, who claimed God directed him to kill his sister-in-law and her baby daughter in 1984 because of the victim's resistance to his beliefs in polygamy. Lafferty has already requested the firing squad \u2014 an option available to him even before this new law was passed because he, like Gardner, was convicted prior to 2004, when lawmakers stopped offering inmates the choice of firing squad. The other Utah death row inmate who could be next up for execution, Doug Carter, has chosen lethal injection. Under this new law, Carter would get the firing squad if the state can't get their hands on lethal injection drugs 30 days before. The state doesn't currently have lethal injection drugs on hand.

Jaz in the City is playing in Amsterdam come September. EVEN increases the odds of a good night's sleep, while Tune is in harmony with scaled-down budgets. And then there's the vibrant Vib and a new venue, Venu, soon arriving in Dubai. These statements begin to make sense once you realize that they're all the names of modern hotel brands. According to Chekitan S. Dev, a professor at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration, hotels traditionally have been named after an owner or a place. But more recently, he says, \"the naming process has evolved from an off-the-cuff process into something far more systematic.\" So what's behind this influx of idiosyncratic hotel names, replete with misspellings and unexpected word usages? Look to millennials and psychographics -- the study of personality, attitudes, interests and lifestyles. Psychologists say the millennial psychographic is made up of independent-minded, adventurous individuals in search of new experiences. Hospitality brands are crafting their marketing strategies accordingly. \"Hotel companies are lazering in on consumer needs by using psychographic data in a big way,\" says Matthew Von Ertfelda, Marriott's vice president for insight, strategy and innovation. The explosion of social media also has a starring role in the name game. Brands of the 21st century need to have handles that resonate in the global, online world, say the pros. \"Thanks to social media, millennials are the first global generation,\" says Dr. Donna Quadri-Felitti, academic chair of New York University's School of Professional Studies Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism. \"And since this generation is so enamored with texting and tweeting, hotels really have to think how names will play in the new media world.\" For social media purposes, the number of characters in a name counts. Spelling is often sacrificed in the quest for brevity. But another reason for purposeful misspellings may be legal. Spelling is often set into an uncommon form to retain meaning while being trademarkable. \"The odder the name, the less likely someone has already captured it,\" says Cornell professor Dev. \"That's important in terms of intellectual property protection.\" It may explain why Venu and Vib are missing an \"e.\" Venu is a just-announced lifestyle brand, launching its first property in Dubai in 2017. According to parent company Jumeirah Hotels & Resorts, it's designed to give travelers \"the freedom to write their own story, their own narrative, to build their own scene.\" Best Western's new hotel entry, called Vib, is pronounced \"vibe.\" \"We tried to come up with names that celebrated individuality, while also connoting a vibrant spirit,\" says Dick Lew, a partner at Houston-based Acumen Design, a branding firm brought in to hone the name and the image. Hence Vib, which is derived from \"vibrant.\" Color also plays a big part in hotel branding. \"We incorporated a bright persimmon red in the design and the logo, in order to reflect the (Vib) brand's bold personality,\" says Lew. Moxy, the new Marriott partnership with IKEA, is going after \"a sassy, determined, individualistic consumer,\" according to Marriott's Von Ertfelda. The first Moxy opened at Milan's Malpensa Airport in September and more are coming in Europe this year. \"Naming Moxy was a four-month process involving a great deal of brainstorming,\" says Von Ertfelda. \"Once we came up with it, we knew we had a name with emotional resonance that hit a global sweet spot. \"At the same time, though, our lawyers noted the name had to be 'ownable and trademarkable.'\" The change of spelling from moxie to Moxy achieved that. According to Von Ertfelda, senior creative director Maria Rezende-Heiston selected hot pink for the Moxy logo to \"appeal to those who aren't afraid to express themselves\" while using a \"curved font to convey a sense of rhythm, fluidity and independence.\" Color is also key to hotel operator Carlson Rezidor, which is hueing (sic) toward Red and Blu. Blu came about in 2009, after airline SAS withdrew from a partnership with Radisson. After the split, Radisson SAS, a collection of European design hotels, needed a new name. \"We wanted to replace SAS with an equally short name,\" says Rose Anderson, vice president of branding for the Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group. \"We liked using blue from the old SAS logo, because it brought in the heritage of the former brand. \"At the same time, we were looking for a word with positive worldwide connotations ... and blue is the world's favorite color.\" So blue or bleu became Blu, a trademarkable spelling. Carlson Rezidor recently announced a new Red brand that will, according to Anderson, \"build on the Blu concept and further leverage Radisson's brand awareness.\" New brands are also being dubbed with what may seem to be random nouns. But there's nothing random about them. Last year, InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) rolled out EVEN, a new brand cultivated for the growing wellness-minded audience, with two properties in the United States. EVEN expresses the desire for the balance travelers are seeking, says an IHG spokesperson. In its logo, specific colors were chosen to represent elements of nature. The four vertical bars of the logo are off-kilter, while the EVEN letters are composed on a flat horizontal line, representing the brand promise of helping guests stay in balance. Malaysia-based Tune Hotels provides \"five-star beds at a one-star price.\" The group has more than 40 properties worldwide, including five in London. Some in its management group were previously senior executives in the music business. It makes sense, then, that a travel company with a musical name would attempt to strike a global chord. Adding to the medley of avant garde brands, Germany's Steigenberger Hotel Group's Amsterdam hotel Jaz in the City will open in September, with others scheduled to follow. According to Steigenberger Hotel Group, coming Jaz in the City properties will be \"hip and happening hotels\" that \"move to the rhythm of today's curious global traveler\" who has a \"desire to embrace authentic experiences in a city hotel.\" You can't explore the hospitality industry's desire to appeal to the millennial mindset without nodding to W Hotels by Starwood. The brand now seems to have been ahead of its time with hotels that opened in pre-social media 1998. \"Starwood was the first hotel company to look directly at the customer as it evolved a new brand,\" says Paul James, global brand leader of W Hotels Worldwide, St. Regis and The Luxury Collection. W's target customer was a fashionable, high-energy individual -- someone who'd now likely be described as having a millennial psychographic. Starwood defined the brand by adding its \"Whatever, Whenever\" tagline to the simple W logo. Cornell's Dev says Starwood further imbued the brand with meaning by using words like witty, warm and welcoming in its advertising and marketing material. More than 15 years later, the W Hotel brand has more than 70 properties open or in development worldwide. Journalist Laura Powell started covering the travel industry for CNN in the 1980s.

With its fleshy snout, nail-like teeth and flabby pink body it wouldn't look out of place in a science fiction film, but the rare sea goblin shark described as an 'alien of the deep' has been found off Australia's southeast coast and delivered to the Australian Museum in Sydney. The prehistoric-looking goblin sharks live on deep sea bottoms and little is known about their lives. The shark had died by the time it was handed over, but it was still a priceless asset as only four of them have been acquired by the Sydney museum - the first two collected back in the 1980s. A goblin shark with a long flattened snout covered with pores is shown at the Australian Museum . 'It's pretty impressive, it's not hideous it's beautiful,' said the Australian Museum's fish collection manager Mark McGrouther, who described its teeth as looking like 'little daggers'. 'They are not caught terribly often. They are not encountered terribly often at all.' The latest was picked up by a fisherman in January. It was found near Eden, off Australia's southeast coast, at a depth of about 200 metres and delivered in excellent condition to the museum. The Australian Museum's fish collection manager Mark McGrouther shows the jaws of a Goblin Shark in the sorting lab in Sydney . McGrouther said he was 'thrilled' to handle the shark, which is found in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans. The species, whose scientific name is 'Mitsukurina owstoni', is thought to be a living fossil dating back some 125 million years. The animal's jaw mechanism, which shoots forward when it detects prey and then retracts under its fleshy, spade-shaped snout, was what fascinated McGrouther the most. Its fleshy snout, nail-like teeth and flabby pink body makes it stand out from the crowd . 'I suspect because it has got soft, flabby musculature, it doesn't need much energy... so it will swim slowly over the bottom just using its snout like a metal detector,' he said.

Jaseem Emwazi blasted his killer son Mohammed - who was last week revealed as the notorious Islamic State executioner - and said: 'To hell with my son'. In an phone call to a colleague yesterday, Jaseem is said to have broken down in tears and confessed he was 'ashamed' of his son. Scroll down for video . Ashamed: Jaseem Emwazi (left), father of Jihadi John, described his killer son as 'a dog, an animal'. Mohammed Emwazi, is seen right in a 1996 school photograph . Abu Meshaal, 40, who works with Jaseem in a supermarket depot in rural Kuwait, told the Telegraph\u00a0that Mr Emwazi disowned his son when he telephoned his family to tell them he was fleeing to Syria in 2013 and to beg for their forgiveness. Mr Meshaal revealed: 'Mohammed called his father and said 'I'm going to Syria to fight jihad, please release me and forgive me for everything'. Jassem said, 'F*** you. I hope you die before you arrive in Syria'.' Jaseem is said to be too ashamed to return to his job as a storekeeper after his son's identity was revealed last week. He appeared drawn but did not display any signs of emotions when he visited his lawyer in Kuwait today, the BBC reported. His lawyer said he was in a 'state of shock' after being questioned by the Kuwaiti authorities about his son's actions. A second colleague - who spoke anonymously to\u00a0Kuwait's Qabbas newspaper - said: 'All I know is that he was talking about his son whose behaviour he was not able to control. He was so tired and kept on repeating that my son is not a good son.' Other appalled relatives of Emwazi condemned his actions and said they would welcome his death. A Kuwaiti cousin, who would not give his name, said: 'We hate him. We hope he will be killed soon. This will be good news for our family.' Jaseem was a member of the 'Bidoun' group of stateless people denied citizenship by countries in the Gulf. He worked as a police officer in Kuwait until he found his loyalties questioned after Saddam Hussein's 1990-1 invasion of the Gulf State because his family was originally from Iraq. His family was reportedly accused of collaborating with the Iraqi army during the seven-month occupation. Mr Emwazi took his wife and his children to live in London in 1993.He was awarded British nationality in 2002 and returned to Kuwait the next year, the Arab Times reported today. Evil: Mohammed Emwazi (left) was last week unmasked as Jihadi John (right), the killer who carried out a series of beheadings of Western hostages in violent videos . It is not known when he settled in his native country, and he is thought to have regularly travelled back and forth between the UK and Kuwait. Local sources say he has been living and working in Kuwait for at least two years. MailOnline today visited a house in the dusty Kuwaiti suburb of Al-Ayoun said to be linked to the Emwazis. But a Kuwaiti woman who answered the door said she had never heard of the family and insisted she had lived there for many years. Meanwhile, it was also revealed today that Jihadi John is understood to have taken a bride in Syria after becoming Islamic State's most feared executioner. A family friend said the masked butcher is believed to have married since joining the terror group in 2013. It is unclear whether the British intelligence services are aware who his bride is. But once she is identified, security chiefs will be desperate to investigate her and her family's background for clues that could help them locate the feared terrorist. Married: A recent film is believed to show Emwazi shortly after he arrived in Syria in 2013. It is now understood he married whilst in the war-torn country . Emwazi, from Queen's Park, north-west London, was born in Kuwait in 1988 but moved to Britain with his parents and younger siblings in 1993 after the Gulf War. He went to school and university in the UK before returning to Kuwait to work in 2009. While living in the Gulf State, he became engaged to a local woman and found a job as a salesman for a computer software company. Emwazi was banned from re-entering Kuwait in May 2010 after the British authorities raised concerns about his links to extremism. He claimed this cost him his job and his fianc\u00e9e in the Gulf State. A family friend said Emwazi was thought to have married after joining IS in Syria. 'I heard from a few friends that he had gone to fight, and when I asked a family member about it, she said, 'Oh he's moved to Syria to work and has gotten married',' he told The Times. Killer: A man thought to be Jihadi John proclaims allegiance to a terror group in footage filmed in 2013. The video is thought to be the first known appearance by the executioner now unmasked as Mohammed Emwazi . A video emerged this week which is believed to show Emwazi ranting on camera shortly after he arrived in Syria from the UK. The footage is of two bands of fanatical fighters joining forces in 2013 under the command of notorious terrorist Omar al-Shishani. At the front stands a man thought to be Emwazi - the west Londoner last week unmasked as the killer of Western hostages in a series of videos which have shocked the world. New tapes also revealed today that the killer told MI5 he was a 'moderate Muslim' as he desperately tried explain why he had been picked up in terror-plagued east Africa. Cage, the campaign group criticised for blaming the ISIS killer's actions on Britain, released a recording of a 2009 interview they carried out with Emwazi. Home: The Emwazi family have left their house in north London and are believed to have been living in Kuwait for the last two years . In the recording, Emwazi tells how he was questioned by British security services after he was flown home from Tanzania suspected of trying to join Somali terror group al-Shabaab. The ISIS killer complained that he was being 'threatened' by MI5 and moaned that agents were 'putting words in his mouth'. But just three years after claiming he harboured no extremist tendencies, Emwazi appeared in Syria beheading Western hostages in violent Islamic State videos.", "reference": "Ashamed father of Mohammed Emwazi disowns son in emotional outburst .\nJaseem Emwazi had row with the killer over his decision to go 'for jihad'\nFamily members say: 'We hate him.

Monk and new Aston Villa boss Sherwood got to know each other on the same Football Association of Wales Pro-Licence coaching course but the practical takes precedence over the theory on Saturday with three Barclays Premier League points at stake. Sherwood got his break in management at Tottenham first - a position he was unlucky to lose according to Monk - and the former England midfielder has revived Villa's fortunes with three successive wins taking them away from the Premier League danger zone and into the semi-final of the FA Cup. Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood is preparing for the visit of former coaching coursemate Garry Monk . Sherwood has enjoyed a great start to life since taking over the Villa Park managerial hot-seat . 'He's gone in there and lifted the confidence in the group,' Monk said at his pre-match press conference. 'You need results to do that but they've got very good players there who obviously weren't playing to their full potential before Tim took over. 'But he's had an instant impact. He's a very honest guy, black and white, and that comes across in his interviews and the way he approaches the game. Garry Monk believes himself and Sherwood are very much their own men despite their similarities . 'They're fighting for their lives and we know this game is vitally important to them but it is the same for us. 'We've got our own agenda, we want to achieve our best total of 47 points, and I think you've seen our attitude and focus in our recent games against Tottenham and Liverpool. 'The actual performances deserved more than they got and we need to make sure we replicate that to get the points at Villa.' The pair have both been labelled with the tag of bright, young British managers, even if the 46-year-old Sherwood is actually 10 years older than Monk who celebrated his first anniversary as Swansea boss last month. Swansea manager Monk observes his players during the training session at the Fairwood Training Centre . But Monk says while certain similarities exist between them they are very much their own men with notable differences. 'When Tim came in at Spurs he was already within the club at that time, albeit within a different coaching role,' Monk said. 'I came from a playing background into it and I wouldn't say we were similar managers with the same approach or anything like that. 'But we've got the same desire, commitment and principles and are clear in what we want. 'I'm on the same coaching course as Tim and his views on football are very interesting. Monk believes the former Tottenham Hotspur boss will certainly take Aston Villa forward in the future . 'He's had a fantastic start and I am sure he will take Aston Villa forward after being unlucky at Tottenham. 'He has been given his chance and taken the opportunity really well, he has got them going.' Swansea are seeking to recover from back-to-back league defeats and will come across a former favourite at Villa Park in the shape of Scott Sinclair. The 25-year-old's career nose-dived after his \u00a36.2million move from Swansea to Manchester City in August 2012, Sinclair starting only two league games at the Etihad Stadium before joining Villa on loan in January. Scott Sinclair will come up against his former Swansea teammates during the game at Villa Park . But Sinclair has thrived under Sherwood with three goals in five games and Monk admits it is satisfying to see his former teammate doing well after such a difficult time in his career. 'Scotty has been searching for regular football and it is good to see him playing,' Monk said. 'He did tremendously well for us and we will never forget what he did here. 'It is no surprise to see him playing regular football in the Premier League because he's got the talent to do that.' Sinclair has thrived since arriving at Aston Villa following an unproductive spell with Manchester City .", "reference": "Swansea manager Garry Monk believes Tim Sherwood has a big future .\nDuo met doing the same FA of Wales Pro-Licence coaching course .\nOn Sunday the course friends do battle with each other at Villa Park .\nMonk admits both are very much their own men despite their similarities ."}, "316": {"id": "27d234304aeed42f1c8f9af7e3c417a8a14095d3", "article": "The Conservatives have gained their most substantial poll lead since 2010 in the wake of the Budget, according to one poll.

Just as Chancellor George Osborne ratcheted up company car tax for thousands of motorists, German giant BMW unveiled its new 'budget buster' \u2014 its first mainstream plug-in petrol-electric hybrid SUV. The 'green' BMW X5 xDrive40e  can be recharged at home, can run on electric power only and switches constantly between petrol and electric power while on the move. It'll help keep company car tax far lower than for a conventionally fuelled version. The two-litre petrol engine and the 113bhp electric drive together generate 313bhp of pulling power. The new 'green' BMW X5 xDrive40e (pictured) can be charged at home, can run on electric power only and switches constantly between petrol and electric power while on the move . It has a top speed of 131 mph, will sprint to 62mph in 6.8 seconds and will be launched at next month's New York Motor Show. Average fuel consumption of up to 85 mpg and CO2 emissions \u2014 on which company car tax and road tax are based \u2014 are a low 77g/km. BMW says: 'Short, everyday journeys in urban areas can easily be completed with zero exhaust emissions, while actual fuel consumption is reduced substantially when driving for distances of up to approximately 15 miles in urban traffic. 'Driving in this way equates to an equivalent 94.2mpg.' However, the Budget measures also mean most company car drivers will be thousands of pounds worse off. There will be a 3 percentage point hike in the tax in 2019-20. It means a higherrate taxpayer with a \u00a328,000 Nissan Qashqai 1.6-litre company car will be \u00a31,008 worse off after just five years with a total annual benefit-in-kind tax bill of \u00a33,360. City accountant Deloitte says the hikes are unfair on company car drivers locked into three or four-year deals who 'in good faith' chose a frugal model, only to find it re-classified just a couple of years later as 'a gas-guzzler', and taxed accordingly.

The presenters behind Discovery Channel TV show Wheeler Deelers have picked out their top five restorations in a new manual (pictured) So if you can't face the reality, why not present your other half with a new book about the subject to keep them distracted? The presenters behind the Discovery Channel's hit TV show Wheeler Dealers, Mike Brewer and Edd China, have picked their top five restorations. It marks the release of the new Wheeler Dealers Car Restoration Manual (pictured below \u2014 Haynes, \u00a322.99) and the new series starting on Monday. The manual goes behind the scenes to reflect on ten of the most popular restorations from the first 12 years of the show. The cars featured are: Austin Mini, Jaguar E-Type, Lamborghini Urraco S, Land Rover Discovery, Mazda MX-5, Peugeot 205 GTi, Porsche 911 Targa, Subaru Impreza WR X, Amphicar, and the Willys MB Jeep. Of the Mini restoration, Mike Brewer says: 'The Mini is definitely one of my all-time favourite classics, and is just such good fun to drive. If you want a small classic that'll be easy to work on, this is the car for you; and there's a great owners' scene, so you'll never be stuck for help or advice.' ? Cars made here are becoming even more British as the amount of parts deployed that are made in the UK has risen by a fifth. Domestic parts makers sold 19 per cent more components to UK-based manufacturers last year than in 2013, say new figures from the Automotive Council. But the 'Britishness' of cars manufactured here is still far less than 40 years ago. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) says around a third of the components in a UK-built car are sourced domestically, compared to more than 90 per cent in the mid-Seventies. Think of Jeep and you think of America. But maybe not for much longer. For the new Jeep Renegade scores a few considerable firsts, not least being built in Italy. Jeep's debut in the small SUV market features a nine-speed gearbox, along with a 7in full-colour multi-view display. It is also the first car from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to be jointly developed by Italian and American engineers. The new Jeep Renegade was built in Italy and features a nine-speed gearbox, along with a 7in full-colour multi-view display . As such it is also the first Jeep to be built in Europe, but sold in the U.S. It also features a 'My Sky' sunroof that gives occupants a true open-air driving experience. Jeep, now along with Chrysler owned by Fiat, says that although built in Italy, the Renegade had to be instantly recognisable as a Jeep. It'll be sold in 100 markets globally. Designers were challenged to come up with a look that would symbolise Jeep's U.S. heritage while appealing to youthful, adventurous buyers. The result is rugged yet chic, and preserves classic styling cues such as the seven-slot grille, round headlamps and straight-line wheel arches.

Tony winner and Broadway icon Harvey Fierstein will contribute new material to the original book by William F. Brown and work alongside Zadan, Meron and Leon. Leon won a 2014 Tony Award for directing \"A Raisin in the Sun,\" and earned a nomination for \"Fences.\" Fierstein, as a writer, won Tonys for \"La Cage Aux Folles\" and \"Torch Song Trilogy.\" He's also written books for musical hits including \"Kinky Boots\" and \"Newsies.\" As an actor, he's won Tonys for best actor in a musical (\"Hairspray\") and best actor in a play (\"Torch Song\"). \"We love this yearly tradition and we're more excited than ever to not only bring another Broadway musical to America's living rooms, but also see it land on Broadway as well,\" NBC Entertainment chairman Bob Greenblatt said. \"It's a natural next step for our live musical events, and we're so pleased to be in business with this award-winning creative team and Scott Zeiger, president and managing director of Cirque du Soleil's new theatrical division.

Zadan and Meron will reunite with Leon, with whom they worked on \"Steel Magnolias\" and \"A Raisin in the Sun.\" Universal Television will produce.

TV ratings: 'Peter Pan Live!' falls from 'Sound of Music' \"The Wiz\" is a retelling of \"Oz\" in an African-American/multicultural context. It was adapted as a film in 1978 starring Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Lena Horne and Richard Pryor. It centers on Dorothy, a young woman from Kansas, who is swept up in a tornado and relocated to a fantasy world inhabited by munchkins, good and bad witches, and flying monkeys.

For NBC, \"The Wiz\" combines two of TV's biggest trends: live programming and the growing appetite for diversity \u2014 both in terms of casting and programming that best reflect society today.

Unusual sight: The pensioner has now taken to the water in a floating caravan, seen in recent days chugging along down The Swale between the Isle of Sheppey and Kent coast . Puzzled locals, who have watched the bizarre contraption in disbelief, said the owner is a keen boatman in his '70s or 80s\u2019 and lives in nearby Sittingbourne. Some residents had theorized that the man built the craft to appease his wife, who was said to hate sailing but love caravaning. However a close friend of the handyman said that the couple actually split two years ago, and his friend built the craft as a way of coping with his grief. \u2018And fisherman Trevor Ryan, 63, added: \u2018He bought the catamaran and then he fitted the caravan on it and launched it from Iron Wharf boatyard. Close-up: The caravan has been fixed to the base of a catamaran fitted with a small engine - and while there is a flimsy-looking fence around the vehicle, there are no other obvious safety measures . \u2018He is about 70 or 80 years old and he has got a few yachts and boats in the harbour but for some reason he has obviously built this caravan. I don't know why he has done it.

A decorated female police officer who sued Britain's biggest police force for racial discrimination after claiming she was called a n***** by a colleague has won her case and will return to work. Ricky Haruna, 39, whose duties included guarding Kate Middleton, said she was fired from London's Metropolitan Police last June after complaining about racism and launched a case for harassment and wrongful dismissal. She is now returning to duty after an appeals tribunal backed her claims. PC Haruna was sacked from the force after what she called a 'malicious arrest' over an alleged fraud, one of three claims which led to her dismissal, and which she was later cleared of. She told the tribunal the Met only took disciplinary action against her because she pursued the racism complaints. She said: 'There was no evidence on which any reasonable, unbiased panel would have dismissed me.' The racist abuse started in 2010 when a suspected shoplifter called her 'midnight' - a racist term used in South London. She said instead of supporting her other officers present 'appeared to laugh'. She added she did not receive support from senior officers when she told them a colleague called her 'a n*****'. She said: 'After that I was harassed and \u00ad victimised by racist police officers and those that support and cover up for racists in senior management.' She also said she was excluded from a staff Christmas dinner, telling the tribunal: 'I was the only black police officer and only female police officer based in that office at the time and I felt singled out and picked on.'

She is pictured holding the two commendations which she was awarded by the force in 2007 . Although she cannot speak about the case as she is now re-employed by the force, her lawyer Lawrence Davies said: 'She was devastated to be unlawfully dismissed and elated to be reinstated. 'She very much looks forward to rebuilding her career in the Met Police,' he told the Sunday Mirror. He previously said: 'When PC Haruna reported the bullying in the workplace, rather than support her, the Met's response was to target her and sack her.' PC Haruna joined the Met in January 2002 after graduating in sociology and criminology from Goldsmiths, \u00adUniversity of London. She saved the lives of two people during her career and was awarded two commendations. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'Her disciplinary process was prompted by a public complaint regarding alleged criminal conduct which was investigated by the Directorate of Professional Standards.

The tricky winger scored and set up another in Palace\u2019s win which left Queens Park Rangers deep in the relegation quagmire. When the debate rages about who should play in the Under 21 tournaments, Barclays Premier League managers often prefer their stars to skip them. Wilfried Zaha celebrates with Crystal Palace team-mates after his opener at Selhurst Park on Saturday . Shaun Wright-Phillips made his first Premier League start for 770 days. But Pardew has taken the unusual step of backing Zaha for the tournament and will speak to Southgate about including him. \u2018I would love Wilf to be on that trip because that is a big tournament for England,\u2019 Pardew said. \u2018Particularly after the Champions League results this year and England didn\u2019t do well in the World Cup so I think Gareth should have the best players available and I\u2019m hoping Wilf is one of them. But Gareth\u2019s choice won\u2019t be determined by a phone call from me, he is his own man. \u2018Wilf has definitely found himself a little bit more and I think Gareth would like somebody in the squad who has the kind of quality that he does. But he\u2019s got to do it between now and the end of the year and push for a place in that squad \u2014 that should be a goal for him.\u2019 Zaha\u2019s counterpart on the opposite flank Yannick Bolasie also starred in the victory, twice beating QPR\u2019s teenage right-back Darnell Furlong to get to the byline and send in low crosses \u2014 one for Zaha\u2019s goal and the other for James McArthur to score. Zaha slides in to open the scoring during the 3-1 win over relegation threatened Queens Park Rangers . Furlong was run ragged and eventually hooked at the break. Bolasie admitted he targeted the 19-year-old as a weak link in the team. \u2018My aim was to go at him straight away,\u2019 he said. \u2018He ain\u2019t going to come here and I\u2019m not going to let him settle, so that was my aim to be honest. I know it\u2019 s cruel, that\u2019s football. \u2018A couple of the players spoke to me and I wasn\u2019t aware [of him], because I don\u2019 t really look at the opposition like that. But that was the aim.\u2019 Furlong was at least not at fault for the third goal, which came from the other flank when Zaha tricked his way through a couple of players before passing to Joel Ward to net for Palace for the very first time.

QPR\u2019s Matt Phillips scored a goal-of-the-season contender with a 40-yard drive in the final 10 minutes, but it was too late and defeat left them four points adrift of safety. Manager Chris Ramsey laid part of the blame on his players, saying: \u2018They have realised there are only a certain amount of things you can do in preparation but you have to transfer it in the game. \u2018Sometimes I go and watch games and don\u2019t get in until 2am.

The Bajau people are known as the 'sea gipsies,' as they spend most of their time living on boats and working in the turquoise Pacific Ocean. Photographer R\u00e9hahn\u00a0spent eight days among the sea nomad children in Borneo, learning about their fascinating aquatic lives. Scroll down for video . Like a fish! The Bajau children in Borneo spend time on boats from an early age, and begin their hunting around the age of eight . French photographer, R\u00e9hahn, 35, said the friendly children loved him taking their pictures and seemed happy to see a foreigner . R\u00e9hahn uses a Canon 5d Mark III to capture his stunning pictures, and spent eight days living among the tribe to learn about their lives . The Bajau live in small boats or stilted huts, relying on their extensive knowledge of the ocean to make a living through fishing. The young children learn from a young age how to swim or dive, and start their hunting as young as eight years old. Despite many of them not knowing their ages, or written communication,\u00a0R\u00e9hahn described the peace and serenity that emanated from the water tribe. 'The children are like fish in the sea. Young children are sometimes on the boat alone, but all seemed very happy to see a foreigner,' the 35-year-old French photographer said. 'Children were jumping from a wooden bridge and they wanted me to take their photo. They were perfect models.' The Bajau tribe's beliefs centre around a combination of animism and Islam, with their relationship with the ocean and its inhabitants being at the heart of the nomads' existence. Happy and content! R\u00e9hahn said the sea gipsies were like fish in the water, and spent a lot of their time jumping happily into the water from a bridge . Due to extended periods under the surface, the sea nomads have an enhanced underwater-vision, perfect for spearfishing . R\u00e9hahn said: 'When I arrived, children jumped on the boat to come near me. Some families invited me to their house' Being around water from a young age results in the best divers being able to stay submerged at depths of 20 metres for several minutes, while they hunt for fish. The hunter-gathers mainly use spearfishing to get their produce, but can dive for pearls and sea cucumbers. Studies have shown that  youngsters have exceptionally good underwater-vision due to being constantly in the ocean environment. As diving is such a big part of their lives, often their ear drums rapture at an early age. Regardless of their age, everyone in the Bajau tribe has a place and helps in some way to catch the fish .

Some families invited me to their house.' Although some of the seafaring tribe are born on the ocean and never live on the land, more frequently the sea gypsies are heading to the shore for trade and to gather materials to build boats. R\u00e9hahn said the Bajau roughly know about age but time doesn't matter much to them, and they live in the present, and live only for and by the water. Some female sea gipsies give birth on their huts with stilts, although many come to land to trade and get supplies, there are a small number who have lived entirely on the ocean throughout their whole lives .

Afzal Amin, who is standing in a key marginal seat, is accused of asking the English Defence League to say it was organising an inflammatory march against a local 'mega-mosque'. It is claimed he did not intend the march to go ahead, but wanted to hold phoney talks with the group to get it to call off the march, and gain credit for defusing the situation just before the general election. Tory candidate\u00a0Afzal Amin\u00a0has vowed to clear his name after he was recorded apparently plotting with a far-Right group to win votes by stirring up religious tensions . Tory ministers yesterday urged him to stand down, but Mr Amin \u2013 who has been suspended from the party pending an inquiry \u2013 denied the claims and insisted he had been 'grossly misrepresented'. In secret filming, he is heard telling EDL leaders that he would also pay for the group's supporters to canvass on his behalf, and would be their 'unshakeable ally' in Parliament if elected. Defence Minister Anna Soubry said that if the allegations were true, Mr Amin should 'fess up and go now'. She added: 'If this is right, this is dreadful. I mean the EDL is the most appalling organisation'. The party had high hopes for 40-year-old Mr Amin, a Muslim and an ex-Army captain who has done three tours of duty in Afghanistan. The former teacher had become an education officer and was said to have worked with Princes William and Harry. He was filmed  telling EDL leaders that he would also pay for the group's supporters to canvass on his behalf . Former Tory party chairman Baroness Warsi has apparently met Mr Amin on several occasions over the past seven years, and called on his expertise as one of the highest-ranking Muslim soldiers. Mr Amin, who faces a disciplinary hearing tomorrow, was selected two years ago to fight the marginal seat of Dudley North. It is held by Labour's Ian Austin with a majority of only 649. A month ago, a real demonstration about the city's \u00a318million mosque by 600 EDL supporters inflamed tensions and led to 30 arrests. Mr Amin appears to have suggested last week to the EDL's former leader Tommy Robinson and current chairman Steve Eddowes that they announce a 'second march about the mosque'. At restaurant, he is heard telling them: 'We all play our roles, you say, 'Yeah we're going to do a march...' He proposes that after a second meeting with him, and police and Muslim leaders, they hold a press conference 'where you say, 'We were going to do a march. The chief [of] police asked Afzal Amin, members of the Muslim community, we've sat together and... we're going to work closely together'. In the footage, filmed by Mr Robinson and obtained by the Mail on Sunday, he is heard to say: 'This is my fantasy... if I could demonstrate to the people in Dudley that I can be a positive voice for community cohesion, for development, for campaigning against the evils and the terrorism and child grooming and all the rest of it, then that would help me a lot in the election.' He is said to have spoken to the men again later in the week saying he wanted their activists to canvass for him and offering to pay them 'a small salary' \u2013 which would be a breach of election rules. Mr Amin hatched a scheme to persuade the English Defence League (pictured) to announce an inflammatory march against a new \u00a318million 'mega-mosque' But Mr Amin claimed last night that he never planned to 'behave in the way that was presented' and that he was using the tactics he learned while negotiating between the US Army and the Taliban 'to improve community relations here in my own country between the EDL and Muslim communities'. The father of two said on the BBC that the idea he would carry out the protest was 'a fantasy'. He said he had held talks with EDL for a year, intending to 'prevent further communal tensions and violence'. He added in a statement: 'During a time of heated tensions between various communities in our country, it's vital that we tackle these problems and take difficult, sometimes uncomfortable, steps. 'I made sure I involved Chief Superintendent Chris Johnson from the start and I made clear, which is evident in the recordings, that I refused to do anything illegal'.

Drop everything. Now 10 days into the job and confronted by his third and most difficult match, a barrage of advice from those friends and family has landed. Drop everyone. Two dismal draws against relegation candidates Livingston and Alloa, stretching the winless run to five matches, has damned the playing provision at Ibrox now operating under their third manager of a sorry season that McCall was hired to rescue. He has not been short of suggestions aimed at helping him carry out that brief picked up from Kenny McDowall. \u2018I\u2019ve got family and a lot of friends who are Rangers supporters and, if it was up to them, they wouldn\u2019t have a team out there because everyone would be dropped,\u2019 said McCall. \u2018If you speak to supporters, they are so frustrated and disappointed. Stuart McCall has encountered a tricky start to his spell as Rangers manager . \u2018You speak to one fan who wouldn\u2019t have him in, and another who wouldn\u2019t have him in, and so on. Kenny tried all different permutations up front with our five strikers. It\u2019s the same with the backline and the midfield. \u2018People have said it to me: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have him, him or him in the team\u201d. But that would leave us with about two players and I can\u2019t flood the team with youngsters. My job is to get the best formula \u2014 a winning formula. We\u2019ve got time to do it and it\u2019s what I\u2019m striving to do.\u2019 The emergency work on a squad ravaged by a confidence slump is required for many reasons and some can be traced back to the recruitment \u2014 on bumper contracts \u2014 of several top-flight players who have failed to live up to being Rangers players even at a lower level. But McCall believes that a more recent explanation for the disarray in his inheritance, which includes four unfit Newcastle loan men, is that their direct competitors for promotion \u2014 and today\u2019s opponents Hibernian \u2014 were able to be clever in January. Rangers, meanwhile, were chaotic. Hibs have won their past seven games in all competitions since deadline day, reached the Scottish Cup semi-final and are now unbeaten in 15 matches \u2014 a streak of results that stuttering Rangers have at no stage looked capable of stringing together. McCall joked that if his family and friends had their way that everybody would be dropped . McCall noted: \u2018The key thing for them was the January transfer window when they managed to keep their best young player, Scott Allan, while we had to sell Lewis Macleod, who was ours. On top of that, they were able to add five players. \u2018I remember saying to Alan Stubbs at the time what a great piece of business it was to bring in Keith Watson from Dundee United because he\u2019s a really solid Premiership player. Fraser Fyvie, Tomas Cerny, Franck Dja Djedje and Martin Boyle have really strengthened their squad. \u2018While they were doing that, Rangers brought in five players from Newcastle and only one of them has been able to play a part. Alan had a clean sweep of his playing staff last summer. It took them time to gel but right now they have energy and confidence and they are hungry as well. So this will be a big challenge for us.\u2019 McCall dug into the reserve reaches of the squad to promote the impressive 18-year-old Tom Walsh. A dozen years his elder, Dean Shiels completed a game for only the second time this season. As McCall seeks that winning formula, he has a frustrated and often frustrating figure offering to be an intriguing ingredient today on a return to Easter Road. \u2018I spoke to Dean before we picked him for the Alloa game,\u2019 said McCall. \u2018I don\u2019 t know why he\u2019s only had four starts this season. Obviously, there are reasons and Dean will be a big part of that. But he did well the other night for a rare 90 minutes. \u2018Everyone is in the same boat \u2014 when you get an opportunity, you have to grab it. You\u2019ve got to show that you want to be out there, in training and games. New boss McCall takes charge of a Rangers training session . \u2018I know there are players here who want to be in my team. It\u2019s OK being willing and wanting to do it. But there\u2019s a big difference between that and actually producing. \u2018Next season, Rangers need young, hungry players. Of course, you need to balance it with experience. But I\u2019d like to have energy and vibrance in the team next season.\u2019 Darren McGregor, having met the appearance stipulations on his contract, will be back for another season. He can bid to be as energetic and vibrant as McCall wishes but it is defensive fortitude that the boyhood Hibernian supporter will be determined to bring today to a Rangers team that have lost their past three to the capital club. The 29-year-old has filled in at right-back \u2014 rather than his favoured centre-half slot \u2014 too often this season but refuses to blame that adjustment for personal form that he admits has fallen below standard. \u2018I\u2019ve been disappointed with how I\u2019ve played,\u2019 conceded McGregor. \u2018I need to take accountability as a defender. Rangers have limped to unconvincing draws against Livingston and Alloa under McCall . \u2018We\u2019ve conceded too many goals. I\u2019ve played the majority of our games, so I need to say that I could have done better in certain aspects. \u2018Everyone knows that I\u2019m not a natural right-back. But I\u2019d rather play in that position than be in the stand. \u2018To be fair to the previous manager and this manager, their hands have been forced a bit of the time because of injuries. \u2018But I can\u2019t keep going over old ground. The nine games coming up are the most important of the season. I\u2019m looking at this period as a sort of mini-league in itself. \u2018It will be time for reflection, finger-pointing and talking about where it went wrong in the summer. But we have to be positive and think that, as long as we get up, in years to come that will be forgotten about. \u2018I want my first season at Rangers to be capped with promotion. I don\u2019t want it to be a failure, which it currently is. \u2018To come back next season as a Premiership player would be special. We all know what the fans expect and the prestige of playing for this club. We\u2019ve fallen short of that this year but, if we can get up, it will put some light on an otherwise dark season.\u2019", "reference": "Stuart McCall has endured a tricky start to spell as Rangers manager .\nRangers have limped to draws against Livingston and Alloa .\nMcCall joked that everybody would be dropped if his friends had their way ."}, "330": {"id": "b5997ce1d817cd984e50b50ed08f35b58ca71194", "article": "Two New York cops that plied an alleged rape victim with alcohol before one attempted to grope her, have admitted to wrongdoing but will get to keep their jobs. The incident occurred when the two NYPD officers, Lukasz Skorzewski, 31, and Lt. Adam Lamboy, 44, flew to Seattle, Washington, to interview an alleged rape victim in July 2013. They ended up buying the 24-year-old rounds of drinks for nine hours, before Skorzewski took her back to their hotel, where he tried to tear off her clothes and grope her. During the encounter he allegedly told her 'You're my favorite victim.'

Lukasz Skorzewski, 31, left, and Lt. Adam Lamboy, 44, pleaded guilty to departmental charges after the unidentified 24-year-old woman's allegations made their way to the media. They get to keep their jobs . Both policemen were hit with departmental charges after the unidentified woman's allegations made their way to the media. The two officers pleaded guilty to the charges on Monday,\u00a0The New York Daily News reported. Skorzewski was demoted from detective after the trip, and was docked 30 vacation days and suspended for 10 days without pay as a result of pleading guilty. He has been transferred to the Medical Division in Queens on a year's probation. 'What the detective did was immoral, certainly. It was wrong. But it wasn't criminal,' a police source told the Daily News. Lamboy was already under investigation for overtime payments that he had not worked. He pleaded guilty to that charge too and was ordered to pay back more than $5,000 for 76 hours. For both charges he was docked 45 vacation days and suspended for 15 without pay. He has been transferred to Police Service Area 9 Viper in Flushing, Queens, a public housing unit. Lamboy lost his command as head of the NYPD's Manhattan Special Victims Division. Police Commissioner Bill Bratton will have to approve the final punishment. Sonia Ossorio, president of the National Organization for Women's New York City chapter, said in a statement:\u00a0'The idea of a special victims detective making a pass at a rape victim when he's charged with interviewing her about that rape shatters any notion of confidence in the NYPD's ability to regulate itself.' 'It's so far beyond the bounds of acceptability.' The alleged victim said that on the day of the incident she had lunch with Skorzewski, a married father of two, at a Seattle restaurant called the Skillet Diner. He spent time asking questions about her January 2013 rape case in which she alleges she was attacked by a man in a Union Square apartment in New York City. She was then taken to the Pier 58 tourist area to meet his boss, Lamboy. Sonia Ossorio of the National Organization for Women's New York chapter, says the case\u00a0shatters  confidence in the NYPD's ability to regulate itself . She told The New York Daily News: 'Looking back, it was totally naive of me to join them. But I was like, 'This is really cool.' I really looked up to them.' 'Luke was actually the one who said, 'I don't know if you're going to be able to come because we're going to be drinking. 'But when I dropped him off, the lieutenant was the one who said, 'Oh, no, you should stay, come on,' she recalled. 'I was going through this all alone. My family didn't know,' she said. 'It felt good that they were being so nice.' They then went to Paddy Coyne's Irish Pub, but Skorzewski was so drunk that servers refused to give him any more alcohol. Later, they headed to Cha Cha Lounge in Capitol Hill and then moved on to Unicorn, with the cops flashing their badges to cut the line. She said that she attempted to leave at around midnight, but they begged her to stay. They even pleaded with her to call in sick to her job as a Starbucks barista the next morning. She was drunk and unable to drive, so she went with them after they assured her that she would be safe if she stayed with them at their hotel. They  took her back to their hotel room at the Embassy Suites hotel in nearby Bellevue, Washington. Once there, Skorzewski loaned her some clothes and slept on the couch, she said. But when they woke up with hangovers, Skorzewski climbed in bed with her as they watched TV and  asked to put his arm around her. She claims he said: 'I really want to kiss you right now.' He also wanted to 'feel her up.' She describes how he tried to work his way into her pants to tear them off but she pushed his hand away. The next day, both policemen visited her at Starbucks and promised to stay in touch. Pub: The accuser claimed Skorzewski had been so drunk that servers at an Irish bar in downtown Seattle refused to give him any more alcohol . She said Skorzewski called her almost daily from New York for a month but the calls soon stopped, and she was 'crushed.' She quizzed him about why he had become distant in an e-mail but he became angry suggesting that she had screwed up his personal life. She later saw Skorzewski in New York in October 2013 for a 'call' to the man who allegedly attacked her in January of that year. But the man was never charged. Skorzewski soon stopped returning her calls altogether, so she  sent a letter to a family friend in the NYPD which led to a call from the Internal Affairs Bureau. She told Internal\u00a0affairs\u00a0what happened and gave them evidence, including photos from the boozy night out, text messages and phone records which showed two-hour long calls with Skorzewski.

Alex Salmond has threatened to bring down a Conservative minority government, even if David Cameron wins more seats than Ed Miliband. The former Scottish First Minister said the Scottish National Party would vote down a Tory Queen's Speech if it holds the balance of power after the general election. Latest polls suggest the SNP will gain dozens of seats in Scotland, depriving Labour of a majority and able to call the shots in Westminster. Mr Salmond suggested that jettisoning an attempt by the Conservatives to govern alone would allow the SNP to prop up a minority Labour administration. The Tories said it was proof the SNP would 'sabotage the democratic will of the British people' to install Mr Miliband in Downing Street. Speaking to the New Statesman magazine, Mr Salmond said the SNP could enter a 'confidence and supply' arrangement with Labour - under which the smaller party would agree not to bring down a minority government in return for concessions on particular priorities. But he said it was more probable that it would offer its support on a vote-by-vote basis and would make amendments to any budget put forward by Ed Balls to introduce 'progressive tax measures'. With opinion polls suggesting the SNP are headed for dozens of gains from Labour and the Liberal Democrats north of the border, Mr Salmond - who is standing in the Gordon seat being vacated by veteran Lib Dem Sir Malcolm Bruce - would say only that he expects the party to win 'a barrel-load' of seats at Westminster. He predicted that Lib Dems would not be 'a big factor' in negotiations on forming the new government, as 'if the Liberals are reduced to half their MPs the last thing they're going to be doing is going into a coalition'. 'The surviving half will want to survive,' he said. This would mean the SNP, unionist parties from Northern Ireland and other smaller parties would be crucial to the outcome. Mr Salmond rejected Labour's argument that the party with the most seats after the May 7 poll will have the opportunity to form the government, insisting that the key question is which leader can command a majority in the Commons. 'The Tories would have to go straight effectively for a vote of confidence - usually the Queen's Speech, although it could be otherwise, of course, and we'd be voting against,' said Mr Salmond. 'So if Labour joins us in that pledge, then that's Cameron locked out.\u00a0And then under the (Fixed-Term) Parliaments Act that the Westminster parliament's passed but nobody seems to have read, you'd then have a two-week period to form another government - and of course you want to form another government because this might be people's only chance to form another government.' The SNP would act to prop up a Labour government with Ed Miliband in Number 10, even if David Cameron wins more seats . Although Mr Cameron would remain incumbent Prime Minister until a new government was formed, the Act - passed by the coalition in 2011 - would restrict his ability to call a new election in the hope of securing a decisive result, said Mr Salmond. The former SNP leader said he had 'no idea' whether a Labour government emerging from such a process would have Mr Miliband as its leader, and suggested that he was wrong to have ruled out formal coalition with the SNP so firmly . 'If I were him, I wouldn't have ruled it out,' said Mr Salmond. 'Nicola (Sturgeon, the SNP leader) has always said that she thought full coalition was unlikely. But she didn't rule it out: she said it was highly unlikely ... It's still highly unlikely.' Asked what he saw as the probable outcome, Mr Salmond said: 'I think probable would be vote-by-vote (support for Labour), and possible would be confidence and supply.' A new poll of voters in Scotland this week put Labour down to just 27 per cent, which\u00a0Professor John Curtice says could leave the party with just two MPs, the same number as the Tories . Mr Salmond said it was 'bad politics' for Mr Cameron to float the prospect of English votes for English laws on the morning after last year's independence referendum and said it was now 'not a question of if, but when' a second referendum on separation from the rest of the UK would take place. A Conservative spokesman said: 'Alex Salmond has confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister. 'That would mean chaos for Britain, with weak Ed Miliband dancing to Alex Salmond's tune.

Mark Tomat, 26, this week admitted to a judge that he and his girlfriend Tara Bradbury, 23, took heroin at her home in Wyckoff on Valentine's Day 2014. Last month, Bradbury - who comes from an upper-middle class New Jersey community - gave birth to a second child while she was being treated at an intensive program - to ensure she didn't take any more drugs to harm her unborn son. Mark Tomat, 26, admitted to a judge that he and his girlfriend Tara Bradbury, 23, took heroin at her home in Wyckoff last February. Bradbury's nine-month-old baby accidentally ingested the drug . Tomat said he left the narcotic lying around the house and learned Bradbury's baby had ingested the drug about an hour after he left  that night. Police found text messages between the two in which they talked about a plan to deny that they knew the baby had eaten heroin - so as not to incriminate themselves. Paramedics responding to a 911 call found the infant unresponsive and with a bruised forehead. The baby recovered after it was administered Narcan, an antidote for heroin overdose. Bradbury, who is from the upper-middle-class community Indian Hills, was sentenced to drug court, which means she will be provided with ongoing treatment in an intensely supervised drug treatment program.

The extent of the double world champion\u2019s memory loss has been revealed in El Pais, a daily newspaper close to Alonso and his management. They reported that when asked who he was, Alonso replied: \u2018I\u2019m Fernando, I drive go-karts and I want to be a Formula One driver.\u2019 Fernando Alonso waves as he leaves hospital but it has been reported he was confused when waking up . In 1995, Alonso was a 13-year-old pupil at Holy Guardian Angel School in his home town of Oviedo, northern Spain. When doctors pressed him further, Alonso, 33, could not remember his debut with Minardi in 2001 or his world championships for Renault in 2005 and 2006. The reports in Spain came 48 hours after Sportsmail revealed concerns that Alonso may have an underlying condition that caused him to crash a week last Sunday and which throw his future career into doubt. Alonso gives the thumbs up after his crash. McLaren have refused to comment on his medical state . Despite MRI and CT scans during three nights in hospital in Barcelona and further tests in Oviedo on Monday, there are no assurances from his doctors, management or McLaren team that he will return for the Malaysian Grand Prix on March 29. He has already been ruled out of the opening race in Melbourne on Sunday week. The concussion he suffered in Barcelona means he cannot be exposed to a second knock to the head, which doctors fear could kill him, regardless of the wider questions about his health. A McLaren spokesman said: \u2018As regards Fernando\u2019s medical situation, McLaren will not and indeed should not take the lead, since his medical care is being handled by the people best equipped for that task, namely his doctors. \u2018So all we can say is that he is making good progress, and that we hope and expect he will soon be back to his brilliant best.\u2019 Alonso is reported by El Pais to have said:\u00a0'I'm Fernando, I drive go karts and I want to be a Formula 1 driver' White screens are lifted as Alonso is treated and taken to an air ambulance following his crash . Medics act quickly to ensure Alonso is secure as he is wheeled closer to a waiting air ambulance . McLaren staff are not necessarily close to Alonso, after he left the team in 2007 following a season of infighting, and may not even know their driver\u2019s condition as well as do some reporters in Spain do. Confusion has, therefore, surrounded the situation, not least after McLaren chairman Ron Dennis said that Alonso had not been concussed, a misunderstanding that was corrected by the team\u2019s official statements. David Coulthard, a former McLaren driver, said: \u2018My experience of getting knocked out or having big shunts is that you remember the bit before, the bit after but not the bit in the middle. When you get knocked out it does not come as a warning; it just happens. The McLaren MP4-30 of Alonso is recovered back to the pits on the back of a truck following the crash . \u2018The brain is a fairly complex bit of kit, so if they are not able to see any brain injury of any sort it seems a bit medically confusing for me, so there is probably more from the story to come out over time. It is unusual for drivers to miss a grand prix over such a thing.\u2019 Whatever the cause, Alonso\u2019s predicament is a blow for McLaren, whose form in testing suggested they are struggling very badly indeed for reliability and speed. They signed him on a \u00a328million-a-year contract at the start of their new relationship with Honda, yet will replace him with Kevin Magnussen, their 22-year-old Danish reserve driver, at Melbourne\u2019s Albert Park. A helicopter was used to transport Alonso from the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya to hospital on February 22 . Gary Hartstein, Formula One\u2019s former chief doctor, has speculated that the most probable reason Alonso might have passed out would be arrhythmia \u2014 an irregular heartbeat. If so, he would require a pacemaker. Another possibility, said Hartstein, would be carotid sinus hypersensitivity, whereby pressure on the main artery to the brain causes the heart rate to drop, blood pressure to fall and the sufferer to blackout. Hartstein told the BBC that this was \u2018surprisingly common\u2019, and not totally unexpected at a fast corner in a Formula One car, such as Turn Three at Barcelona, where Alonso was travelling at 134mph. Alonso was flown away by helicopter following the crash at the Circuit de Catalunya Barcelona . But, then again, he was braking and changing down gears as the accident unfolded, so how is this consistent with his having passed out? The questions nag. Alonso will need the FIA\u2019s medical team to give him clearance to race in Malaysia, as well as the go-ahead from his own doctors. He has been outwardly relaxed about missing the Melbourne race, saying from his father\u2019s house in Oviedo, where he is recovering: \u2018A second impact in less than 21 days (the stipulated period of rest) \u2014 NO.\u2019 Alonso may have been less sanguine if McLaren were quicker, but both team and man will be mightily relieved when, he is back, even if it is towards the back of the grid for now.

Leading motor magazine Autocar produced images of how the sleek new two-seater to be built at Crewe would look. But there was a chance tonight to see the real thing in the metal.

And though already widely dubbed Bentley\u2019s new \u2018baby\u2019, bosses stressed that it will not be a noticeably small car, despite having fewer seats and just two doors. It is set to sit alongside the existing Bentley Continental GT rather than below it, say insiders. The British-based but German-owned luxury car firm is part of the giant Volkswagen Group and employs nearly 4,000 people at Crewe. The car was the star of the packed Volkswagen Group night in Geneva which attracted hundreds of journalists and executives.

But we\u2019re working on it. Bentley is on track to double its record sales to more than 20,000 on the back of the new 4x4 to be unveiled later this year, before going on sale next year at around \u00a3130,000. Last year Bentley sold a record 11,020 sportily luxurious limousines, coupes and cabriolets. But Bentley expects the new sports utility vehicle to increase sales to 20,000 a year by the end of the decade after hitting 15,000 deliveries by 2018 - and is already expanding its factory to cope with it and other new models. Bentley\u2019s chief executive Wolfgang Duerheimer said last month: \u2018We think the success of the SUV will lift us into a new dimension.\u2019 He added that Bentley would remain British, even if the UK voted to leave the European Union, saying: \u2018The bright future is based in Britain and in Crewe.\u2019 Bentley said more than 4,000 potential customers have already expressed an interest in the new luxury off-roader without having seen it. He added: \u2019There\u2019s a lot we could do. The idea of a fifth line is attractive. We seriously not short of ideas but a small car could be something we could do.\u2019 \u2019The advantage of a smaller car is that it would enable us to have something to go up against Aston Martin or Maserati.\u2019 However, small will not mean cheap - as prices are expected to range from \u00a3120,000 to \u00a3140,000. Regarding the forthcoming Bentayga 4x4, Mr Rose added: \u2018There\u2019s nothing to say James Bond might not drive a sports utility vehicle.\u2019 Autocar editor-in-chief Steve Cropley said Bentley was out to \u2018steal Aston Martin\u2019s lunch\u2019. He said: \u2019Bentley will unveil a super performance front-engined two-seat sports GT at the Geneva Motor Show. \u2018It is a preview to a new model aimed squarely at stealing sales from Aston Martin and Ferrari.\u2019 He noted: \u2018Bentley is likely to say the car\u2019s main purpose is to test the reaction of potential new customers.\u2019 But Bentley\u2019s well-established track record is to show first, then build later. Mr Cropley said: \u2018The new two-seat coupe would extend Bentley\u2019s product portfolio to five distinct models.\u2019 In the original Ian Fleming books, Bond drove a powerful \u2018blowers\u2019 Bentley with a supercharged engine.

To\u00a0'folks who are basing their entire political agenda on repealing the law, ' he said, 'you\u2019ve got to explain how kicking millions of families off their insurance is somehow going to make us more free' He and his allies were eventually defeated in that effort after a two-week stand off with Democrats, who held the majority in the upper chamber at the time. But he has continued to fight to have the law nullified and named repeal a top priority in a speech announcing his candidacy for higher office on Monday. The White House was won't to react that afternoon to Cruz's entry into the 2016 brawl but it did rib him over his campaign promise to throw out the sitting president's signature policy achievement.

In a twist of irony, Cruz said Tuesday that he would sign his family up for Obamacare. Previously included in a plan in the name of his wife, a Goldman Sachs employee, Cruz's family will lose its health care soon as she leaves her job to join him full time on the campaign trail. Earnest resisted taking a shot at Cruz over the matter on Wednesday, saying that if he does apply for a plan via the government marketplace, 'he will find is what millions of Americans across the country have found,' which is that there are good quality healthcare plans available  because of the health care reform law. While others have pointed out the irony of the situation, 'I am seeking to merely point out the common experience that it seems that the Cruz family may be sharing,' Earnest told a reporter pressing him on the issue. At the event on Wednesday, Obama said critics of the law need to explain 'why forcing millions of families to pay thousands of dollars more will somehow make us more secure. Or why we should go back to the days when women paid more for coverage than men' and a 'preexisting condition locked so many of us out of insurance.' The president said that because of the law, 'If you\u2019re a woman, you can no longer be charged more just for being a woman. 'And you know there are a lot of women. Like more than 50 percent,' he said, eliciting laughter from attendees of the White House-sponsored event for private and public sector health care workers. 'This law is also saving lives - lives that touch all of us,' he said. 'It\u2019s working despite countless attempts to repeal, undermine, defund, and defame this law.' Defending the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare after its biggest backer, the president, Obama said, 'It\u2019s not the \u201cjob-killer\u201d that critics have warned about for five years.' In fact, after it was passed, 'businesses began the longest streak of private-sector job growth on record,' he said, noting that the economy has added 12 million new jobs in the last 60 months. 'It\u2019s not the fiscal disaster critics warned about for five years. Health care prices are rising at the slowest rate in nearly 50 years, which has helped cut our deficit by two-thirds since I took office,' he contended. Before the Affordable Care Act went into effect, health care costs were projected to be the 'single biggest driver' of new deficits. 'Today, health care is the single biggest factor driving those projections down,' he said. 'We have been promised a lot of things these past five years that didn\u2019t turn out to be the case: death panels, doom. A serious alternative from Republicans in Congress,' he said. The comment was a subtle jab at Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz, who has zealously fought to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Cruz, pictured here on Monday at his campaign kick off, led a 2013 filibuster in the Senate that he hoped would result in a successful vote to defund the health care reform law, making it easier to legislatively dismantle . Obama said the reason that Republicans are having such a difficult time coming up with an alternative to his plan to reform the healthcare system is because it was 'pretty much was their plan before I adopted it.' Repeating past claims, Obama said the ACA is 'based on conservative, market-based principles developed by the Heritage Foundation and supported by Republicans in Congress, and deployed by a guy named Mitt Romney in Massachusetts to great effect. 'If they want to take credit for this law, they can. I\u2019m happy to share it,' he added. The president acknowledged that his administration has 'made our share of mistakes since we passed this law.' 'But we also know beyond a shred of a doubt that the policy has worked,' he said. 'Coverage is up. Cost growth is at a historic low. Deficits have been slashed. Lives have been saved.' 'So if anybody wants to join us in the spirit of the people who have put aside differences to come here today and help make the law work even better, come on board,' he said, trolling Republicans. To GOP lawmakers who want to get rid of the law, he pointed to 28-year-old Obamacare recipient Anne Ha, a Philadelphia business owner who was present for his remarks, made from the South Court of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which is located next door to the White House. 'She thought what many of us think when we're young...that she was too young, too healthy to bother with health insurance. She went to the gym every day. She ate healthy, looks great, felt invincible. Why pay a doctor just to tell her she\u2019s okay?' Ha bought healthcare insurance from the federal marketplace that was created by Obamacare at the behest of her mother, he said. And four months later she was diagnosed with stomach cancer, for which she underwent chemo therapy and surgery. 'Today, she\u2019s recovering. She looks great. She\u2019s here with us at the Whte House. She invited me to her wedding,' he said. 'I told her you don't want the President at her wedding.' Because Anne was covered under Obamacare and had her cancer diagnosed early, he said, she is now healthy and will be able to follow through with a September wedding to her fianc\u00e9 Tom. 'And she\u2019s convinced him to get covered, too,' Obama stated. The president said he and First Lady Michelle appreciated Ha's invitation to her wedding, but 'as I said, we have to mag people at the wedding, and it spoils the fun.'", "reference": "President made a subtle jab at Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz, who has zealously fought to repeal the Affordable Care Act .\n'Folks who are basing their entire political agenda on repealing the law, you\u2019ve got to explain how kicking millions of families off their insurance is somehow going to make us more free,' he said .\nCritics also need to explain 'why forcing millions of families to pay thousands of dollars more will somehow make us more secure,' he said ."}, "339": {"id": "b175cae047af24a3da580637268aac6756fcabad", "article": "(CNN)Latest developments: . Full story: . Saudi Arabia has launched military operations in neighboring Yemen, where for months Houthi rebels have intensified their violent campaign against the government, the Saudi ambassador to the United States told reporters in Washington on Wednesday. Adel al-Jubeir said the operation consisted of airstrikes on more than one city and in more than one region. Yemen, a longtime stronghold for one of al Qaeda's most dangerous branches, has been plunged into chaos since the Houthi rebels began seizing control of the capital and other areas of the country in recent months. The unrest has led to the withdrawal of U.S. special forces from Yemen, seriously undermining counterterrorism efforts there. How did Yemen get to this place? \"We are determined to protect the legitimate government of Yemen,\" al-Jubeir said. \"Having Yemen fail cannot be option for us or for our coalition partners.\" A leading member of the Houthis' political wing, Ansar Allah, said force will be met with force. \"This is a clear aggression and we will respond by a counteraggression,\" Ali Al Imad told CNN Arabic. \"The Saudi move will unite all the people of Yemen against the Saudis and the kingdom will pay the price.\" If the Saudis try to invade with ground troops, he said, they will fail. \"They probably will try to avoid that, but If it happened then they will pay a very high price,\" Imad said. The Saudi airstrikes appear to be targeting military compounds, headquarters and weapons storage areas. Journalist Hakim Almasmari, who is staying in the capital of Sanaa, said hundreds of explosions have caused residents to stay in their homes. \"I do expect the Sanaa of a couple of hours ago to be a different Sanaa in the morning,\" he said. A senior Arab diplomat told CNN that the Gulf Cooperation Council soon will issue a statement that the Yemenis have asked for military assistance and the GCC is prepared to step in. It will be signed by all GCC countries except for Oman. Not all countries will contribute military forces, the source said. Arab and senior administration officials from the United States told CNN that an interagency U.S. coordination team is in Saudi Arabia. The sources said the Saudis have not specified what they want yet, but will likely ask for American air support, satellite imagery, and other intelligence. \"We can help with logistics and intelligence and things like that, but there will be no military intervention by the U.S.,\" a senior administration official said. Al-Jubeir said the United States is not involved in the airstrikes against the Houthis, who are Shiites in a majority Sunni nation. But the coalition includes more than 10 nations, he said, meaning more than the six GCC countries will be involved. Yemen, which has been in turmoil for months, shares a border with southern Saudi Arabia. \"We hope that the wisdom will prevail among the Houthis and they will become part of the political process rather than continue radical approach to try to take over Yemen and destroy it,\" Al-Jubeir said. Earlier Wednesday, rebel forces captured parts of the port city of Aden and a nearby Yemeni air base recently evacuated by U.S. forces, officials in the country said, with one rebel spokesman claiming that Yemen's president fled Aden as his opponents advanced. The rebels late Wednesday morning captured al-Anad air base, an installation that the last Yemen-based contingent of U.S. special operations forces evacuated over the weekend because of the deteriorating security situation in the country, said Mohammed AbdulSalam, a spokesman for the Houthi rebels. The rebel forces -- Houthis and some allies in the Yemeni military -- then advanced on Aden, the nearby port city where President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi had taken refuge for weeks. There were conflicting reports Wednesday about Hadi's whereabouts. But one Houthi spokesman, Mohammed AlBukhaiti, said Hadi left  Aden on a boat with a Saudi diplomatic team as the rebels approached the port city. AlBukhaiti told CNN that Hadi went to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. But a Saudi Arabian source told CNN's Nic Robertson that the President was still in Yemen in the early hours Thursday. Earlier, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters, \"It's pretty clear (Hadi) left voluntarily,\" without saying where Hadi had gone. She clarified that circumstances in Yemen caused him to leave his residence, but that rebels did not expel him. Two senior administration officials said it's unclear if he left Aden. The rebels' advance illustrated the growing power the Houthis have enjoyed since taking over Sanaa in January, and illustrated a further collapse of a government that had been a key U.S. ally in the fight against then Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. For years, Yemen had allowed U.S. drones and special operations forces to stalk AQAP in the country. Now, that arrangement is in tatters, along with any semblance of peace in the Middle Eastern nation. Underscoring rebels' increasing strength, Houthi-commanded Yemeni air force jets on Wednesday dropped bombs on or fired missiles at the presidential palace in Aden for the third time in a week, causing minimal damage and injuring no one, two Hadi aides said. The airstrikes happened before reports of Hadi's departure from Aden emerged. Hadi had been staying at the Aden palace since last month, when he fled the capital, Sanaa, after a Houthi takeover there. The United States \"strongly condemn(s) the recent offensive military actions taken in Yemen that have targeted President Hadi,\" Psaki told reporters Wednesday. The Houthi militants -- Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- moved into the capital, Sanaa, in September, sparking battles that killed a few hundred people before a ceasefire was called. In January, they surrounded the presidential palace and Hadi resigned and was put under house arrest. But Hadi escaped in February, fleeing to Aden and declaring that he remained the country's leader. The Houthis took control of military forces stationed near Sanaa, including the air force. Some of the forces aligned with the Houthis also are loyal to Hadi's predecessor, former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who resigned in 2012 after months of \"Arab Spring\" protests inspired in part by a 2011 revolution in Egypt. By last week, opposing Yemeni military forces -- those loyal to the Houthis, and those answering to Hadi -- battled in Aden, with Hadi's forces temporarily pushing out the rebels on March 19 after at least 13 people were killed. On Wednesday, with the U.S. forces gone, Houthi-aligned forces took over al-Anad air base, about 40 kilometers from Aden, said AbdulSalam, one of the Houthi spokesmen. The number of casualties, if any, wasn't immediately available. Some Hadi supporters evacuated the base, and Houthi forces arrested some top officials who were there, including Hadi's defense minister, AbdulSalam said. No deaths or injuries were immediately reported in the rebels' subsequent takeover of Aden's airport and the central bank.

And it's fair to say, some pretty important pre-conference deliberations have taken place on board high above the clouds. Air Force One is the aircraft that transports Barack Obama to meetings throughout the world, and the highly-customised Boeing 747-200B has even been enjoyed by British Prime Minister David Cameron. Obama in his 'Oval Office' aboard Air Force One; here he is pictured\u00a0signing a bill that will give the Congressional Gold Medal to the Foot Soldiers who Participated in Bloody Sunday in Selma, Alabama . The mirror balls built into the wings are able to deflect infra-red missile systems, should the unthinkable happen . With 4,000 sq ft of floor space over three levels, it certainly doesn't lack n space, and includes an extensive suite for the president with a large office, lavatory, and a conference room. But it's not just the space and facilities that make the plane so ideal, it is also stacked with the latest safety equipment. According to White House information the onboard electronics are hardened to protect against an electromagnetic pulse - such as a nuclear explosion - and Air Force One is equipped with advanced secure communications equipment, allowing the aircraft to function as a 'mobile command centre'. The plane can reach speeds up to 620 miles per hour, 40 miles per hour faster than their commercial counterparts. And, according to\u00a0Business Insider, there are also mirror ball missile deflectors embedded in the wings of the plane should the aircraft come under attack. Interestingly, there are two identical planes used by the President and they are referred to as SAM 28000 and SAM 29000 when they are flying without the President on board. The cost an estimated $330million each when bought in the early 1990s for the first President Bush. There is no chance the leader of the free world will go hungry on board - the plane also has two food preparation galleys that can feed 100 people at a time. Although the plane is popularly known as Air Force One, this is technically the call sign of any Air Force aircraft carrying the President. Pictured here are George Bush with the Obamas and others as the group flew to Nelson Mandela's memorial on Air Force One back in 2013. This room is called the 'Situation Room' that can also be used for conferencing .

Capable of refuelling midair - as seen in the Harrison Ford film, Air Force One - the Boeing 747-200B aircrafts have unlimited range and don't need to land for days at a time. The planes are a powerful symbol of American power and a presidential aircraft was first used by President Kennedy. The US military has recently chosen a new Boeing model to replace its current fleet of Air Force One presidential aircrafts. The new Air Force One planes will be Boeing's commercial 747-8 airliner, replacing the old Boeing 747-200Bs. The Pentagon had considered the A380 made by European aerospace giant Airbus, but opted for home-grown talent. There appear to be plenty of meeting rooms on board so that business can continue as usual despite travelling at 35,000ft . The jet can cater for 100 people, whether they want to relax back with snacks and a drink, or perhaps a more formal meal . 'The Boeing 747-8 is the only aircraft manufactured in the United States (that) when fully missionized meets the necessary capabilities established to execute the presidential support mission,' said Air Force secretary Deborah James in a statement. Boeing welcomed the Air Force's decision to skip a competition and opt for the 747-8, citing its 50-year history of building presidential aircraft. The Air Force now operates two VC-25s, specially configured Boeing 747-200Bs. It said it planned to purchase enough of the technical baseline to permit competition for maintenance during the plane's planned 30-year life. James said the Air Force One program would use proven technologies and commercially certified equipment to keep the program affordable. The president's plane has long been a symbol of American power and the setting for historic moments, including the somber 1963 ceremony when Lyndon Johnson took the oath of office on board -- hours after the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The plane is equipped with the latest in communications and security systems, and is capable of functioning as a mobile command centre in the event of an attack on the US . The US President is pictured enjoying a joke with former leader George Bush during a flight on board Air Force One . The plane is often portrayed in Hollywood films and inspired a 1997 thriller titled 'Air Force One' in which the US president, played by Harrison Ford, fought off hijackers. Outfitted with secure communications equipment and other gear, Air Force One is designed to serve as a 'mobile command center' and served that role briefly after the attacks of September 11, 2001. It also features a suite for the commander-in-chief that includes a large office, a conference room as well as a medical area that can function as an operating room. The body of the plane is said to be able to withstand a nuclear blast from the ground and has a number of emergency exits . Following the assassination of John F. Kennedy (pictured), Lyndon Johnson took the oath of office on board Air Force One . The plane's galley can feed up to 100 people and there are additional quarters for senior aides, Secret Service agents and other staff.

It is the Dutch FA (KNVB) who are leading the way in trials of a system to aid referees. However, their bid to introduce the technology in cup matches from next season was rejected by the International Football Association Board (IFAB) last month. Referees chief Mike Riley has called for the arrival of video technology into the Premier League . Given the increasing number of controversies in the Premier League, referees\u2019 chief Mike Riley has called for its arrival in the English top-flight. But the IFAB have delayed any decision for 12 months at least, meaning the earliest we could see video assistance for referees will be the 2017/18 season. The Dutch are certainly confident their process could work. It involves a fifth official located in a video room with access to instant replays. During Eredivisie games they have been trialling how long it would take that official to make a correct judgment on key incidents only, such as red cards, penalties and fouls before goals. They have found that an average of two to three crucial decisions per game can each be resolved within five to 20 seconds, with the official having a direct audio link to the referee. Should the IFAB give the go-ahead for trials of this system \u2013 or another one \u2013 in competitive matches during the 2016/17 campaign, they would then want to see it used in a FIFA age-grade tournament before giving permission for video technology to be implemented in the Premier League and elsewhere around the world.

The latest offering, \"Gift Horse,\" which took up residence in the Square's northwest corner Thursday, looks set to continue the tradition with a work that explores the link between power, money and history, according to organizers. Unveiled by London's Mayor Boris Johnson, the sculpture created by German-born conceptual artist Hans Haacke portrays a skeletal riderless horse with an ribbon-shaped electronic ticker tied to its left leg showing live market data from London's Stock Exchange. \"'Gift Horse' is a startlingly original comment on the relationship between art and commerce and I hope it will stimulate as much debate as other works that have appeared on the plinth,\" Johnson said. The 13-feet high bronze skeleton is a \"wry comment,\" organizers say, on the equestrian statue of King William IV originally planned, but never realized for the plinth more than 150 years ago. Further nods to the past and the sculpture's location can be found in the pose which is based on the engraving \"The Anatomy of a Horse\" by English artist George Stubbs, whose famous equine portraits hang on the walls of the National Gallery on Trafalgar Square's north side. One of London's most famous landmarks, Trafalgar Square is popular with tourists. Named after a famed 1805 British naval victory against the French, its centerpiece is a column commemorating Lord Horatio Nelson, who died during the conflict. In a career spanning half-a-century, Haacke has frequently explored the interconnectedness of art, power and money through installations, paintings, photography and written text. Many of Haacke's most famous works have explored systems, be it physical -- as evidenced by his famous 1960s work \"Condensation Cube\" -- or the social and political as seen in \"MoMA Poll\" (1970), \"A Breed Apart\" (1978) and more recently his \"Der Bev\u00f6lkerung\" (The People) installed in Germany's Reichstag building in Berlin in 2000. \"It's a very prominent spot,\" said the 78-year-old, reflecting on the \"Gift Horse's\" positioning in Trafalgar Square,  \"It's very beautiful. Everybody sees it.\" \"There are other statues and the idea of having the empty plinth which has been made available periodically for artists is a great idea,\" added Haacke. Around Trafalgar Square there was mixed reaction to the sculpture. \"It definitely doesn't look like a horse's head, does it? Looks more dinosaur-ish to me,\" said a slightly baffled female day-tripper from Wales, while another tourist seemed equally confused. \"My first impression was that it looked like an alien, because you see it and then you think, huh? What is it?\" said Toni, visiting from Switzerland. Local reaction was more positive though. \"I just think it's very witty,\" said Londoner Tony Francis. \"I can see the (George) Stubbs influence. And I love the Stock Exchange (ribbon) scrolling round and the way they merge into each other.\" \"Gift Horse\" is the 10th artwork to sit on the plinth and follows the \"Hahn/Cock,\" created by German artist Katharina Fritsch which was in residence from July 2013 to February this year.", "reference": "A new sculpture for Trafalgar Square's Fourth Plinth unveiled Thursday .\n'Gift Horse' by German-born artist Hans Haacke will sit on plinth for 18 months .\nHaacke's is the 10th artwork to be displayed on the plinth ."}, "344": {"id": "0fc6e80bf4706b8079e3d5bb1f55bef9ebe85f9d", "article": "The secret of how the legendary Star Wars spaceship the Millennium Falcon was built has been revealed - in a high-security project codenamed 'Magic Roundabout' in the Welsh countryside. The only full-size model of Han Solo's iconic craft was constructed at an aircraft hangar in Pembroke Dock, west Wales, where workers were sworn to silence over what they were making. Newly released photographs show dozens of joiners, welders and metal-platers at work during the three months they spent putting together the giant freighter flown by Harrison Ford in the famous science fiction series. Scroll down for video . Engineering foreman John Clark and two friends are pictured beside the life-size Millennium Falcon model in a newly released photo of the project . The distinctive shape of the Millennium Falcon is clearly recognisable in the second photo taken by Mr Clark . A group of workers go over the plans for the massive spaceship during its construction at Pembroke Dock . It was built inside an aircraft hangar with workers involved in the project sworn to secrecy . The huge prop was made inside an aircraft hangar which had been home to the Sunderland flying boats during the Second World War. The giant steel doors were kept shut from morning until night to hide the construction - there were no unauthorised visits, photographs were banned and the workers were sworn to secrecy. But one amateur photographer managed to get a snap of the 'fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy' as it was nearing completion. The never before seen picture shows how the Millennium Falcon earned its wings in the town of Pembroke Dock. John Evans, a historian in the town, said: 'Star Wars has a global following and this is yet another great reason for tourists to come here. 'Pembroke Dock is a military town and we have people coming from far and wide to follow family footsteps, be it Navy, Army or Air Force. 'But there is also this incredible link to Star Wars which is almost a cult thing and a 21st century concept. 'People can still see the very building where the Millennium Falcon was made.' The photograph was taken by local man John Clark, a foreman with Marcon Fabrications, a heavy engineering firm that serviced the UK's petrochemical and oil industries. Work on the model (pictured) finished in 1979 and it was transported to film studios in Hertfordshire . Mr Clark recalled: 'One of the directors was in cahoots with someone with the studios or someone associated with the Star Wars films. 'I was very surprised that we'd gone that type of work because we built stuff for the oil industry and the offshore industry, but we got the contract. It was just a reasonable size team of workers that built all the framework. 'I was foreman on the job at the time. When we built it - as you can see on the photographs - we had it on hover pads on the legs so that it could be moved as though it was going to take off and so forth. 'We tried to keep it as much a secret as possible because you didn't want everybody prying and coming round the hangar, but it got out. People were prying and trying to see what was going on but half of them didn't believe it, saying: \"Building a spaceship? That's rubbish\".' He said the Millennium Falcon was then disassembled into pieces so it could be transported to the studios in Hertfordshire. 'The artists in the film industry, the craftsman, went to work on it and made it into what you see on The Empire Strikes Back.' This rare photograph was taken during the top-secret project which was codenamed Magic Roundabout . Work on the spaceship finished in 1979 and the prop was then transported to Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire . The company had been asked by filmmakers to build a life-sized, moving prop for key scenes in the second Star Wars film, The Empire Strikes Back. And Mr Clark used his pocket-sized 110 camera to get a colour photograph of himself and two friends standing next to the Millennium Falcon. Work on the spaceship finished shortly after the picture was taken in 1979 and the prop was transported to Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire. The film was released in 1980 and was a box office smash around the world. This was followed up by the third film in the trilogy, 1983's Return of the Jedi. A permanent exhibition of Star Wars photographs, artefacts and memorabilia is being opened to celebrate Pembroke Dock's links with the iconic movie franchise. Mr Evans added: 'This has been a huge thing for us. 'This is great for tourism and a very unique claim to fame for Pembroke Dock.' Han Solo's much-loved Millennium Falcon (pictured) has taken a unique place in pop culture . In the 38 years since it first appeared on the big screen, the space ship piloted by Han Solo and his Wookiee assistant Chewbacca in the original Star Wars series has become an easily recognizable piece of pop culture. Armed with laser cannons and the famed 'hyperdrive' technology, it featured in the first movie A New Hope and went on to become a regular setting throughout the series. Such is the high esteem in which fans hold it, the exact specifications of the model, its weaponry, shielding systems and engines have all been meticulously documented. The ship is technically a light freighter measuring 111ft in length by 82ft wide. While it is rounded and flat in shape, it measures 26ft high - inclusive of the attached exterior weaponry. Its maximum speed is 1,050kmph. But this is vastly surpassed when it goes into 'hyperdrive' - a mode illustrated in the films when the stars surrounding it appear stretched or blurred as it travels through light years within the space of hours. The ship is powered by five different engines - primarily a 'Quadrex power core' and four backup or emergency generators. Its main weapons are 2G Quad Laster cannons and a hidden ground-defence blaster cannon, though many other improvised weapons make brief appearances in the films. Capable of carrying six passengers, it is crewed by two people - those usually being Han Solo or Chewbacca - with provisions for two others to man guns during space battles.

The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) today released a new framework, which advises doctors on how to care for children and babies with life-limiting and life-threatening conditions. It asks medics to weight up the benefits of prolonged treatment versus the suffering the young patient might be likely to experience. It says seriously ill children should be given a greater say in whether they want to continue receiving treatment which is keeping them alive. The updated information provides three sets of circumstances for when limiting or withdrawing the treatment of children and babies can be considered. This can be done when life is limited in quality or when life is limited in quantity. Treatment can also be limited or withdrawn when there is 'competent refusal of treatment' - if an older child with extensive experience of illness repeatedly consents to stopping their medical care. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) advises doctors on when to treat children and babies with life-limiting and life-threatening illnesses. It says life-sustaining treatment can be limited or withdrawn when: . For example, a child that has undergone repeated cycles of chemotherapy or had organ transplantation, 'will have more informed views about continuing treatment than an adult facing such treatment for the first time', the document says. But it adds that, equally, children may not have any experience in decision making and it therefore may not be as appropriate for them to be involved. Written by medics, lawyers and ethicists, the framework was published to provide an ethical and legal framework for doctors. Since the last version was published 10 years ago, major breakthroughs in medical science have led to better survival rates for seriously sick babies and children. Babies born at 22 or 23 weeks are now surviving. But child health experts said that just because the technology is there, it does not mean it is necessarily in the child or baby's best interests to use it if their circumstances fall under any of the categories set out. Dr Simon Newell, a consultant neonatologist and vice president of the RCPCH, said the document sets out a 'better and more family-friendly process'. 'For some, continuing life-sustaining treatment is simply prolonging suffering in the face of the inevitable,' he said. Seriously ill children should be given a greater say in whether they want to continue treatment that is keeping them alive, the guidance adds (file photo) 'In these cases, an active decision is reached among the clinicians, parents and other parties to discontinue treatment rather than cause greater suffering for the child by keeping them alive.' The better informed the family or the patient themselves is, the better, he said, and more children and babies are receiving palliative care in hospices or at home rather than dying in hospital. Dr Joe Brierley, consultant in paediatric and neonatal intensive care at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) and chairman of the Ethics and Law Advisory Committee at the RCPCH, said: 'This is a sensitive and challenging area of medicine. 'The guiding principle remains to act in the best interest of the child, actively involving them in the decision making where possible, and of course considering the interests of the families and their rights. 'Decisions to limit treatments should be made by clinical teams in partnership with, and with the agreement of, the parents and child.'", "reference": "New guidance is from\u00a0the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health .\nAdvises on when to treat children and babies with life-limiting illnesses .\nSays medics should weigh up benefits of\u00a0treatment\u00a0versus child's suffering .\nAdds it is not always kind to save children and babies with no quality  of life .\nAdvises seriously ill children should help decide whether to stop their care ."}, "346": {"id": "6d6f70e1efd161e6a81ec52c517310d49ae0126b", "article": "Howard Webb has been promoted to a new role as performance director for England's professional referees and will be the man who selects officials for Premier League matches.

One of the most talented edge rushers in the upcoming draft, Gregory starred for Nebraska at outside linebacker for the past two seasons. 'I blame myself,' Gregory told NFL media's Kimberly Jones from his Atlanta home. 'And I know it sounds cliche, but there's really no one else I can blame.' The 22-year-old found out about the failed test a fortnight ago on the phone to his father. He had asked him to open an envelope which he mistakenly believed to be an invitation to the draft in Chicago. Randy Gregory impressed at the combine, running the 40 in 4.64 secs with a 125 inch broad jump . Gregory had 17.5 sacks in his two years at Nebraska and is one of the most coveted linebackers in the draft . Many experts have the 22-year-old as a top-five pick. At 6ft 5in he is versatile enough to rush the quarterback or operate in coverage, but in a class loaded with pass rushers, he spoke of his concerns. 'Am I worried? Yeah, I'm worried,' he said. 'At the same time, I'm confident. I know I'm going to be all right in the end.' Gregory told Jones that he hasn't smoked marijuana since December, and that he did not use other recreational drugs. 'I don't wake up every day saying, I'd really love to go smoke,' he said. 'It's not a struggle for me every day (now), it really isn't. In the past, hell yeah, it's been a struggle. It really has been.' Gregory's issues with the drug were well-documented. He failed two drug tests in January and April in 2014 at Nebraska. 'I was worse at Nebraska than I've ever been at any other time of my life. But I know how I am now. I think if teams really look at how I am now more so than the past, they'll see I'm making strides to get better, as a person and as a player,' he said. Despite the red flags, 29 NFL teams spoke to Gregory at the combine and if they did not know of his off-field issues, Gregory made them aware during the interviews. Gregory will enter the NFL in the first stage of the league's substance abuse programme. 'This incident right now is a step toward ending my career.

A fortnight ago the Chiefs saw off the Tigers in a thrilling LV= Cup semi-final and the teams met again at Welford Road in the Aviva Premiership, with the hosts hoping for a different outcome having lost just once in front of their own fans this season. And despite former Tiger Thomas Waldrom and Will Chudley going over for the Chiefs, the home side were celebrating as Burns kicked 20 points and Parling crossed the whitewash, with Leicester climbing above Exeter in the table in the process. Geoff Parling's second-half try helped Leicester Tigers beat Exeter Chiefs on Saturday . Parling (right) celebrates with team-mate Sebastian de Chaves following his try . Exeter had the first chance of the match from a penalty in the fourth minute when Leicester were caught offside with Henry Slade electing to kick from his own half with the wind behind him, however he put the chance wide. Barely three minutes later, Slade again missed a penalty after Leicester's Miles Benjamin had failed to move out of the way and the Tigers made them pay with Burns putting a penalty of their own away to give the Tigers the lead. With high balls causing havoc in the swirling wind and handling errors from Exeter, Burns then added a second penalty for Leicester on 18 minutes to double the home side's lead. Exeter finally got on the board in the 23nd minute with Slade this time successful with a kick from his own half. In the 36th minute the Tigers regained their six-point lead after Exeter failed to roll away after an excellent break from Benjamin, with Burns making no mistake again from the tee. It came at a price though with Benjamin leaving the field injured, replaced by Vereniki Goneva. The Tigers almost had the first try of the game on the stroke of half-time after another breakaway, but had to make do with a fourth penalty from Burns as Leicester went into the break with a 12-3 lead. Fly half Freddie Burns kicked six penalties for Leicester as they overcame Exeter . Exeter Chiefs' Thomas Waldrom scores a try against his former club . Exeter Chiefs' Will Chudley also scored a try but it was not enough to prevent his side from losing . It was the Tigers on the front foot from the start of the second half and with barely a minute gone they were awarded a penalty with Burns, in imperious form with the boot, slotting home his fifth penalty of the match to put Leicester further in front. Exeter swiftly made changes with the hope of getting back into the game with Ben Moon, Ben White and Tom James coming on. And it made the immediate impact as hoped with Waldrom scoring the first try of the game after an Exeter drive near the posts. Slade inexplicably missed the conversion, hitting the post when it seemed easier to score. It was the Tigers' turn to force the pressure with Goneva going close in the corner as both teams changed personnel. The pressure told as Leicester's dominance in the scrum saw Parling go over in the corner, with Burns adding the conversion to give the Tigers a 22-8 lead with a quarter of an hour remaining. Exeter hit straight back with a try of their own as Chudley went under the posts after a breakaway. Slade made no mistake this time to reduce the deficit to seven points with the Tigers still leading 22-15. Burns added a further penalty to increase the lead to 10 but missed his first kick of the game with just minutes remaining as he attempted one from his own half. A late Slade penalty was not enough for Exeter, however, as the Tigers saw out any further trouble to climb above their visitors in the table.", "reference": "Geoff Parling scores second half try for Leicester .\nFreddie Burns kicks six penalties for Tigers .\nThomas Waldrom and Will Chudley go over for Chiefs ."}, "350": {"id": "c9658fcd639ab670394bae00b93f74095a16e096", "article": "Islamic State fighters have been showing off their\u00a0embarrassingly\u00a0poor culinary skills on social media.

Destruction: The riot at the Rite of Passage Silver State Academy in rural Nevada at the weekend is the fourth uprising in four months at the school for at-risk teens. The 10 escapees have been recaptured . Six of the escapees were captured shortly after the riot that broke out about 8 p.m. Saturday, and the other four the next morning, he said. One building housing the laundry and another with a maintenance shop suffered an undetermined amount of fire damage. McNeil said he's increasingly concerned about the safety of the community and is pressing officials at the school to make changes so it doesn't happen again.

Police responding to a \u2018disturbance call\u2019 on Bahama Avenue confronted Ms Quincoces and informed her that her license had been suspended indefinitely February 9 and 'she was not to drive.' In the early hours of Sunday morning, the same deputy stopped Quincoces outside the Courtyard by Marriot Hotel in Key Largo and demanded to know why she was driving after being explicitly told not to get behind the wheel. The reality TV star was taken to the Plantation Key jail on a misdemeanor charge of driving with a suspended license and released just after 5am on her own recognizance. Quincoces starred on Season 2 of the Bravo reality TV show in 2012 and also made several appearances on the program in 2011 and 2013.

The American journeyman was handed a 15-year ban after being found to have taken several banned substances, including steroids, in out-of-competition tests carried out in December and January. The severity of the ban for the 29-year-old world No 267 owes itself to Odesnik already having been given a two-year ban when he was found in 2010 by Australian customs officials to be importing vials of human growth hormone at Melbourne Airport. American tennis player Wayne Odesnik has been banned for 15 years after a second doping violation . \u2018Goodbye Wayne \u2026 good riddance,\u2019 tweeted Murray, who has been among the more vociferous players calling for an extension of anti-doping measures in tennis. Andy Roddick joined in the condemnation of Odesnik who, even before 2010, was deeply unpopular in the locker room. He tweeted: \u2018My feelings are that he\u2019s a d*****bag and I hate that he has a US flag to his name when he\u2019s cheating, good riddance.\u2019 Veteran British doubles player Jamie Delgado chimed in: \u2018Wayne Odesnik cheats again, what a joke. Get out of the sport mate.\u2019 Murray later beat Adrian Mannarino 6-3, 6-3 at the BNP Paribas Open and will face Spain\u2019s Feliciano Lopez in the quarter-finals. It was Murray\u2019s 496th win, equalling Tim Henman\u2019s record for a British man in the Open Era. After his victory, Murray spoke further on Odesnik's ban. He told the BBC: 'I think it's a good thing for tennis that he's off the tour. Andy Murray tweeted 'bye bye Wayne... good riddance' before his win over Adrian Mannarino in Indian Wells . 'He was given a second chance in a way. He was a cheat so it is good for everyone involved in tennis that he's been dealt with in the right way. 'I think any doping in any sport is very bad. I think it's the job of the sports when cases do come up that they treat them very strictly and in the right way. 'I think [testing] is going in the right direction but I don't think it will ever be perfect.' Odesnik issued a statement maintaining his innocence, claiming he had accidentally ingested substances through taking an over-the-counter supplement, but he has little credit in the bank, especially after being linked to the notorious Biogenesis clinic in Florida two years ago. Tennis has stepped up its drug-testing regime and introduced a biological passport, but many still feel that a wealthy game should allocate more resources.

But the council was accused of committing \u2018a great act of folly\u2019 by The Save Sekhemka Statue Action group, who feared the ancient relic could disappear into private ownership overseas. Sold: The statue of Sekhemka (pictured at Christie's, London last year), a limestone figure which is just 30in high, was controversially sold by Northampton Borough Council for \u00a315.76million to a mystery buyer abroad . Now the culture minister Ed Vaizey has ordered a four-month export ban on the relic leaving the British Isles after Arts Council England ruled the sale breached standards for how museums manage their collections. That ban could even be extended to March 2016 if a \u2018serious intention to raise funds to purchase the statue is made\u2019, Arts Council England said.

Above, the artifact picture in Christie's last year . But in July last year the council sold off the piece, which they have owned for more than 100 years, insisting it wasn\u2019t the centrepiece of their collection. The Egyptian government called on the statue to be returned to Egypt if Northampton did not want it, and said the sale ran counter to the values and role of museums worldwide. A Northampton council spokesman said the export ban had \u2018no impact\u2019 on the council\u2019s sale of the statue \u2013 and insisted it was a matter for the government and Arts Council England to resolve between them. Tomb model: The statue of Sekhemka, on display at Christie's, London, ahead of its sale last year . The statue of Sekhemka was found during a 19th century archaeological dig near Cairo. The tomb model shows a seated man wearing a kilt and wig, with his wife, son and offering-bearers. Sekhemka was a high level scribe who lived in the Old Kingdom sometime between 2,700BC and 2,2250BC - the period of Egyptian history when the pyramids of Giza were built. In a country that was mainly illiterate, his ability to read and write means he would have been a person of high status with access to high offices. At first, tomb statues - a sign of wealth - were reserved for the royal family. But as the economy improved, officials like Sekhemka who held high-ranking positions could afford to pay craftsmen to create likenessess of themselves for their tomb. They served two purposes: to act as a record of the way the person looked, and to ensure that the offerings he desired for his survival in the afterlife - listed on the papyrus carried in the statue's hands - were made after his death. It is unkown exactly when the statue arrived at Northampton Museum, but records indicate it was on display before the end of the 1890s. It has been on display at various Norhampton museums until two years ago. The statue, which stands just 30in high, has been praised as a work of 'outstanding aesthetic importance' by culture minister Ed Vaizey. He added it was 'the finest example of any kind in the world'.

The adorable little girl may only be able to hear from her left ear but that doesn't doesn't stop her great love for music and dancing. But her mother, Tanya Byas, has been on a mission since her daughter was born with microtia to get to California for Autumn to have an operation because she can't have surgery in Australia until she is 10 years old - in seven years' time. Autumn Byas, from Bass Hill in southwest Sydney, was born without a right ear due to a\u00a0congenital deformity . Her mother, Tanya Byas (right), has been on a mission to get to California for her daughter to have an operation because Autumn can not have surgery in Australia for another seven years until she is 10-years-old . Autumn loves music despite being deaf in her right ear . The condition, that affects about one baby in every 8,000-10,000 births, is treated differently in Australia with medical professionals using rib cartilage from the 10 year-old patient to recreate the ear, which takes six months to recreate. However in America, the surgical technique uses a synthetic framework and the body\u2019s own tissue to create an ear during the eight-hour operation, meaing there are no age restrictions. 'They will use her good ear as a template and make it out of synthetic material but make it a bit bigger because ears only grow a little bit so when she grows up they will be even and they use her membrane skin to cover it,' Tanya explained. Autumn will also need a jaw reconstruction when she is about 12 or 13 years old. After scrimping, saving and fundraising, Tanya has booked her daughter in for the operation on June 2 but she is $20,000 short with just 10 weeks to go. Although Autumn is deaf in her right ear, she speaks well and has no other health complications but her mother's worst fear is that she will be tormented when she starts school in two year's time for looking different.

'She is so outgoing and free-spirited - it doesn't hold her back - she just goes about everyday life and I don't want that to change.' Paul Stanley from KISS was born with the same condition and was teased at school, and although it didn't stop the guitarist from succeeding in one of the most famous rock bands in the world, he still went ahead and had the reconstructive surgery in 1982 - almost a decade after the band formed. 'I read that he got called things like a \"one-eared freak\" when he was at school and I don't want Autumn to get called that,' she said. 'As much as I can teach her to be strong - it would still be tough.' Tanya's fear is that her daughter will be bullied when she starts school in another two years . A fundraiser is being held on Saturday to help with the last $20,000 needed for the $50,000 surgery . Life has been tough for Tanya, 39, who works full time as a sales coordinator, while her parents look after Autumn and has done without so she can put as much as she can towards her daughter's surgery. When Autumn was one-year-old, Tanya held a fundraiser dinner which raised $17,000 and she has managed to save $13,000 of her own money. She has also managed to pay for airfares and accommodation for the month-long trip. 'It's been hard because we can't do everyday things that people take for granted like going out to lunch or taking a trip,' she said. 'We went to the zoo last month but only because our friends had a free family pass.' But, Autumn still gets to do fun activities like any other kid such as swimming and dancing lessons which she relishes. The condition, Microtia, affects about one baby in every 8,000-10,000 births . With still $20,000 to go, Tanya is holding another fundraiser dinner this Saturday in the hope to raise the last of the funds for the surgery. 'I haven't even thought about what I will do if we don't raise the funds - I will have to get it from somewhere even if I get out a loan I guess,' she said. 'It will change Autumn's life immensely - it will give her a good start in life because no one will ever know.' 'She's such a performer so this will help her if she chooses that path in life.'

Six year old Kyle has developed an incredibly close bond with his canine companion Miracle . Miracle was snatched from the streets of north east Thailand and loaded onto a truck with hundreds of other stolen dogs, all\u00a0destined for the dog meat restaurants of Hanoi in Vietnam. Luckily for Miracle, the truck carrying him to his death was intercepted by agents working for the Phuket-based animal welfare charity Soi Dog Foundation. The dogs were taken to a purpose-built shelter in Thailand, where they were then put up for adoption. Amanda Leask spotted Miracle\u2019s photo shortly after he\u2019d been rescued on a Soi Dog Facebook post. Crossbreed Miracle (seen here hanging over the crowded pet cages) was destined for dog meat restaurants in Vietnam when he was saved by the\u00a0animal welfare charity Soi Dog Foundation . Devastated by his plight and the hopelessness of his situation, she enquired about adopting him. Already an owner of three rescue dogs from Soi Dog, Amanda very soon had her fourth. And while Miracle quickly got to work returning the favour to his new owner by creating a powerful bond with her son Kyle that transformed the young boy's life. Kyle was born with cerebral palsy, and was later diagnosed with autism. His condition means that it is incredibly difficult for him to communicate with his family. After learning that autistic people can develop extremely close relationships with canine pets, Amanda decided to adopt some dogs. Kyle and Miracle have since developed a close bond, which Amanda says reveals an unspoken mutual understanding. Amanda (pictured here with Miracle and Kyle) says there is an 'unspoken language' between the hound and her disabled son .

The good news is scientists have now discovered a way to reduce the calorie content by 60 per cent - simply by the way it is cooked. Cooking the rice with coconut oil, and then cooling it for 12 hours in the fridge, more than halved the number of calories in the rice when it was eaten. However, doctors have previously warned that eating reheated rice can cause food poisoning, and so advise making sure the rice is steaming hot all the way through before eating it. They also advise leaving the rice in the fridge no more than a day before reheating. Scroll down for video . Scientists have discovered that adding coconut oil to rice and cooling it in the fridge for 12 hours cuts the calorie content in half . The Sri Lankan researchers experimented with 38 kinds of rice from the country. Their recommended method of preparing the rice increases the amount of resistant starch inside it, which is indigestible to the human body. Therefore this resistant starch is not absorbed and turned into energy or fat, and has no calories. The scientists found a two-step process that was able to increase the amount of resistant starch in rice by 10 times. First, they added a teaspoon of coconut oil to boiling water, adding half a cup (105g) of rice, and then either simmering it for 40 minutes, or boiling it for 20 to 25 minutes. Then, they put the rice in the fridge for 12 hours to cool. Lead researcher Sudhair  James, of The College of Chemical Sciences, Sri Lanka, said if the best variety of rice is prepared using this method, 'it might reduce the calories by about 50-60 per cent.' He said the team wanted to find food-based solutions to the problem of obesity in developing countries, where rice is often a staple food. 'We discovered that increasing rice resistant starch (RS) concentrations was a novel way to approach the problem,' he said. The coconut oil enters the starch granules in the rice during its cooking, changing its architecture so it can no longer be digested, experts explained . A cup, or 210g of rice, contains around 240 calories. Mr James explained that starch can be digestible or indigestible. Rice is made of both of these types of starch. Unlike digestible types of starch, RS is not broken down in the small intestine, where carbohydrates are normally metabolized into glucose and other simple sugars and absorbed into the bloodstream. So, the researchers reasoned that if they could transform digestible starch into RS, then that could lower the number of calories of the rice. This is because the coconut oil enters the starch granules during cooking, changing its architecture so that it becomes resistant to the action of digestive enzymes, Mr James explained. This means that fewer calories ultimately get absorbed into the body. The cooling for 12 hours is essential, but reheating the rice for consumption does not affect the RS levels, he said. He added that the next step will be to complete studies with humans to learn which varieties of rice might be best suited to the calorie-reduction process. The team also will also experiment to see if other oils besides coconut have this effect. The research was presented at the 249th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS), the world's largest scientific society. Doctors warn reheated rice can cause food poisoning . Doctors warn that reheated rice can cause food poisoning. However, it's not the reheating that causes the problem but the way the rice has been stored before it was reheated. Uncooked rice can contain spores of Bacillus cereus, a bacterium that can cause food poisoning. When the rice is cooked, the spores can survive. If the rice is left standing at room temperature, the spores can grow into bacteria. These bacteria will multiply and may produce toxins that cause vomiting or diarrhoea. The longer cooked rice is left at room temperature, the more likely it is that the bacteria or toxins could make the rice unsafe to eat. How to serve rice safely: . \u00b7 ideally, serve rice as soon as it has been cooked . \u00b7 if that isn't possible, cool the rice as quickly as possible (ideally within one hour) \u00b7 keep rice in the fridge for no more than one day until reheating . \u00b7 when you reheat any rice, always check that the dish is steaming hot all the way through . \u00b7 do not reheat rice more than once .

The live-in girlfriend of an accused child molester from Indiana allegedly had helped the suspect arrange sexual encounters with young girls, according to recently unsealed court documents. Mark Speer, 44, a plumber from Lafayette, was arrested in August on suspicion of molesting a 3-year-old girl and creating child pornography videos. In the course of the investigation into the claims, police received permission to access Speer's private messages on Facebook and the dating site Zoosk exchanged between him and his girlfriend, Rebecca Kaster. Search warrants released last month state that Kaster had assisted her boyfriend in scheduling his illicit encounters with children. One Facebook message sent from Kaster's account to Speer December 22, 2013, read: 'i think i have the best chance getting her or the younger [girl]...so far that\u2019s all i got.' Speer reportedly replied that Kaster's update turned him on. Kaster, who has not been charged with any crime, told detectives that she and Speer had an open relationship, in which he was allowed to have sex with other women he met online, according to the court documents cited by Indianapolis Star. Speer was charged last September with child molesting, attempted child molesting and criminal confinement, along with federal child pornography charges, .

'We are not proponents of anti-police (attitudes)... We understand that law enforcement is necessary and mandatory and we need to change our mindset about the police,' Carter said at a news conference outside the house where Robinson was shot.

Short, wrote to the judge that Robinson had taken special-education classes and had never been in trouble with the law before. Studensts and some adults stood arm-in-arm as they made their way down the streets . 'He was an easy choice for the seasoned co-defendants to manipulate into participation,' Short wrote. 'He did not give any orders but just followed the instructions meted out by the other defendants.' Keith Wessel, a Madison family law attorney who said he was married to Robinson's grandmother for a time, wrote to Short in September and told him that he raised two of Robinson's uncles and knew Robinson from birth. Wessel wrote that some branches of Robinson's family exposed him to a 'chaotic environment.' He did not elaborate but said Robinson faced a choice between a middle-class life and the 'gangsta' path. He warned if Robinson went to prison on a felony charge he would continue toward the gangster world. He said Monday he was shocked at the shooting. He said Robinson stood 6-foot-5 but was a 'teddy bear.' Remembrance: A memorial for the teenager was set up outside the apartment where he was shot.

The din of what is the closest he can get to a home-town crowd was still ringing in his ears as he considered the implications of a 3-2 victory over America - one that has again put Leon Smith\u2019s squad into the last eight of the sport\u2019s premier team competition. Wimbledon\u2019s host nation may not be able to raise a quorum when it comes to volume of players in the world\u2019s top 100, but where there is Murray, there is hope. Andy Murray celebrates as his win over John Isner leads Great Britain into the Davis Cup's last eight . Murray celebrates during his straight sets win over Isner that clinched the Brits a quarter-final place . Murray produced the right results in points at key moments to overcome the fancied American . He showed that again as he held off a ferocious challenge from 6ft 10in John Isner to win 7-6, 6-3, 7-6 and push Britain into a July quarter-final against France. Yet he was cautious about whether that could actually lead to GB winning the Davis Cup for the first time since 1936. \u2018To win the event is an extremely difficult thing to do,\u2019 he said. \u2018Even with someone like Federer, such a great player, it\u2019s taken him to have a top five in the world partner (Stan Wawrinka) to help him to do that. We\u2019re playing at the limits of our level right now.\u2019 If he was merely being realistic there was not, after all, a great deal of time for heady celebration. Such are the demands of the tour that he was flying back to London on Sunday night and then flying on Monday morning to Los Angeles for the season\u2019s first Masters level event at Indian Wells. Accompanying him will be James Ward, without whom none of this weekend\u2019s triumph would have been possible. Murray was the star but this was truly an Anglo-Scottish enterprise at a time when such things are under threat. James Ward turned the tie in Great Britain's favour with his own victory over Isner on Friday . Ward took the first two sets in the dead rubber against\u00a0Donald Young but retired to protect his knee . Ward\u2019s Friday night epic against Isner turned this match in the home side\u2019s favour - just as he had 13 months ago in the corresponding first-round match against America, when he defeated Sam Querrey. The 28-year-old Londoner is one of those players who grows an extra three inches in the team environment, but it is expecting a lot of a player outside the world\u2019s top 100 to keep the upsets coming. Ward even took the first set against Donald Young in the dead rubber after Murray\u2019s victory on Sunday but then conceded the match to protect his sore knee. When asked about his side\u2019s potential, Smith said: \u2018We have still got a bit of work to do but we are getting closer. We can trouble most teams. You\u2019ve seen the spirit we have.\u2019 The victorious Great Britain team smile with clenched fists after their 3-2 win over the United States . The Brits gather on the court after their win which sets up a clash with France in the quarter-finals . This was another triumph for Smith. In an era when big-name ex-players are all the rage as coaches, he continues to land blows for the lower-profile professional. For the second consecutive time he has got the better of former world No 1 Jim Courier in the captain\u2019s chair. Murray is not only among the planet\u2019s best tennis players, he has also shown what a team man he is this weekend with his passionate support from the sidelines. If there is a worry, it is that it may all have sapped him. It helped that the 7,700 capacity crowd was intent on dragging him over the line. No wonder the debate over the next month will be whether the advantage of grass in the next round is outweighed by the passion of playing in Scotland on a hard court. Murray, embracing GB team captain Leon Smith, praised the 'effort and attitude of everyone in the team' Great Britain captain Smith celebrate as their talisman Murray wins a crucial point against World No 20 Isner . Murray said: \u2018I knew that James was extremely tired and I knew it would be a very tough ask for him to come out and win that match (yesterday\u2019s final singles) after me. There is pressure to help your team-mates out and I wanted to try and finish the tie there. \u2018I was very emotional all weekend \u2014 it is quite draining. I was proud of the team, the way they performed and fought in this arena under so much pressure.\u2019 Isner was desperate to make amends for Friday and had come out swinging in the first set against Murray, backing up his enormous serve with early strikes in rallies designed to prevent any long exchanges. He forced seven break points en route to the tiebreak including three set points at 5-4, which saw him taking huge cuts at Murray\u2019s more vulnerable second serve. What it came down to was Murray\u2019s greater sangfroid in the tiebreak, which Isner began with a double fault. That first set settled the nerves of Murray and the crowd and he broke for 4-2 in the second with an exquisite lob \u2014 no mean feat against a giraffe-like opponent. To Isner\u2019s credit, he kept fighting. But the second tiebreak followed much the same pattern as the first and was sealed 7-4 with a swinging ace which met with a cacophony that nearly blew the roof off. It was the kind of supreme effort from Murray that is all too easily taken for granted. Big American Isner fell to Murray after\u00a0James Ward come from two sets down to beat him in an epic tussle .

Which is why locals refer to this region of lakes, castles, and beaches in the North-east of Germany as MV, or Meck-Pom. The Pom refers to Pomerania, now mostly in Poland. It has a long coastline on the Baltic and is the third largest of Germany's 16 Laender - but the least populated. So you can walk for miles on a sandy strand or drive all day on the autobahn and not see a sausage, except in your lunch. Back in focus: 'Meck-Pom' offers blissful beaches along Germany's Baltic Sea coastline . After World War II, Meck-Pom was part of Communist East Germany, which might account for its low profile. The regime concentrated on the cities and neglected the countryside, so castles and seaside resorts deteriorated. Since reunification 25 years ago, all that has changed. The result is a clutch of wonderful hotels and beautifully-run resorts. The sea accounts for the region's ancient wealth and the cities along the coast - Wismar, Rostock, Stralsund and Greifswald - were part of the 13th-century trading confederation, the Hanseatic League, which did business with Scandinavians and Slavs around the Baltic. Two of the cities, Wismar and Stralsund, are World Heritage Sites. Towering medieval cathedrals and customs houses on market squares as big as football pitches are built of ancient revolutionary red-brick, moulded and baked from the sodden clay. The harbour has bars, cafes and shops for windsurfers, anglers and bucket-and-spaders. On the road, go-kart tracks and wildlife parks fill gaps between the farms and forests. A day's fishing off a boat costs \u20ac39 (\u00a327), including lunch from a stewpot. At the beach resorts of Boltenhagen and Warnemunde, holidaymakers on hire bikes (\u00a36.50 a day) pedal through pine-filled parks to the sea-front. A steam train called Molli plies a coastal route to Heiligendamm, location of the five-star Grand Hotel. It has a sanatorium, a Michelin-star chef, a castle (for weddings) and a children's house with games. Quietly charming: The pretty Alte Markt square in Stralsund sums up the region's appeal . Meck-Pom is a refuge in peace and war. Forewarned of the Allied bombing, citizens of Hamburg, Berlin and Dresden fled here. 'The castles were full of refugees,' says Freiherr Helmuth von Maltzahn, proprietor of 16th-century Schloss Ulrichshusen, which his ancestor Ulrich built among the inland lakes. Helmuth, born in 1949, bought back his burnt-out family home and turned it into a 40-room hotel. At sunset, cranes fly over the lakes in their thousands in what looks, for a moment, like an intricate, interweaving MV-formation.

Charles Dickens is today venerated as one of England's greatest ever literary heroes - but he was not always treated with such respect. Newly rediscovered records reveal that at the height of his fame, the celebrated novelist was targeted by thugs who tried to overturn his carriage on his journey home. Dickens also had hay stolen from his home at Gad's Hill Place near Rochester in Kent, and complained about rubbish from the local pub being thrown into his garden. His struggles with the neighbours came to light in a series of newspaper cuttings from the British Newspaper Archive which have been unearthed by Bygone Kent magazine. The author moved into Gad's Hill in 1856, using the money he had earned from novels such as Oliver Twist, A Chrismas Carol and David Copperfield. He used to take the train from London to Higham, the nearest station to his home, before getting in a horse-drawn carriage to take him the rest of the way. But in June 1862, his regular route almost got him in trouble - as reported by local paper the South Eastern Gazette, which wrote about a 'diabolical attempt to overturn Mr C. Dickens' carriage' by farm worker James Stedman. Dickens was supposed to arrive at Higham at 10.30pm to be met by his groom, James Marsh, but he missed the train and the groom returned to Gad's Hill. The newspaper reported: 'A little distance on he found two rollers lying across the road, which, had they not been perceived in time, would have caused serious mischief. 'James Munn, a fellow workman of the prisoner, had accompanied Stedman from Strood to Higham by the 9.30, and when passing through the village saw Mr Dickens' carriage drive down to the station. 'The prisoner immediately afterwards went into a field and drew the two rollers across the road to upset the carriage on its return. Munn at the time held the gate open for the prisoner.' Transport: Dickens pictured in a horse-drawn carriage with his wife and daughters . Home: Dickens moved in to Gad's Hill Place, near Rochester in Kent, in 1856 . After the incident, Stedman sought refuge in a pub across the road from Dickens' home, where he played skittle - but was soon caught by the police. He was charged at Rochester Magistrates' Court with 'placing a horse-roller, and also a hand roller, on the middle of the turnpike road, at a late hour on Saturday night, with the intention of upsetting the carriage of Mr C. Dickens, which was returning from the Higham railway station'. Stedman pleaded drunkenness as his excuse, but a month later it emerged that he had done the same thing on a different road in a bid to overturn someone else's carriage, and he was sentenced to two months' hard labour. In 1859, George Blackman was jailed for three days after he stole hay from Dickens' home, which was one of the grandest in the area. Rubbish dumping was also a concern for Dickens, as in 1858 he was forced to write to a local pub landlord who continuously left his property a mess. Family: Dickens reads to his daughters in the grounds of the home, which he bought at the height of his fame . Dickens wrote: 'Mr Charles Dickens begs Mr Strood to be so good as to give directions that no rubbish or refuse from the Falstaff to be thrown into the shrubbery of Gad's Hill Place. 'Mr Dickens also hopes that Mr Strood will advise his customers not to trespass on that ground, in going from the Falstaff to the village. 'He wishes very earnestly to live on good terms with his neighbours of all degrees and he hopes that they know it, and will not fee disinclined to respect his property. 'He is sure that Mr Strood can have no desire not to do what is obliging and right, he therefore addresses this note to Mr Strood in good will and good humour.' Station: The railway station at Higham, near Gad's Hill, where Dickens would get the train from London . Trouble: Dickens wrote a letter to the landlord of the Falstaff pub complaining about litter . It was reported on another occasion that Dickens was forced to add a padlock to his cellar after locals broke in and stole champagne for a party. The author died at Gad's Hill in 1870, at the age of 58. The home is now a private school. Andrew Rootes, editor of Bygone Kent, said: 'I was brought up in the village of Higham, near where Dickens lived, and have always been an admirer, so was delighted to alight upon this incident tucked away in the British Newspaper Archive. 'Stedman was a fairly hopeless type of criminal, nowhere as impressive as the list of malefactors in Dickens's novels, but worthy of a minor role.'", "reference": "The great novelist was the subject of an attempted highway robbery in 1862 when a criminal tried to overturn his carriage .\nDickens escaped harm because he had missed the train he usually took .\nRecords unearthed from the British Newspaper Archive show that the author complained about noise next to his home, Gad's Hill Place .\nA local man was jailed for stealing hay from Dickens' house ."}, "375": {"id": "d58368888fd9fab22af5ad231b7b054f24f6942b", "article": "Racing experts Peter Scudamore and Sam Turner review the best of the action from Ladies Day at the Cheltenham Festival.

A cancer charity warns that despite an NHS ban, the controversial end-of-life programme is still in use under \u2018a different name\u2019. The report comes as police are investigating the death of a second \u2018healthy\u2019 pensioner at a hospital in Cheshire. The family of Margaret \u2018Nellie\u2019 Smart, 93, lodged a formal complaint against Warrington and Halton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, saying they were convinced the mother of 12 died after being dehydrated. A new report has warned that hospitals are still using the discredited treatment method, file photograph . Nurses told MPs that some hospitals have merely \u2018tweaked\u2019 the end-of-life protocol and given it another title \u2013 meaning the \u2018abuse\u2019 suffered by some frail and vulnerable patients under the Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP) may still be happening. The Royal College of Nursing said its members had \u2018not seen a significant difference\u2019 in the way care is delivered in England since the pathway was withdrawn last year. In a report out tomorrow, MPs on the Commons Health Select Committee are set to urge hospitals to review their procedures to ensure the LCP is not used. They are expected to say that, in far too many cases, it is unclear whether proper discussions have been held with patients and their families. They are also set to call for social care for the terminally ill to be free, to ensure people are not forced to suffer bad deaths because of money worries. An initial police inquiry into the death of an elderly patient has now been expanded after Mrs Smart\u2019s family complained about alleged neglect at the same hospital. She died after the NHS ban on the controversial pathway was imposed. Her family believe that the great-grandmother would still be alive if she had not been admitted to Warrington General Hospital for checks following a suspected minor stroke. The Liverpool Care Pathway sees patients sedated, denied food and water and then allowed to die . The Mail uncovered the cruel 'Death Pathway' on July 16, 2013 . The trust is already being investigated after Angela Johnson, the daughter of 85-year-old Alice Johnson who died on the LCP shortly before its abolition, made an almost identical complaint weeks earlier. The LCP involves the withdrawal of life-saving treatment. Patients are sedated and most are denied food and fluids. They typically die within 29 hours. Critics said it was a way of hastening death, and \u2013 following pressure from the Daily Mail \u2013 it was phased out following the Neuberger review two years ago, which found some patients were so dehydrated they were forced to suck on hospital sponges. No hospital was meant to be using the pathway from summer last year. They were instead given a set of five care \u2018priorities\u2019 by the Department of Health. But in written evidence to the Commons inquiry, the charity Macmillan Cancer Support said: \u2018Some areas have worked well to develop [new] guidance ... other areas, however, are still using the Liverpool Care Pathway by a different name.\u2019 Labour MP Rosie Cooper said that if the pathway was still in use, how can we know whether the \u2018abuses, misunderstandings and lack of education isn\u2019t going on under our noses now?\u2019 Macmillan told the MPs too many doctors and nurses do not know how to talk to patients and their families about death.", "reference": "A cancer charity claims the NHS is using a controversial 'Death Pathway'\nPatients are being sedated and then refused food and water until death .\nStudies show that patients on the death pathway last on average 29 hours ."}, "377": {"id": "03c3e8117a003f699fe8a5849bf0c759b340bef3", "article": "Who says cats hate water? Jaguar this week launched its new, second-generation XF compact sports saloon with a high-wire drive over water on cables just an inch thick. In a stunt worthy of the latest Bond film Spectre \u2014 for which the firm is supplying many of the cars \u2014 the XF was revealed in a dramatic stunt in the heart of London's Docklands. High over the Royal Dock in Canary Wharf, stuntman Jim Dowdell \u2014 a veteran of the Bond, Bourne and Indiana Jones films \u2014 drove the car 240 metres across wires to demonstrate the car's lightweight aluminium construction and agility. Don't look down! Jaguar's new XF seen crossing London's Royal Dock by high wire this week . Excitement aside, Jaguar's XF sport saloon promises 'business class' levels of comfort and refinement with a new generation of frugal engines. It's being built at Jaguar Land Rover's Castle Bromwich factory in Birmingham alongside the allaluminium F-Type sports car and top-of-the-range XJ limousine. Its official global debut is at the New York motor show on April 1 before going on sale in the autumn from \u00a330,000 to \u00a380,000. Jaguar's XF sport saloon (pictured) promises 'business class' levels of comfort and refinement with a new generation of frugal engines . The new version is 80kg lighter than its closest competitor. This helps it return more than 70 mpg with CO2 emissions of 104g/km. Engines include 163bhp and 180bhp 2-litre Ingenium diesels linked to six-speed manual and eight-speed automatic gearboxes. The manual 163bhp diesel is 'the lightest, most efficient non-hybrid diesel model in its market segment,' says Jaguar. All other engines are eightspeed automatics. There is also a powerful 3-litre 300bhp V6 twinturbo diesel and a 3-litre 380 bhp V6 supercharged petrol engine. The proportions have also been tweaked. While 7mm shorter and 3mm lower than its predecessor, its wheelbase is 51mm longer, meaning more back seat space, legroom and headroom. Jaguar is investing \u00a3600 million in its manufacturing capacity in Britain, \u00a3400million at its Castle Bromwich plant. Great to see Britain's former 'Motown' \u2014 Coventry, once the capital of our motor industry \u2014 getting some bumper good news this week. The city that for decades has built the iconic London taxi is to gain a new factory, costing \u00a3250million, creating up to 1,000 jobs and building up to 36,000 vehicles a year. Chinese motor giant Geely , which bought the UK firm outright two years ago after holding a stake since 2006, said the state-of the-art research, development and assembly plant for the London Taxi Company will be built in the city of Lady Godiva (and Peeping Tom). It is a tenfold increase on the company's site, which has been home to London taxis for 70 years and heralds the introduction of the next generation electric and ultralow emission London black cab. Coventry's links with China go back a long way after it had the foresight in the early Eighties to twin itself with the Chinese city of Jinan in Shandong province. What the two cities had in common was silk: Jinan is at the end of the Silk Road and Coventry \u2014 before the rise of the motor industry \u2014 was a centre for the finest silk-working. The Chinese think long-term and have an important concept called guanxi \u2014 or social connections \u2014 which help smooth business. Coventry was early to establish these vital connections.

Struggling to keep his emotions in check John Bilardi told 60 Minutes that it was clear his son suffered from psychological problems from an early age, but that they were never properly addressed, despite the fact all the warning signs were there. 'I would just like everyone to know that the buck stops here with me. He was my son. I knew there was something not right with his behaviour,' he said. Scroll down for videos .

I feel totally responsible for that. 'I should have been there for him. He obviously needed help, and as a parent I wasn't able to do that.' Jake was prone to random acts of aggression and on one particular occasion he attacked his father with a pair of scissors. 'The worse times were when he'd arm himself with a weapon and threaten you with a weapon,' Mr Bilardi said. More terrifying was that Jake was stock piling chemicals to build bombs that were to be detonated in Australia. 'It's hard to process this. But that wasn't him. He was just a shy, lonely young man,' Mr Bilardi said. 'How he got to this I cannot even start to try and explain. Only he knows... He had a death wish.' He is still coming to terms with his son's decision, to run away from their Melbourne home and join Islamic State, a move which ultimately cost him his life, at age 18. 'To see him sitting there with that gun... I just couldn't believe that was my son,' Mr Bilardi said about the now infamous photograph of his son with ISIS members. 'They put him in a car loaded with explosives. They probably just shouted 'praise Allah' or whatever, and sent him off. I can't imagine what he was feeling.' He poured his heart out in the interview about his late son. The teenager is believed to have converted to Islam in 2012 when he was in Year 10, shortly after his mother died of cancer.

He recounts his son's final message, sent from the ISIS bunker to his father, as he was convinced to take his own life. It was: 'Hi Dad, I am very happy to be here'. Jake's radicalisation took place in the privacy of his own home where he went online to develop ties with ISIS. And Mr Bilardi issued a chilling warning to other parents about the lure of terrorists to defenceless young Australians. 'This is a big warning. It's going on, it's real.' His revelations coming, as an Islamic State propaganda website, geared towards celebrating the sacrifice made by the Melbourne teenage jihadi, did anything but glorify the actions of the 18-year-old suicide bomber.

The attack was a failure. Iraqi military official, General Tahssin Ibrahim, said no one was killed and just a few vehicles were damaged in Bilardi's suicide mission. The extremist site sought to praise Bilardi but delivers backhanded comments describing his weakness and ultimately the futility of his sacrifice. \u2018He started fighting in Baij\u012b against the ISF R\u0101fidha and was a lion on the battlefield although he was at a young age and with a weak body, he was like a mountain,\u2019 the post, on a tumblr blog site associated with the Islamic extremist group, said. It goes on to say that Bilardi volunteered for a 'martyrdom operation' - code words for a suicide bombing - and that he was eager to carry out the mission. Earlier social media posts suggested Bilardi had wanted to take part in a suicide bombing in Baiji in Iraq, but that he pulled out of this mission because he got cold feet. Instead he fought in the city before again signing up for martrydom and being sent to Ramadi in Iraq. The post said Bilardi was 'full of happiness as he was finally going to meet his Lord and receive the great rewards promised by Him.' But it goes on to mock his sacrifice. 'This brother originated from an atheist family & ended up selling his soul to Allah for a cheap price,' the post says. Jake Bilardi (left) in a school photo from Year 10 - the year he converted to Islam according to school friends, and another image of him wearing a Chelsea Football Club shirt (right) An image of Bilardi sitting in front of an Islamic State flag was posted to Twitter, ahead of his suicide mission in Iraq, which authorities labelled 'a failure' The post said that during his time in Ramadi, Bilardi was very devout 'known for his worship of Allah' and would fast every other day. It said Bilardi accepted Islam three years ago \u2018even though his parents basically went to war with him at home tried to stop him from reverting\u2019. 'Happy-slapped': Jake Bilardi was bullied while at high school in Craigieburn Secondary College in Melbourne's north, and video emerged of the incident ahead of his suicide mission for Islamic State . The bullying tactic sees a group of people slap their victim and film it on a camera phone before uploading it on-line in order to humiliate them. Here Jake Bilardi is 'happy slapped' while at school . The former Craigieburn Secondary College student, converted to Islam in 2012 when he was in Year 10. A video later surfaced from his school days which shows Bilardi being 'happy slapped' - a bullying tactic which sees a group of people slap their victim, film it and upload it on-line to humiliate them. In December, Bilardi reached Ramadi, a city located in central Iraq, and said he 'made hijra (or departed)\u2019 in August. He was considered a well-educated maths genius, who dreamed of one day becoming a political journalist and even founded a children\u2019s soccer charity but by the time he\u2019d reached his 18th birthday Jake Bilardi\u2019s mind had been warped. If you believe his tale of events - detailed in an articulate blog called From Melbourne to Ramadi: My Journey - Bilardi joined Islamic State fighters in Iraq after years of historical research and a final realisation that 'I was growing tired of the corruption and filthiness of Australian society and yearned to live under the Islamic State with the Muslims'. However, the picture Bilardi paints of himself \u2013 a scholar and a rational thinker \u2013 is very different to the lonely outcast that his former classmates at Craigieburn Secondary College have described. \u2018At school he was a \"loner\". He only really had two or three friends from memory but they weren't the type of friends that if he was in need of some help were good at helping,\u2019 a former classmate told Daily Mail Australia. \u2018He was obviously a kid that needed some help or guidance and he thought converting to Muslim was right for him,\u2019 they opined. Another classmate, after hearing that Bilardi may be dead, described him as not 'capable of punching his way out of a wet paper bag. He was fragile'.

At a proceeds of crime hearing Mason, a contract worker, was told failure to pay will result in a default sentence of 12 months in prison. Detective Constable David Williams, a financial investigator said: 'This sentence sends a clear message to anyone thinking of trying to evade payment of train fares and parking that it really isn't worth it.' A search of the fraudster's home revealed a sophisticated  set-up to make the fake train travel and parking tickets, including a software package which allowed him to design the counterfeit tickets (pictured) After raiding Mason's home, police found fake and genuine tickets, glossy photographic paper,  printers, as well as craft knives, scissors and a cutting board, which were all used in the ticket-making process . Mason, of Hatfield, Doncaster, in South Yorkshire, was sentenced to six months in prison suspended for two years. He has also been ordered to carry out 240 hours unpaid work and a 12-day restorative justice course at Sheffield Crown Court. The British Transport Police investigation began in autumn 2013 when East Coast Trains station support staff saw Mason's black Vauxhall Meriva car on several occasions in the Executive Car Park at Doncaster train station. Various ticket discrepancies were noted including an expired ticket and tickets with wrong colours, no date and time printed, incorrect emblems and incorrect value paid. Replicating the real tickets, Mason used  software to change the details on the ticket in order to get free travel. He included the type of ticket, the date, the price, the journey and the printing date (pictured) But inspectors noticed various ticket discrepancies, including an expired ticket and tickets with wrong colours, no date and time printed, incorrect emblems and incorrect value paid .

BTP was informed and in December an officer spotted the car and approached Mason when he returned to his vehicle later that day. He was arrested on suspicion of fraud offences and a search of the car revealed 10 further tickets believed to have been forged. Forensic examination of the computer devices found at his home revealed Mason had used the computers to produce forged travel and parking tickets. The offences were committed between March 24, 2011, and December 19, 2013.

Michelle Wilkins, 26, was seven-months pregnant when she responded to a Craigslist ad for maternity clothes in Longmont, Colorado last week. She was stabbed and had her fetus ripped out allegedly by 34-year-old Dynel Lane. Miss Wilkins had been treated at\u00a0Longmont United Hospital. In a statement, her family said: 'Today marks a week since the brutal attack that nearly cost Michelle her life and ended that of her soon to be born baby Aurora. 'She is now out of the hospital in a safe location and accompanied by her partner Dan, is taking the first tentative steps along a long journey towards recovery and spiritual reconciliation. Scroll down for video . Michelle Wilkins, 26, was seven months pregnant when she was stabbed and had her baby removed by a female attacker in Longmont, Colorado. She was released from hospital on Wednesday . A GoFundMe account has been set up for the 26-year-old and raised close to $47,000 from well-wishers. Her family expressed their gratitude on Wednesday . 'She is surrounded by friends and family and wishes to express her deep gratitude for all the expressions of love, kindness, and spiritual solidarity she has received from both the Longmont community and from around the world. 'Michelle believes her recovery is directly aided by the prayers and positive energy she is receiving. The statement continued: 'We cannot predict what lies ahead for Michelle. We have no guidebook on how to navigate this crisis, or a checklist on what to do next. We wish there were. 'What we can say is that we have all been deeply moved by the many people who have reached out to Michelle and her partner to share their own personal stories of tragedies they\u2019ve endured and how they managed to first just survive and then eventually start to heal. That alone has given us the strength to get up and face each day. The 26-year-old was surrounded by family who confirmed she had now left hospital. They said she was drawing comfort from her beloved dog, Jade, who had not left her side . 'You\u2019ve touched our hearts and souls and we thank you so much.' A\u00a0GoFundMe\u00a0page has raised close to $47,000 for the 26-year-old. The family wrote on the fundraising page that Miss Wilkins was also being comforted by her 'beloved dog Jade'. The 26-year-old had moved to Colorado and just started a job teaching pottery classes. On March 18, she answered a Craigslist ad for baby clothes in a suburban neighborhood of Longmont, about 30 miles from Denver. She was glassed in the neck and then attacked with a small knife in the basement, allegedly by Dynel Lane. The suspect then fled with the baby, who was found by Lane's husband, taking her last breath's in the bathtub. Lane reportedly told her husband that she had suffered a miscarriage and he took her to hospital with the baby. The accused attacker told hospital staff she had suffered a miscarriage but later admitted her atrocious deed. Around 2.30pm, Miss Wilkins managed to make a 911 call as she lay bleeding out on the basement floor. During the desperate six-minute call, she faintly told the dispatcher: 'She cut me in the stomach... I'm pregnant... I'm bleeding out.' The police officers who found her, Billy Sawyer and Phil Piotrowski, described finding Wilkins weak and in a state of shock. 'I started yelling and Michelle yelled back, very faintly, and it was muffled \u2014 \"Help me! Help me!\"' Sawyer told\u00a0KTLA\u00a0this weekend. He described finding her covered from head to toe in blood. 'So I put some gloves on and held her hand and went through where her injuries were \u2026 trying to figure out exactly what we had,' he said. Piotrowski believed that Miss Wilkins was the one who 'saved her own life.' 'She is probably one of the strongest people I've ever had the pleasure to meet,' he said. The situation was so bad that he had to leave the room for a moment to compose himself. The 26-year-old was released from Longmont United Hospital on Wednesday. 'She is taking the first tentative steps along a long journey towards recovery and spiritual reconciliation,' her family said . Last Friday, a member of hospital staff told Daily Mail Online how Wilkins did not realize she had lost her baby and still believed she was carrying her child. Abby Johnson, 18, an intern at the hospital, said the horrified woman, who had blood pouring from her stomach, pleaded for help and was concerned about the safety of the baby which had been due this spring. Miss Johnson, speaking through her friend Gary Brennan, said Miss Wilkins was in 'a terrible state with her guts hanging out. She had been bleeding really badly'. The victim's cousin told\u00a0ABC11 that the baby was Miss Wilkin's first child and would have been her parents' first grandchild. Suspect, Dynel Lane, 34, was arrested presenting the abducted child as her own in hospital, and was facing charges of first-degree attempted murder, assault and child abuse. She been remanded in Boulder County Jail on $2 million bail. Dynel Catrece Lane, 34, (pictured with her husband, David Ridley) was facing murder charges in Colorado after she allegedly cut a baby from the womb of a seven months' pregnant woman who she lured to her home with a Craigslist ad for baby clothes . Police were \u00a0investigating whether Lane knocked Wilkins her unconscious and then removed the fetus by cutting open her abdomen. Wilkins arrived at the home shortly before midday to buy baby clothes which had been advertised. She was also stabbed in the neck with a broken glass before being cut open. Lane, who has two daughters, was held on $2million bail during a hearing at Boulder County Jail, Colorado (pictured in booking photo) In Longmont this week, protesters took to the streets of the city, which has a population of 90,000, to pressure police into charging the suspect with murder. The demonstrator's held placards with messages such as 'Murder is murder' and 'Justice for Michelle'. Among then were several pregnant women who got together to join the demonstration through social media. Katelyn Dunn, 26, said: 'We feel so sorry for Michelle. She had carried her child for seven months and must have been so excited about the future as a mother. 'It is a very special thing to have a child and this is such an appalling thing to happen. We feel so much for her and want the attacker to be accused of murder and nothing less.' Murder charges against Lane now depend on whether the child was alive outside of the 26-year-old expectant mother's womb, the district attorney's office said last week. Boulder County District Attorney Stanley L. Garnett said: 'The issue of whether or not murder charges are appropriate involving a case involving the death of a fetus or a late-term pregnancy is always a difficult issue. 'Under Colorado law, essentially, there's no way murder charges can be brought if it's not established that the fetus lived as a child outside the body of the mother for some period of time.

Brendan Rodgers' in-form Reds survived a first-half fright at Swansea on Monday night before emerging 1-0 winners to cut the gap on fourth-placed United to two points. Mignolet had to produce fine stops to deny Bafetimbi Gomis and Gylfi Sigurdsson in a first half Swansea dominated but Jordan Henderson's fortunate winner gave Liverpool their fifth successive Barclays Premier League victory. Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet punches a cross clear during his side's 1-0 win against Swansea . Captain Steven Gerrard congratulates Mignolet after the Reds' fifth successive Premier League victory . 'We showed the character and resilience during the game that you need if you're going to be successful,' Mignolet said. 'This was our sixth successive clean sheet away from home and we have to keep that going until the end of the season. 'You keep those clean sheets as a whole team. Everyone is playing together, doing their job and willing to fight for each other.' Liverpool have not lost in the league since a 3-0 defeat at United on December 14 when the stuttering Mignolet was dropped and replaced by Brad Jones. But Mignolet soon reclaimed his place and both he and Liverpool have gone from strength to strength ever since, the Merseysiders now unbeaten in 13 league games and Rodgers insisting they can catch second-placed Manchester City who are currently four points better off than his men. United's visit on Sunday might go a long way to determining if that ambition is feasible but Mignolet insists Liverpool have to focus solely on themselves and not their rivals for a top-four spot. Liverpool's players celebrate after Jordan Henderson's decisive second half goal at the Liberty Stadium . Mignolet pulls off an acrobatic save to deny Swansea midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson a goal . 'This win sets up the next game and that's a big game of course,' Mignolet said. 'But we don't have to make too much of it, there's three points there and we have to try to do our best to get the win at home. 'We just have to look at our own performances, there's no point in looking at the other teams, and keep doing what we've been doing in the last few months. 'We've still got all the big teams to play but the important thing is we don't look too forward ahead of ourselves.' Mignolet does not resemble the goalkeeper who visibly appeared anxious and made regular mistakes during the first half of the season. As well as his precious first-half saves at the Liberty Stadium he was commanding in the air and punched well under pressure, but he puts his impressive record down to those in front of him. 'As a goalkeeper you're depending on the rest of the team to keep those clean sheets,' he said. 'You can't do that on your own and that's what's pleasing. Henderson scores the only goal of the game as the ball cannons off his shin fortuitously . The England midfielder celebrates in front of Liverpool's travelling contingent at the Liberty Stadium . 'Everybody's doing their job, is organised and that makes life easy for a goalkeeper. 'We had to fight at Swansea to get through to 0-0 at half-time but the second half we got the goal and that came with putting a lot more pressure on the ball.' Swansea defender Jordi Amat felt Garry Monk's side paid the price for failing to turn their first-half superiority into a lead. The Spaniard played an unwitting role in Henderson's winner as his attempted clearance clattered off the Liverpool midfielder and flew over Lukasz Fabianski in the Swansea goal. 'It was an unlucky goal for us,' said Amat, who was making his first league start since September after Federico Fernandez had returned home to his native Argentina to attend personal matters. 'I don't know what happened because I was on the floor but I think we deserved a draw. 'We were playing very well in the first half but we couldn't score one or two goals.

Tunisia -- lying just across the Mediterranean from Europe, but bordered on one side by Libya and on the other by Algeria -- has until now not suffered the kind of large-scale terror attacks seen in both those nations in recent years. But it has emerged as a place of increasing concern as the threat of Islamist extremism has intensified in the region. Islamist terrorists also have struck in Algeria, where they killed at least 37 hostages at a gas field in 2013, and in Libya, where terrorists killed the U.S. ambassador and three others in 2012 and where ISIS has established a beachhead in the east. Al Qaeda's North African offshoot Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which has its roots in Algeria, has captured territory in Mali and taken hostages -- often Europeans -- in countries such as Niger and Mauritania. So what is the world doing about it? The United States has created a military command in Africa and also established a special operations base in Djibouti, which borders Somalia in the Horn of Africa. France has sent troops to Mali. And, as CNN recently reported from Chad, Western militaries have trained special forces from several northern African nations to take on the Islamists. Here's a country-by-country look -- although not exhaustive -- at how Islamist extremism has reared its head across a swath of Africa. Algeria is home to a long-running Islamist insurgency. In perhaps the highest-profile incident, Islamist militants attacked the In Amenas oil and gas plant in southern Algeria in January 2013. At least 37 hostages, including three U.S. citizens, died in the seizure of, and ensuing special forces assault on, the remote facility. Dozens of assailants also died in the days-long siege. The attack was the work of the Mulathameen Brigade, which translates as the \"Signatories in Blood Brigade.\" Last September, another Islamist group beheaded a 55-year-old French hiker, Herve Gourdel, after seizing him as he walked in Djudjura National Park in central Algeria. Days earlier, the outfit -- Jund al Khilafa, a splinter group of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -- had pledged allegiance to ISIS. Militants affiliated with AQIM had previously also kidnapped foreigners in Algeria, including Italians and Spaniards. In 2007, AQIM launched a suicide bombing campaign in Algeria, which included a deadly bombing against the U.N. headquarters in Algiers. In January, a suicide bombing and gun attack on a hotel in the capital, Tripoli, killed 10 people, including an American. The attack was swiftly claimed by Wilayat al-Tarabulus, ISIS' name for the province. Politicians in Tripoli disputed the claim. Besides its growing presence in Tripoli, ISIS is now the dominant force in Derna in eastern Libya and controls parts of the town center of Sirte, the hometown of former Libya strongman Moammar Gadhafi. Before the advent of ISIS, an Islamist group called Ansar al Shariah was blamed by the United States for carrying out the September 11,  2012, attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi in which Ambassador Christopher Stevens was killed. State Department computer expert Sean Smith and former U.S. Navy SEALs Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, then acting as security contractors, also died. In 2012, Islamist extremists capitalized on chaos in Mali after a military coup and uprising by Tuareg tribesmen to seize control of a large piece of northern Mali, an area the size of France. France intervened militarily in early 2013 and helped to push back the Islamists. Since then, Mali's government has battled various rebel factions, mostly in its northern region, with the help of French and African forces. Recent attacks include a shooting earlier this month at a bar popular with expatriates in the capital, Bamako, which killed five people, including French and Belgian citizens, authorities said. A North African jihadist group, al-Murabitun, claimed responsibility for the attack, according to Mauritanian news agency Al Akhbar. AQIM issued a warning to France via jihadist websites in January, following terror attacks in Paris, stating that \"France pays the cost of its violence on Muslim countries and the violation of their sanctity,\" citing the presence of its soldiers in Mali. According to analysis by Jane's Defence Weekly, despite the shift of jihadist activity east toward Libya, \"Mauritania is still an aspirational target for jihadist groups due to its military co-operation with France and Algeria.\" Jihadist groups including AQIM and the Mulathameen Brigade operate in the porous border areas between Mauritania, Algeria, Mali, Niger and Libya. Militants have in the past kidnapped foreign workers for ransom, including three Spaniards in 2011, according to Jane's. However, since 2011 jihadist activity in the country has declined. Mauritanian troops joined the fight against AQIM militants in Mali. Militant group Boko Haram has waged a campaign of terror in mostly northern Nigeria for over a decade. It has attacked the country's police, military, banks, bus stations and crowded markets, as well carrying out a string of church bombings. Perhaps the most notorious incident came last April, when Boko Haram militants kidnapped more than 200 teenage girls from a boarding school in Chibok, in Borno state. Most of the girls remain missing. In January this year, hundreds of Boko Haram gunmen seized the town of Baga and neighboring villages in northern Nigeria, as well as a multinational military base, leaving bodies scattered everywhere and as many as 2,000 people feared dead. The group's stated aim is to institute Sharia, or Islamic law. Earlier this month, in an audio message purportedly from leader Abubakar Shekau, Boko Haram pledged allegiance to ISIS. It had previously declared ties to AQIM. Al-Shabaab started with a goal of waging a war against the Somali government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or Sharia. It has since shifted focus to terrorist attacks in Somalia and beyond, notably neighboring Kenya. Its most high-profile attack came in that country in 2013, when gunmen struck at Nairobi's upscale Westgate mall, pulling out weapons and gunning down shoppers. The gunmen were accused of torturing some hostages before killing them. As many as 67 people died in the siege. The group has carried out numerous attacks in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, and elsewhere. Just last week, its target was government offices in the city of Baidoa. It has also recently called for attacks on shopping malls in the United States, Canada and Britain. The Pentagon said this week that a key Al-Shabaab operative connected to the Westgate mall attack, named as Adan Garar, was killed recently by a U.S. drone strike. In September, Al-Shabaab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane was also killed in a U.S. airstrike near Barawe city. Gunmen who besieged the Bardo Museum in Tunis are thought to have claimed 23 lives, most of them foreign tourists. Interior Ministry spokesman Mohamed Ali Aroui told national radio that the assailants were Islamists, but authorities haven't been more specific than that. Nine arrests have been made in connection with the attack. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack in an audio message posted online Thursday. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the audio statement. The attack occurred even as the country's democratically elected Parliament was meeting to discuss new anti-terror legislation. Up to 3,000 Tunisians are believed to have traveled to Iraq and Syria to fight as jihadists, more than any other country, according to the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization in London. The fear is that many of these fighters will return to North Africa to join ISIS-affiliated groups there and carry out attacks. Al Qaeda's North African affiliate is also a threat. In late 2012, AQIM set up a branch in Tunisia called the Uqba ibn Nafi Brigade, a 60-strong Jihadi outfit composed of Tunisians, Algerians, and some Libyans. The group, believed to include fighters driven out of Mali by French forces, has been responsible for a string of attacks on Tunisian security services in mountainous Djebel Chaambi region along the Algerian border.

Pierre Le Guennec, 74, and Danielle, 73, were given a suspended prison sentence of two years by a court in the French Riviera town of Grasse. Both had insisted that they were all 'presents' from the legendary Spanish artist, but the court found they were 'fraudulently obtained' and ordered them to be returned to his family. Pierre Le Guennec (right) and his wife Danielle wait for the verdict of their trial. The court today found the couple were found guilty of stashing the 'fraudulently obtained' artwork . The couple address the media following the verdict, in which they were ordered to return the Picasso treasures and given a suspended prison sentence of two years . It was in November 2010 that 271 lithographs, cubist paintings, notebooks and a watercolour were found at their modest home in Mouans-Sartoux, in the South of France. But six of Picasso's descendants accused them of the crime, and will now take charge of the works. During the trial, all 271 works, created between 1900 and 1932, were beamed onto a giant screen inside the court. Le Guennec claimed he was given the collection by the artist and his second wife, Jacqueline, when he was an odd job man at their home in Notre-Dame-de-Vie in Mougins, near Cannes. Le Guennec, a qualified electrician, installed a burglar alarm at the luxury villa before the artist died in 1973, and said he accepted them as 'thank you' gifts. Referring to Picasso, Mr Le Guennec said he 'often invited me in to have some cake or a coffee. Me and the master talked about all things great and small. 'One evening, I was leaving my work, when Madame handed me a little package saying: 'This is for you'. But Claude Picasso, the artist's son, said that his father was noted for his generosity, but that he always dedicated, dated and signed his gifts, as he knew that some recipients might try to sell the works one day. Two of the newly discovered Picasso drawings, one in a notebook (above left), and the other called 'Nature Morte Verre' (Still life Glass) Jean-Jacques Neuer, Claude Picasso's barrister, said: 'They don't remember whether they received the so called gift in 1970, 71 or 72. If you are given 271 Picassos, you remember it. 'You have to imagine that Picasso kept hold of them for 70 years and suddenly decided to give the lot away. That's doesn't make sense.' The only document with the name Le Guennec on is a signed brochure for a Picasso exhibition, said Mr Neuer. 'When you give a present, you choose something precise that fits the person,' said Mr Neuer. 'Picasso here is giving away works that have nothing to do with each other - notably extremely precious cubist collages that represent 10 per cent of his production,' he said. The couple listen to Judge Jean-Christophe Bruyere give the verdict at a court in Grasse, southeast France . Picasso's son Claude Ruiz (left) and daughter Maya sit in the courtroom today awaiting the verdict . Another Picasso drawing, this time of a horse, from Pierre Le Guennec's collection that he kept in his garage . 'But also two notebooks of drawings, work tools that he would never have given away. The issue is not whether Picasso was generous or not. Picasso wasn't someone who was careless about his works \u2013 he didn't give work away just for the sake of it.' Charles-Etienne Gudin, lawyer for the couple, said the works came from the artist's 'Grands-Augustins' studio on Paris's Left Bank. He said that Mr Le Guennec would never have stolen from the Picasso's villa, describing it as a 'fortress' watched over night and day by security guards. The trial comes after Marina Picasso, the artist's granddaughter, said she was selling of the famous villa, along with a selection of his work, for up to \u00a3190m. Ms Picasso wrote a memoir 'Picasso: My Grandfather' in 2001, in which she accused him of destroying her childhood. Picasso's works are the most stolen of any artist in history. He has more than 1,000 paintings registered as taken unlawfully, missing or disputed. A painting of a hand by Picasso that was among 271 undocumented, never-before-seen works estimated to be worth at least \u00a350million .

At a proceeds of crime hearing Mason, a contract worker, was told failure to pay will result in a default sentence of 12 months in prison. Detective Constable David Williams, a financial investigator said: 'This sentence sends a clear message to anyone thinking of trying to evade payment of train fares and parking that it really isn't worth it.' A search of the fraudster's home revealed a sophisticated  set-up to make the fake train travel and parking tickets, including a software package which allowed him to design the counterfeit tickets (pictured) After raiding Mason's home, police found fake and genuine tickets, glossy photographic paper,  printers, as well as craft knives, scissors and a cutting board, which were all used in the ticket-making process . Mason, of Hatfield, Doncaster, in South Yorkshire, was sentenced to six months in prison suspended for two years. He has also been ordered to carry out 240 hours unpaid work and a 12-day restorative justice course at Sheffield Crown Court. The British Transport Police investigation began in autumn 2013 when East Coast Trains station support staff saw Mason's black Vauxhall Meriva car on several occasions in the Executive Car Park at Doncaster train station. Various ticket discrepancies were noted including an expired ticket and tickets with wrong colours, no date and time printed, incorrect emblems and incorrect value paid. Replicating the real tickets, Mason used  software to change the details on the ticket in order to get free travel. He included the type of ticket, the date, the price, the journey and the printing date (pictured) But inspectors noticed various ticket discrepancies, including an expired ticket and tickets with wrong colours, no date and time printed, incorrect emblems and incorrect value paid . Mason used the software to forge the back of the train ticket in meticulous detail (pictured). He has been ordered to pay back \u00a317,884 over six months after he was convicted of fraud charges . BTP was informed and in December an officer spotted the car and approached Mason when he returned to his vehicle later that day. He was arrested on suspicion of fraud offences and a search of the car revealed 10 further tickets believed to have been forged. Forensic examination of the computer devices found at his home revealed Mason had used the computers to produce forged travel and parking tickets. The offences were committed between March 24, 2011, and December 19, 2013.

A Chinese restaurant in Nairobi,  which barred black customers after 5pm, has been shut down with its owners summoned before authorities .

Despite Budi's initial hesitation, it's not long before the two are climbing the hammock together and a 'bond of friendship is beginning to form between them'. The Chief Executive of the charity that rescued Budi hopes his new-found friendship with Jemmi gets them both used to orangutans so they can hopefully be released into the wild some day. Alan Knight said: 'As they start to form bonds with each other and then with other orangutans in baby school, they will learn from each other how to behave in the forest and gradually shed their dependence on their human babysitters.' Tough start: Budi's new playmate Jemmi (right) was orphaned when his mother was killed - and then illegally sold as a pet . Rescued: Budi also had a tough start to life Budi the orangutan and was found (pictured) lying on his back in a wire chicken coop without the strength to sit up . Tragedy: This photo, taken at the time of his rescue, shows the 10-month-old with a thin blanket in his cage for comfort . Healthy: Now the baby orangutan is strong enough to support his own wait - and even swing and play . First impressions: Budi was very shy when he first met his new companion Jemmi (pictured), who confidently inspected his fellow primate . Confident: Although Budi is initially quite shy, his new friend Jemmi (pictured) curiously inspects him and coaxes him to play .

Neglect: Before Budi was rescued, his owner had never given him a single mouthful of solid food for fear it would be bad for him - leaving his tiny limbs swollen and bent . 'We couldn't be happier to see how well Budi is getting on with his new playmate. This first meeting is a milestone in the development of both babies.' Budi was in a critical condition when International Animal Rescue found him in Indonesia in December and immediately took him to their orangutan rehabilitation centre. At just over one year old, he should have been able to climb and swing but the helpless baby was too weak to even open his mouth. Earlier footage showed him crying in pain when one of his carers gently turned his body or lifted him to sit up. But thanks to intensive treatment and care from International Animal Rescue's veterinary team, he made a remarkable recovery. Recent videos released by the charity showed Budi drinking from a bottle unaided, eating pureed food from a spoon and doing some physical therapy. In another video he is shown fast asleep, exhausted after his physical exertions. The baby orangutan become an internet sensation after his story was first told by MailOnline. Transformation: The change in Budi in a few short weeks is remarkable. Here he is pictured exercising at the rescue centre in Borneo . Strength: The tiny orangutan didn't have the muscle strength to open his mouth when he was first rescued from a life of neglect . Release: International Animal Rescue's chief executive said: 'They will learn from each other how to behave in the forest and gradually shed their dependence on their human babysitters' International Animal Rescue are keen to stress that Budi's story is not an isolate case and there are 'countless' orangutans currently suffering from neglect in Indonesia. The charity is currently caring for 83 orangutans who were being kept illegally as pets. The primates of all ages are now undergoing rehabilitation so they can eventually be released back into the wild. Mr Knight added: 'People are being very generous in their response to Budi's story and I would urge everyone please to keep on supporting us. 'The more people give, the more orangutans we can rescue and help on their journey back to a protected place in the forest where they belong.'", "reference": "Baby orangutan Budi was too weak to move when he was rescued in January .\nInternational Animal Rescue found him living in a tiny chicken cage in Borneo .\nHe is now strong enough to swing around and even play with other orangutans .\nAn adorable video captures his first encounter with his new companion Jemmi .\nHis eight-month-old friend was orphaned as a baby and sold illegally as a pet .\nCharity hope they will both become less dependent on the 'human babysitters'"}, "395": {"id": "b38ca75f08c6beb3c73d089b6269f90605804925", "article": "Christopher Taft, 21, was arrested on charges of aggravated assault .

Chief Mike Koval said he knows Madison is being watched across the nation since 19-year-old Tony Robinson's death on Friday evening, and he has gone out of his way to avoid what he once called Ferguson's 'missteps.' 'Folks are angry, resentful, mistrustful, disappointed, shocked, chagrined. I get that,' Koval said Saturday. 'People need to tell me squarely how upset they are with the Madison Police Department.' Scroll down for video . Chief Mike Koval said he knows Madison is being watched across the nation since 19-year-old Tony Robinson's death on Friday evening, and he has gone out of his way to avoid what he once called Ferguson's 'missteps' The contrasts with Ferguson are many. While Ferguson police initially gave little information about the shooting of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old, unarmed black man, Koval rushed to the home of Robinson's mother. She didn't want to meet with him, he said, but he talked and prayed with Robinson's grandmother in the driveway for 45 minutes. It took a week for Ferguson to release the name of the officer who shot Brown. Koval announced the name of the officer involved in Madison, Matt Kenny, the day after the shooting. He volunteered to reporters that the officer had been in a previous fatal shooting in 2007, and that he had been cleared of wrongdoing. On the day that Ferguson police named the officer who shot Brown, they also released video showing what they said was Brown robbing a store. Tony Robinson, an unarmed black 19-year-old, was fatally shot Friday, by Matt Kenny, a white police officer, the Madison police chief said Saturday . When Koval was asked about Robinson's past criminal record Saturday, he declined to comment, saying it would be inappropriate to do so a day after the man died. 'We have a police chief who genuinely feels for a family's loss. It should be abundantly clear to anyone following this incident that Madison, Wisconsin, is not Ferguson, Missouri,' said Jim Palmer, executive director of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association, the state's largest police union. But the chief's measured approach hasn't impressed some demonstrators. Koval angered some of them earlier this year with a blog post demanding they stop blaming police for their problems. 'There are no apologies that can repair the loss or deal with the loss of (Robinson),' said Brandi Grayson, an organizer with Young, Gifted and Black, a Madison group that has demonstrated against what it says is mistreatment of blacks by the justice system. 'This was bound to happen. There's nothing the chief can say short of changing the system.' People gather outside the house where Tony Robinson was shot during a rally on Saturday to protest his death . Robinson died on Friday night after Kenny shot him in an apartment during a confrontation. Kenny had responded to a call of a man jumping in and out of traffic. Kenny forced his way into the apartment after hearing what Koval described as a 'disturbance.' The state Justice Department's Division of Criminal Investigation has taken over the investigation under a new state law passed last year that requires an outside agency to lead probes of officer-involved shootings. DOJ spokeswoman Anne Schwartz declined to comment on Sunday. The shooting comes against a backdrop of multiple instances of white police officers killing unarmed black men around the country over the last year. The highest-profile incident was the death of Brown in Ferguson last August. Days of violence ensued, marked by looting, fires, police firing tear gas into a crowd and officers pointing weapons at demonstrators. Another round of riots broke out in November after a grand jury chose not to indict the officer who shot Brown, Darren Wilson. While Robinson's mom didn't want to meet with him, Madison Police Chief Mike Koval talked and prayed with the dead man's grandmother for 45 minutes . Relatives and friends of Tony Robinson exit a gathering of church representatives, community leaders and residents at Fountain of Life Covenant Church, Saturday, in Madison, Wis. Last week the U.S. Justice Department declined to charge Wilson with civil rights violations but issued a scathing report accusing the Ferguson police department of racism and using policing to fund the city's budget. Koval, who is white, took over as Madison's chief in April, replacing retiring black Chief Noble Wray. In September he told the Wisconsin State Journal he believed his department could deal with a racially charged shooting better than Ferguson, saying his agency is more diverse and more invested in the community than Ferguson's 'rent-a-cops.' 'I see in Ferguson a series of missteps and miscues where they're always reacting and, in fact, over-reacting to every set of facts that is thrown in their midst, frankly,' Koval said in the interview. Two months ago, Koval wrote a blog post criticizing Young, Black and Gifted for blaming his officers for 'everything from male pattern baldness to global warming.' The entry came in response to the group staging protests over officer-involved deaths during rush-hour traffic, demanding jail officials release 350 black inmates and imploring police to stay out of black neighborhoods. Koval tried to be diplomatic when asked about the post on Saturday, saying he and the group have agreed to disagree on policing black neighborhoods. Grayson said Koval has had plenty of time to prepare for a racially charged shooting after watching what unfolded in Ferguson. 'He had a perfect response \u2014 perfect for white people,' she said.

The Yangtze finless porpoise is facing the same fate as their cousin, the river dolphins which were officially declared extinct in 2006, wiped out by human development in the world's most populous country. There are just 1,000 of the fresh water mammals left living in the world's longest river, but number are declining by more than 13 per cent every year, the People's Daily Online reports.

The project aimed to catch the Yangtze's last remaining water mammals, attracting them using sonar to allow them to collect data on their health, gender, weight and measurements. The strongest animals were then taken to be released into other areas, where scientists hope they will help increase the populations. Plan: A new project sees some of the strongest animals from the largest population being relocated .

Wildlife SOS were then forced to call the police as the mob became violent with over 40 officers drafted in to try to calm the situation. But with fears for the safety of the rescue team, a local magistrate ordered the operation to be aborted and the charity had to leave the elephant behind.

Also on hand to welcome the Dutch royals at Kastrup Airport's private royal terminal were other members of the Danish Royal Family, among them Frederik's younger brother Joachim. 45-year-old Joachim's French wife Princess Marie was also there and wore an ensemble that echoed her sister-in-law's. Queen Margrethe, who along with Queen Elizabeth II, is one of the world's only Queens Regnant, then led the way out of the airport, escorted by King Willem-Alexander. The Dutch royals are at the start of a three-day state visit to Denmark, aimed at strengthening links between the two countries. Unsurprisingly, the programme is a busy one, with Maxima and Willem-Alexander set to criss-cross the country over the next couple of days.

Tomorrow will see them visit the carbon-neutral Sams\u00f8 island, accompanied by Crown Prince Frederik and his wife Mary, to visit a special type of Danish boarding school called an efterskole. Most Danish teenagers spend at least a year at the state boarding schools, where they are encouraged to focus on specific interests such as music.

A 'black widow' who married a man on his death bed just eight days before he died has been jailed for stealing his granddaughter's inheritance. Judith Brown, 55, wed Roy Mitchell, 66, just over a week before he died after a long illness in 2011, but he changed his will so she would be the main beneficiary and trustee. Of Mr Mitchell's \u00a3180,000 estate, \u00a360,000 was supposed to be divided between his four grandchildren to be spent on their education - but the widow stole \u00a315,000. Brown-Mitchell, as she became known after she married, was Mr Mitchell's carer as he battled bowel cancer in 2011. He changed his will at the end of August that year and the pair, who met in 2006, married days later - but the then terminally ill man's family were not invited and were only told of the marriage by text message. Mr Mitchell's family also had no idea his will had been changed in Mitchell-Brown's favour until he died. After his death on September 10, 2011,\u00a0Brown-Mitchell, of Haverthwaite,  Cumbria, should have handed over \u00a360,000 for the children's education but refused to do so, Preston Crown Court heard. Eventually \u00a345,000 of this was seized after a previous court hearing, but the rest of the inheritance - meant for the eldest granddaughter - was 'squandered', as well as a further \u00a3100,000 spent on 'shopping and entertaining herself'. Judge Howard Bentham criticised Brown-Mitchell for stealing \u00a315,000 from a minor as he jailed her for two years. He said the defence of her actions was 'incredible' and said she had 'wilfully and deliberately' failed in her actions as a trustee. Jeremy Grout-Smith, prosecuting, told the court how Brown-Mitchell, who fostered young offenders before being struck down with multiple sclerosis, had pleaded guilty to the theft of \u00a315,000 between September 2011 and October 2014. He said she had struck up a friendship with Mr Mitchell in 2006 and when he had fallen ill had become his carer. 'Black widow': Brown-Mitchell married Mr Mitchell on his deathbed, with his family only finding out about the wedding by text message . Mr Mitchell, 66, pictured with his daughter Nina, died in 2011 after losing his battle with bowel cancer . Mr Grout-Smith said: 'He didn't want to die in hospital so he moved into her home and at weekends they would go to his caravan on the Holker Estate. He had bought a caravan there because of his love of the Lake District. 'He changed his will on August 31, 2011 and married the defendant in a deathbed marriage on September 2. He died eight days later. Brown-Mitchell was jailed for two years for stealing from a minor . 'She was the executor and trustee of the will and was to give a legacy of \u00a315,000 to each of the four grandchildren, which they would get once they reached the age of 18. 'He had left his estate, valued at \u00a3180,000, to the defendant.' Mr Grout-Smith added that the cash was never handed over and a long legal battle ensued. In the meantime Brown-Mitchell had been convicted of benefit fraud after failing to declare the inheritance. Donna Mitchell, the deceased's daughter, said in her impact statement: '[Brown-Mitchell] isolated him from us and his friends. She married him when he was dying and he changed his will. We never got to see him again as by the time we did he was in and out of consciousness. 'She has shown no remorse and doesn't seem to care.' But Laura Heywood, defending the 'black widow', said that Mr Mitchell's relationship with his daughters had deteriorated. She said: 'It wasn't all happy families at all. Brown-Mitchell had put \u00a345,000 in a 10-year plan to safeguard it and was keeping the other \u00a315,000 as the eldest grandchild would be 18 before that plan matured. 'She has ended up depressed by the way she has been pursued by the family. She thinks she also had a breakdown as one day she bought 36 cans of cat food and she doesn't even own a cat. 'Her strongest mitigation is that she pleaded guilty. She is remorseful for what happened. She never intended to spend this money but she has used it on the cost of general living.' Nina Taylor (left), Mr Mitchell's (right) daughter, said the family referred to Mitchell-Brown as a 'black widow' as they cannot bear to say her name . After Mr Mitchell's (centre right) death in September 2011, Brown-Mitchell should have handed over \u00a360,000 for the children's education but refused to do so . Judge Bentham said: 'I am sentencing you for stealing \u00a315,000 from a minor when you were trustee of the estate. 'You have squandered \u00a3100,000 from the estate and you have wilfully and deliberately failed in your actions as a trustee. 'Your defence was incredible. You will go to prison for two years.' Brown-Mitchell remained emotionless as she was led away to the cells. Speaking after the hearing, Mr Mitchell's 17-year-old granddaughter Charlotte - who was due the stolen money - sobbed as she described how she missed her granddad and the trauma the case had caused. She said: 'I'm so glad it's all over. I'm happy she has gone to prison after what she did. 'She has caused so much pain and heartache for our family.' Mr Mitchell's daughter Nina Taylor, 42, said:\u00a0'This has been a very long and traumatic time for me and my family causing a great loss of money to us along with the children. 'I have been off work due to anxiety and panic attacks on medication for stress. 'For the past three-and-a-half years my sister and myself have spent time going to civil court due to inheritance my father left for his four grandchildren. 'Mrs Brown-Mitchell was a friend of my father's for a number of years though I believe that she knew my father had a long-term illness. She tried to cut off my father's family and friends. 'Due to a court order we did manage to take over a policy in Mrs Brown Mitchell's name of \u00a345,000 without her consent but still there was \u00a315,000 missing and also costs of \u00a310,000 approximately which have not been paid. 'This has been a very traumatic time for myself, my sister our families and the grandchildren.' Daughters Mrs Taylor (left) and Donna Mitchell (right) said the last three-and-a-half years had been 'traumatic' Mrs Taylor, a teaching assistant from Warrington, added: 'I believe that she played on my father and whilst he was very ill turned him against us. 'This is a heartbreaking situation that Mrs Brown-Mitchell has caused. We call her the black widow as we can't stand to say her name. 'I have trouble sleeping at night as this situation is constantly playing on my mind and have also been prescribed sleeping tablets. 'I cannot think about anything else, I am unable to trust people and my children cannot understand how an adult can do such a disgusting thing and possibly get away with it. 'My daughter Charlotte is due to go to university and my father's wishes were that the grandchildren use their inheritance for property or education. As Charlotte's is the missing money she will be unable to use this.' She added: 'We can now get on with our lives. I have no sympathy for her. She's a black widow and deserves all she gets. 'I would say that I hope she rots in hell but we got justice and that's all that matters. She took our dad away from us.'", "reference": "Judith Brown married Roy Mitchell just eight days before he died of cancer .\nMr Mitchell, 66, changed his will to her name in the weeks before his death .\nBrown-Mitchell was supposed to give \u00a360,000 to his four grandchildren .\nBut she stole \u00a315,000 and spent it on 'shopping and entertaining herself'\n'Black widow' also 'squandered' another \u00a3100,000 from Mr Mitchell's estate .\nJudge says Brown-Mitchell's defence of her actions was 'incredible'\nShe was jailed for two years after pleading guilty to stealing from a minor ."}, "408": {"id": "0292052bcba6d93587f21141f72e7569d4b6f40c", "article": "A nursing assistant has been suspended from a hospital for mentally ill young people over claims she sent a suicidal teenage patient instructions on how to kill herself.

He captivates audiences with his depiction of 1920\u2019s upper-class society, taking in the rules and etiquette of the time and creating characters who struggle to live by them. But Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes has revealed that he drew on his own experience for his latest storyline for the show set in the roaring 1920s. Lord Fellowes said he used an episode of romantic rejection when he was a young man to create a plot for the show\u2019s fifth series. His character Lady Rose, played by actress Lily James, was torn between her love interest, the son of Jewish immigrants and her family who do not approve of him. The 65-year-old told the New York Times that he too was left feeling insecure after he was rejected by one of his first loves because of his religion. 'I felt it as a Catholic when I was young. One of my first girlfriends was from a fairly senior Jewish family', he said. 'They were a very nice family \u2013 I\u2019m still friendly, actually, with the girl and her brother. 'But her parents wanted a Jewish husband. 'And it\u2019s a very strange feeling when you realise that people don\u2019t like you because of what you are.\u2019 He also told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz that the rejection was 'sort of my first experience of not being desirable.' He added: 'They certainly didn\u2019t want a Catholic in the family. \u2018People always think the prejudice is one-way, but it can be two ways. I wanted to use that in the show.\u2019 He said the 1920s was a time when: \u2018People didn\u2019t mind if you came to their house or you shot their pheasants, you ate their dinners or went to their daughter\u2019s dances. 'But, my God, they didn\u2019t want you to marry her.\u2019 Lord Fellowes refused to identify the woman who spurned him, but has said she belongs to one of the 'great Jewish families'.

Keane, who managed Sunderland and Ipswich Town, is not required to attend court, but the postponement suggests that he may intend to do so. He was said to have launched into a foul-mouthed tirade and made obscene gestures after jumping out his Range Rover in Altrincham, Greater Manchester on the morning of January 30. Taxi driver Fateh Kerar, 44, claims the row last month was sparked when he and his female passenger spotted the TV pundit at a cash machine in nearby Hale.

Documents have revealed a key figure of his London-based terror cell talked to one of the terrorists on the day of the attempted tube bombing - the would be terrorist was later jailed for life over the failed attack. Scroll down for video . Mohammed Emwazi (pictured) who was revealed as Islamic State's cold-blooded executioner Jihadi John this week, was a member of a terror cell that was known to have links to the failed July 21 attacks on London . The revelation has raised even more questions over how Emwazi, the Islamic State extremist behind the beheading of western hostages, was able to run away from Britain and the scrutiny of the security services despite being a member of the watched terror cell. Emwazi, who was brought up in west London, was subject to a no fly order and was on a terror watch list but still managed to leave without detection. It was revealed this week that he was a 'person of interest' to MI5 as a member of a cell known as The London Boys, which was set up to recruit and raise funds for Somalia-based terror group al Shabab. MI5 was also aware of Emwazi for six years before he appeared on a hostage video for the first time in August 2014. And now, even more worryingly, it has been revealed at least one member of his network had a connection with the worst terrorist atrocity to take place on British soil. The failed July 21 attacks came just two weeks after four men blew themselves up on London's tubes and a bus, killing 52 people and injuring more than 700 in 2005. CCTV footage of failed July 21 bomber Hussein Osman (circled in green) at Clapham Junction train station . Metropolitan Police footage  showing Ismail Abdurahman with Hussein Osman at Vauxhall train station . Court documents seen by The Observer reveal a leading member of Emwazi's network had a phone conversation on the day of the attacks with Hussein Osman, who was later jailed for life for placing an explosive at Shepherd's Bush tube station. The documents show that security services were aware that associates of the 12-strong west London terror group had joined the four July 21 bombers at a training camp in Cumbria a year before the attempted terror attack. On Friday, Boris Johnson lashed out at Home Secretary Theresa May for watering down strict anti-terror powers which may have helped Emwazi escape the net and travel to Syria. The London Mayor accused his Tory leadership rival of giving the 'benefit of the doubt' to terror suspects like Emzawi. Mr Johnson's attack comes amid the growing controversy over who is to blame for MI5's failure to stop 'known wolf' Emwazi leaving Britain for the front line in Syria in 2013. The Government's independent reviewer of terror legislation David Anderson admitted MI5 may have 'slipped up'. But he said: 'One won't know until there's been an inquiry or a report of some kind.' But experts believe Emwazi was helped to escape Britain by his terror associates who had been allowed back to London by the Government in 2011.

It is understood that three members of Emwazi's network were made subject in 2011 to control orders brought in by the last Labour government, which meant they had to live outside London. But the control orders were disbanded by the coalition and they were instead subject to Tpims \u2013 terrorism prevention and investigation measures \u2013 which allowed them to return to London and re-engage with Emwazi. Two of the men on these weakened orders \u2013 known only as BX and CC in the court documents \u2013 aided with money, a false identity and bogus travel documents by the London jihadi cell. The power to relocate terror suspects was reintroduced a fortnight ago, under growing pressure from the security services. Mr Johnson slammed the 2011 'mistake' to scrap the 'internal exile' powers contained in Labour's control order regime. The Mayor of London said: 'We need to keep a very, very close eye on these people. 'The decision to modify the control orders, to water them down I think in retrospect looks as though it was a mistake because it is vital to be able, when you are controlling these people to be able to relocate them, to take them away from their support networks and look after them, to monitor them properly. 'We are now back on the right track and it just confirms to me the vital importance of us being able to monitor these people, to keep tabs on them, to look at what they are saying to each other in their email, their electronic contact. 'This whole thing needs to be tackled very, very robustly. 'We need to have a very strong security response that gives our people, gives our security services and the police the surveillance powers that they need.' British Journalist David Haines (pictured) who was killed by Jihadi John - believed to be Mohammed Emwazi . Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette cooper shadow backed the London Mayor's attack on Mrs May. She said: 'We warned the Government from the start not to abolish control orders. I said in Parliament many times that those relocation powers were immensely important and that removing them would make it easier for terror suspects to organise.' The Labour shadow minister added: 'At the very least, the Prime Minister should ask the Intelligence and Security Committee to examine the period following the scrapping of relocation. 'Parliament needs to know whether the legislation to alter counter terror powers affected the UK's ability to prevent people travelling to Syria. 'The Home Secretary has a duty to protect national security, so if the decisions she made on legislation against expert advice have weakened national security instead, the public and Parliament have a right to know.' A Home Office spokesman said:\u00a0'Control orders were not working and were being struck down by the courts. 'Tpims have been endorsed by the courts, counter-terrorism reviewers, the police, and the Security Service. 'Following a review of the powers available to manage the terrorist threat, the range of measures available under the TPIM Act is being extended including a measure to allow Tpim subjects to be relocated to different parts of the country. 'Additionally the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act, which became law this month, will bolster our already considerable armoury of powers to disrupt the ability of people to travel abroad to fight, reduce the risks they pose on their return and combat the underlying ideology that feeds, supports and sanctions terrorism.'", "reference": "Mohammed Emwazi was revealed as Islamic State's executioner last week .\nHe had links to the 2005 bomb plotters who tried to blow up the tube .\nFailed attack was due to take place just two weeks after 21/7 bombing .\n52 people were killed and 700 injured in worst terror attack on British soil .\nCourt documents reveal key\u00a0member\u00a0of Emwazi's watched terror cell spoke to one\u00a0of the failed terrorists on the day of the attempted bombing .\nRevelation raises urgent questions over how Emwazi was able to leave UK ."}, "413": {"id": "28efe544cf18a63ca31ed08a364031604aed194b", "article": "Carlos Mars, 19, is facing assault and weapons charges . Police have arrested a 19-year-old student in connection with a stabbing at Morgan State University that left three football players injured. Police said Wednesday that Carlos Mars has been charged with assault and weapons charges. The stabbing happened Tuesday afternoon when a fight broke out between two groups of students at the Baltimore-based campus. Police say two men were slashed, one across the chest and one in the back, and a third student suffered abrasions. Charging documents show that a witness told investigators that Mars 'repeatedly and aggressively' stabbed another student in the chest during a fight. But Mars told investigators he 'swung his knife around in a wild manner' to keep students away from his friend, who also was involved in the fight. Police say Mars remains in jail. It was the third instance of violence on the Baltimore campus in less than a week. The players were taken to hospitals and their injuries were not considered to be life-threatening, police said. University spokesman Clint Coleman said one of the players was slashed across the chest and another was cut on the arm.

This is the third instance of recent violence. On Friday, a male student was stabbed with scissors by his roommate after an argument over the cleanliness of their dorm room. Early Saturday, an on-campus party was broken up after fights started. School officials held a campus meeting Tuesday night to talk about what happened. 'We expect you as students to take responsibility for your own behavior and actions,' University president David Wilson told those in attendance. Two groups of people got into a fight outside a dining hall on the Morgan State University campus, and some football players were stabbed by someone swinging a knife wildly, police and college officials said . History: Morgan State is the largest historically black university in Maryland and has about 6,000 students . Earlier Tuesday, Wilson sent an email to students that declared 'This is not Morgan!' Kevin Banks, vice president for student affairs, repeated that assertion. 'The stuff you've seen on TV the past few days is not Morgan State University,' Banks said. Wilson also said no text alerts were sent to students immediately after the stabbing because 'the general public was not in imminent danger because this was a fight between known parties and not a random act of violence.' But Freshman Shakia Marine, 20, who did not attend the campus meeting, said she is a little worried about the latest spate of violence. 'My godfather has concerns about me coming here,' Marine said. 'There needs to be more security guards walking around. After today, it made me feel scared. My roommate said we should get some Mace to protect ourselves. I think the school needs to take more action. It's not the first time something like this has happened.'

Sixteen-month-old Angel Pitts tragically died when she wandered in front of the family car outside her home in Leeds, West Yorkshire, last June. An inquest into her death heard how father, Scott Pitts, 36, was calling his partner to fetch the family's Jack Russell from the road when the accident happened. Angel Pitts was tragically knocked down and killed when her father accidentally drove into her last summer . The little girl - who had only just learned to walk - was found underneath the family's Toyota Avensis by her devastated father. He initially thought he had hit one of children's garden toys left on the drive, the hearing was told. Sergeant Carl Quinn, from West Yorkshire Police's Collision Investigation Unit, told the coroner: 'Scott got into his vehicle to go and collect a DVD for the family to watch later that evening. 'Angel was in the house watching TV. He went forward when the dog followed him out of the gate. He called to Megin to fetch it inside. Angel had apparently left the house unseen by anyone. 'She walked into the road to the near side of the vehicle within the path of the turning car - she was struck by the near side front wheel resulting in a knock to the ground and injuries to her head. 'Scott realised he had impacted with something which he thought was one of the children's toys. As he looked he found Angel underneath the car by the front wheels.' Mr Pitts' partner Megin Darch told police in interview: 'Scott shouted at me to pick up the dog as he didn't want to run it over so I went out to pick it up. It always runs in the road. 'Shortly after I heard a scream. He was screaming 'help me, help me'.' Mr Pitts thought his daughter was inside the family home in Leeds, West Yorkshire at the time of the accident . Mourners at Angel's funeral wore animal onesies and pink clothes in memory of the 16-month-old . Neighbour Craig Holmes said he heard a man screaming for help from across the road and looked out to see Scott carrying the little girl as his partner Megin Darch rushed out and wailed. Recording a verdict of accidental death, Assistant Coroner Jonathan Leach said he was satisfied Scott Pitts had not been able to see the youngster in front of the car. In a statement read to the Leeds court, Ms Darch said: 'Angel was tragically killed in a terrible accident. She was very happy at home, she would bounce up and down on her trampoline. 'Angel was very clingy with me. She was a very good girl, good-natured and ate well. She was no trouble at all and got on well with all the family and her brother. 'Scott has been very affected - he says he is okay but I don't think that he is. I've told him it's not his fault it was an accident. He thinks I hate him but I don't. 'I'm devastated about what happened but I carry on for my son's sake. 'I cannot really describe how I have felt since the accident. We miss Angel so much and we will never forget her.'

Now, the cruel disease that has gripped several generations of Chris Graham's family has struck again. Mr Graham himself was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease at just 34. The ex-serviceman, now\u00a039, discovered in 2010 that he carries the same faulty gene that claimed the lives of his father, aunt, cousin and granddad, all in their 40s. This rare, inherited, or 'familial' form of Alzheimer's disease has also left his 43-year-old brother, Tony, bedbound in a care home and being fed through a tube. Scroll down for video . Chris Graham was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease at just 34. Several members of his family have been killed by the cruel, genetic form of the condition . Like his brother, Mr Graham carries a faulty version of PSEN-1 gene, which affects around 400 families worldwide. The father-of-three, from Carterton in Oxfordshire, is experiencing mild memory problems, but knows it is a case of when, not if, his dementia progresses. Although he is young, the disease process will affect him in the same way as the estimated 500,000 people with Alzheimer's in the UK. Mr Graham, who was medically discharged from the Army in January after 23 years' service, said: 'My friends didn't believe me when I told them I had Alzheimer's disease. 'At the age of 39, it just doesn't make sense to people: I'm fighting fit \u2013 how can I have something like that? We still think of Alzheimer's as a bit of forgetfulness as we get older. The truth is far worse.' He continued: 'My family has been hit hard by Alzheimer's. Dad died aged 42. He was in hospital so long I don't really remember him, I was only six or seven at the time. 'His sister, my aunt Thelma, died at 41 as she inherited the faulty gene too. I also lost a cousin, Thelma's daughter, at 41, and a granddad, Dad's father, at 46 to the disease.' This rare, inherited, or 'familial' form of Alzheimer's disease has also left his 43-year-old brother, Tony (pictured with his son), bedbound in a care home and being fed through a tube . The disease also claimed the life of Mr Graham's father. He said: 'My family has been hit hard by Alzheimer's. Dad died aged 42. He was in hospital so long I don't really remember him, I was only six or seven at the time' As one of four children, each of Mr Graham and his siblings had a 50/50 chance of inheriting the gene from their father. While his two sisters avoided the genetic curse, tragically, both he and his brother Tony have been struck by it. Speaking about his brother, who was diagnosed in 2006, said: 'He's in an old folk's home, he can't move and has to be fed through a tube. He can't speak but can raise a smile sometimes.' Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and is responsible for killing brain cells and shrinking the brain 400 per cent faster than the normal rate of ageing. Mr Graham is now taking part in research studies at University College London's Institute of Neurology to help scientists understand the earliest signs of Alzheimer's to boost the search for new treatments. He said:\u00a0'Although I know what will happen to me in the coming years, I now have direction in life. 'I wanted to do something to fight back against the disease \u2013 to do as much as I can while I can. It's simple for me, you have to hit the enemy directly, so I've taken on a challenge to help support research and I'm taking part in studies.' Now, to raise awareness of dementia and vital funds for Alzheimer's Research UK, Mr Graham is heading off on a 16,000 mile cycle ride around Canada and America in April. His year-long challenge has earned the support of Prime Minister David Cameron, who praised Mr Graham's 'extraordinary grit and determination' to raise money for the charity. Mr Graham said of his brother (pictured right with his own children): 'He's in an old folk's home, he can't move and has to be fed through a tube. He can't speak but can raise a smile sometimes'. Tony is pictured with his partner Jane . Now, to raise awareness of dementia and vital funds for Alzheimer's Research UK, Mr Graham is heading off on a 16,000 mile cycle ride around Canada and America in April . Mr Graham, who is also supporting ABF The Soldiers' Charity through his cycle ride, said:\u00a0'It's going to take me a year to do it, but I hope giving one of my good years to this challenge will help give many more good years to people with dementia. 'A cure may come too late for me, but it will help my kids. We've got man to the moon, so we'll get to the answers if we put enough into it. I hope what I'm doing will help inspire people to support Alzheimer's Research UK.' He is sharing his story in the same week a YouGov survey commissioned by Alzheimer's Research UK. Early onset Alzheimer's tends to cluster within families, sometimes with several generations affected, in which case it is called familial disease. In some of these cases, it is caused by mutations in one of three genes. People with any of these extremely rare mutations tend to develop Alzheimer's disease in their 30s or 40s. These genes, and the prevalence of their defective versions  is as follows: . These mutations are extremely rare and account for fewer than one in 1,000 cases of Alzheimer's disease. It is likely that all of those who inherit faulty versions of any of these three genes will develop Alzheimer's disease at a comparatively early age. On average, half of the children of a person with one of these rare genetic mutations will inherit the disease. People who do not inherit the mutation cannot pass it on. Someone who has two or more close relatives (a parent, brother or sister) who developed Alzheimer's disease before the age of 60, is advised to ask their GP about genetic testing and counselling for these rare mutations, who can also refer patients to a geneticist, if appropriate. Source: Alzheimer's Society . This revealed that, when asked what they think dementia is and who it affects, just 23 per cent of British adults specifically mentioned brain disease or degeneration, despite a previous survey from the charity showing more than one in three people know a close friend or family member with the condition. Hilary Evans, Director at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: 'Chris embodies everything that goes against the dementia stereotype \u2013 he's young and fit and his zest for life in the face of adversity is truly inspiring. 'Although Chris' form of Alzheimer's is rare, the tragic consequences it has had on his relatives will resonate with thousands of families across the UK who have experienced Alzheimer's. 'Chris' situation shows how profound the impact of Alzheimer's can be \u2013 this is not forgetfulness in old age, the disease is a destructive process that takes the ultimate toll. 'Our new survey data shows we have a long way to go in dementia education. We need to recognise the physical process of Alzheimer's \u2013 in doing so we'll see that there's something real we can attack and overcome with research. 'Until we do, our own misunderstanding or prejudice risks becoming the biggest barrier to research. Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'Alzheimer's is one of the key health challenges of this generation. 'Chris has my absolute backing as he undertakes this mammoth challenge in aid of Alzheimer's Research UK and ABF The Soldiers' Charity. 'Travelling unsupported on an expedition which will see him cycle 16,000 miles around the coastline of North America, Chris is a great example of someone who, when faced with a difficult diagnosis, has shown extraordinary grit and determination to overcome his circumstances and ensure that future generations can benefit from potentially life-saving research. 'These are important causes, and I urge everyone to get involved and support Chris as he sets off on this daunting, once-in-a-lifetime journey.'

Huskins' boyfriend Monday afternoon called police and said she had been abducted that morning from his home in the Bay Area. About 48 hours later, she was located an hour south of Los Angeles. Officers from the Huntington Beach Police Department found Huskins at her father's apartment complex, department spokeswoman Jennifer Marlatt told reporters. Huskins, 29, is in good condition and had no apparent injuries, Marlatt said. Huskins left with police to meet several family members. Vallejo police Lt. Kenny Park said that the case was being treated as a kidnap for ransom and investigators hoped to get a clearer picture of what happened by talking to Huskins later that night. It was unclear whether that would happen in Vallejo or whether detectives would have to travel to Huntington Beach, some 420 miles away. The San Francisco Chronicle reported that her father, Michael Huskins, said in a telephone interview that he received a voice mail from his daughter Wednesday morning saying she had been dropped off at his apartment. He called police to ask that the authorities pick her up and make sure she was safe, he told the newspaper. \"I almost had a heart attack,\" he said, according to the Chronicle. \"I tried to get authorities to pick her up, but they kept asking me a bunch of questions. I said, 'Send a squad car.' I was hyperventilating.\" Earlier, Michael Huskins had made an emotional appeal through CNN affiliate KGO-TV in San Francisco directed at the kidnappers: Don't hurt her, please don't hurt her.\" \"The biggest fear is the horror she might be going through ... that's my biggest fear. The horror, she doesn't deserve that, not from anybody.\" \"It's like a nightmare that I can't wake up from,\" her father told the affiliate. \"This is not supposed to happen.\" Police have not ruled anyone out as a potential suspect, Park told reporters. He declined to give much information about the case, including whether a ransom had been paid. He said he was unaware of any relationship between the man and woman. Park did say the man is both a witness and a \"potential victim.\" Michael Huskins has said the couple had been dating for seven months. When asked whether police have considered that this might not be a kidnapping, Park said: \"We're looking at all possible angles.\" The FBI is involved, he said. The Chronicle posted an audio clip on which Denise Huskins says she has been abducted. Her father confirmed the voice on the recording is hers. In it, she says: \"My name is Denise Huskins. I am kidnapped, otherwise I'm fine. Earlier today there was a plane crash in Alps and 158 people died. And one thing that people know about me is that I went to my first concert, me and my mom, to Blink 182 (last word is inaudible): . The editor in chief of the Chronicle, Audrey Cooper, said in a written statement that the newspaper received a link to the audio file in an email. The Chronicle reported the anonymous email said Huskins would be \"returned safely (Wednesday). We will send a link to her location after she has been dropped off.

Thomas Towle III, from Gardiner, Maine, admits he suffered an addiction to eating and only took stock when his doctor told him he faced an early death if he did not lose weight. After being a big child, he became even more overweight when he was a teenager and Towle was forced to drop out of high school when he became too embarrassed of his size, reports the Press Herald. Thomas Towle III, from Portland, (seen on right with a friend)\u00a0lost 500 pounds, but must now wear compression garments to stabilize all his excess skin . Towle admits he suffered an addiction to eating and only took stock when his doctor told him he faced an early death if he did not lose weight . 'I did an amazing job, I think, of putting a great face on, letting no one know how much being that heavy bothered me,' he said. At one point he weighed almost 800lbs. 'I made jokes at myself to survive. If someone was making fun of me, I made fun of myself harder. That way your jokes didn't hurt me, or at least you thought they didn't hurt me. Inside, it was a totally different story. It crushed me inside.' Towle tried several diets which all worked but as soon as he pulled back, he put the weight on again. He eventually began to lose weight when he got a job at McDonald's and he left the house and moved around more. He said that although he suffered pain in his joints from the excess weight they supported, he was able to sit down on a stool and serve customers. Towle and a friend fit now fit into the shirt he used to wear before he lost weight . He now weighs about 270 pounds, and is nearing his goal of getting below 250 pounds . 'I learned to work at McDonald's, and I lost weight,' he said. 'I was actually getting out of the house. Even though I might not have been standing up and doing exercise, I think the motion, the actual getting out, was a big first step in losing some of that weight.' He lost about 200 pounds through an improved diet and additional exercise, bringing him down to 600 pounds. Eventually Towle decided to have weight-loss surgery, although he had to lose another 50 pounds to be a safe weight to have the operation. In June 2011, Towle underwent gastric bypass surgery and a portion of his stomach was used to create a second smaller stomach. Towle can no longer eat some of his favorite foods as a result because they can make him vomit. He now weighs about 270 pounds, and is nearing his goal of getting below 250 pounds. But he has has to wear compression garments to stabilize all his excess skin. He says his faces a daily regime of three compression garments everyday as well as creams and powders to treat his extensive rashes and dry tearing skin. Towle needs reconstructive surgeries to remove the excess skin from his chest, abdomen and legs. The procedures are predicted to cost close to $30,000 and Towle thinks his insurance company will pay for at least a portion of the bill, but he is now appealing for help in paying the rest of it on his\u00a0Go Fund Me\u00a0page. He wrote: 'I am still trapped inside my own fat suit of skin that just hangs there and affects my everyday life, making it depressing to think I have come so far yet I am still trapped. 'I am asking you to please help me shed this one last obstacle in the way between me and a true new beginning a life that can be lived to the fullest.

Illegal immigrants and thieves are taking advantage, according to the SSA's Office of Inspector General. The IG set out to find out if death dates were being entered into computers for people who had 'exceeded maximum reasonable life expectancies.' If found millions who the government officially considered at least as old as the oldest living human currently alive. US Social Security numbers belonging to 6.5 million dead people were still listed as active \u2013 not deceased \u2013 when the Social Security Administration's inspector general investigated . YOUNG'UNS: Some of the still-active SSNs belonged to people who were born before teh US Civil War . Former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano launched the 'E-Verify' system in 2011, which screens out illegal immigrants during hiring, but some have been using still-valid SSNs belonging to dead Americans . Bureaucrats never added their Social Security Numbers to the government's 'Death Master File,' so it's possible benefits have been paid erroneously for decades. The Gerontology Research Group reported in October 2013 that there weer only 35 people on earth who were confirmed to be age 112 or older. The inspector general did not say how many benefit checks were sent to the 6.5 million Americans whose Social Security accounts should have been closed out years ago. But the IG's report, just one page in length confirms only that payments have been 'terminated' for 410,074 of the affected accounts. Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton told Daily Mail Online in a telephone interview that he was outraged by the possibility 'that there are dead people getting government checks.' 'Now we've got 6.5 million walking dead,' he said, 'and frankly \u2013 are these Zombie Americans voting? are they working? Are illegal immigrants using their SSNs to get jobs?' Indeed, 'thousands of the SSNs could have been used to commit identity fraud,' the inspector general's report concludes. 'We obtained information indicating a man opened bank accounts using several different Social Security numbers,' according to the IG, which said two of them belonged to people born in 1869 and 1893.' And between 2008 and 2011, employers trying to screen out illegal immigrants during hiring submitted 4,024 'E-Verify' requests to the federal government representing 3,873 people who used SSNs that belonged to people born before June 16, 1901. WIsconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson told CNS News that it's 'incredible that the Social Security Administration in 2015 does not have the technical sophistication to ensure that people they know to be deceased are actually noted as dead.' Johnson chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee. The committee's ranking Democrat, Delaware Sen. Tom Carper, noted that 'a few thousand' of the deceased people who still had active Social Security numbers were born before the Civil War. 'Preventing agency errors by keeping track of who has died is a relatively simple problem,' he said. 'WALKING DEAD': Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said the federal government si committing the same kind of fraud that would get banks shut down, by failing to ensure its money is spent wisely . IDENTITY FRAUD: Bureaucrats at the government benefits agency, located in Baltimore, Maryland, failed to enter Social Security numbers into the 'Master Death File' Fitton blamed the Obama administration, not just individual criminals, for the lapses. 'When you're an agency and you don't do what you need to do to make sure people aren't getting money they're not entitled to, that's fraud,' he said. 'If you were a bank and you didn't have the checks in place to make sure your money wasn't misused, you'd be shut down,' he said. 'Just ask HSBC what could happen. ... when government agencies do it, they're just told to clean up their act.' 'Social Security is on the verge of bankruptcy,' Fitton warned. 'Unless it's fixed the whole thing collapses. The last they could do is make sure that 6.5 million people who aren't entitled to benefits aren't getting checks.' 'And it's not the dead people who are cashing those checks,' he said.

But while these might look like unusually candid snaps of the Royal Family, in reality, they are a clever spoof created by artist Alison Jackson. Inspired by next week's Mothering Sunday, Jackson has tried to imagine how you might treat your mother when she happens to be the Queen. Giving the corgis a bath: Charles and Camilla give the Queen's corgis a bath in a lurid pink bathroom . And according to Jackson, that means hosing down the corgis and carefully giving boiled eggs a regal makeover, complete with bearskin and crown covers. The next photo shows Charles and Camilla, who, as a mother herself will be expecting some treats of her own next Sunday, bathing the corgis in a vivid pink bathroom before drying them off with a patriotic Union Flag towel. Amusingly, the royal couple are seen following the bath up with a blow dry, with Camilla grimacing as Prince Charles accidentally blows hot air in her face. Next comes the big reveal, with the Queen looking thrilled as she is presented with her breakfast tray, a card that reads 'Keep calm and reign on' and three pots of the Body Shop's Vitamin E moisture cream. Anyone for a blowdry? Charles' poor aim leaves Camilla needing to close her eyes . A card fit for a Queen: Prince Charles is seen filling in a card that bears the slogan: 'Keep calm and reign on' Decoration: Charles is also seen giving a trio of boiled eggs a regal makeover, complete with a crown . Finally, Her Majesty is seen sharing her toast soldiers and eggs with her freshly washed - and now very happy - corgis. Jackson is no stranger to reinventing the Royal Family, having previously worked on 'photos' of all the senior royals, including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Others to feature in her work include Pippa Middleton, who was the subject of her Christmas pastiche, which depicted Miss Middleton desperately attempting to wrap up a corgi for the Queen. More risqu\u00e9 depictions of the Royal Family include a photo of the Duchess of Cornwall on the treadmill clutching a gin and tonic and another of Camilla, this time smoking a cigarette. Doing the wrapping: A suited Charles and a dressing gowned Camilla wrap up their gifts for the Queen . Breakfast in bed: The Queen, clad in a fetching green nightie, looks delighted as she is given her breakfast . Some for you too: The freshly washed corgis are then shown getting to share Her Majesty's meal . One particularly amusing set claims to go behind the scenes of Prince George's 2013 Christening, with one photo showing the Queen looking horrified as her great grandson is sick on her. Others show a nude William and Kate in the bath with George and another in which the Duchess of Cambridge carefully changes her son's nappy.

Education Secretary Nicky Morgan insisted there was \u2018no alliance\u2019 between the two coalition parties at the coming election, and said the coalition had made it more difficult for both parties to keep their promises. She stressed that an outright Tory win was still possible - and preferable - but said the Tories would make a new deal with the Lib Dems work. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan suggested the Tories were ready to make a deal with the Lib Dems work . Mrs Morgan told the BBC\u2019s Question Time programme: \u2018I think if that\u2019s what the electorate presents us with I am sure we will try and make that work. I work with (Lib Dem schools minister) David Laws in the education department on a day by day basis.\u2019 Her comments are the clearest indication yet that the Tory leadership is laying the groundwork for a second deal with Nick Clegg if, as polls predict, the election produces another hung parliament. The move will prove hugely controversial with some senior Tories, who believe the party should try to go it alone in minority government if it emerges from the election as the largest party at Westminster, rather than accept the inevitable compromises of coalition.. London Mayor Boris Johnson told the Daily Mail last week that Mr Cameron should categorically rule out another deal with the Lib Dems. \u2018In my view we should say, \u201cstuff coalition with anyone\u201d, he said. \u2018We are there to win, we are there to offer leadership, we are there to be a Conservative government. \u2018If we go into this issuing faint pheremonal offerings or mating signals to this or that party it would be absolutely fatal.\u2019 It raises the prospect of a repeat of the scenes in May 2010 when David Cameron and Nick Clegg entered government together . Tory MP Peter Bone yesterday said Mrs Morgan was wrong to even countenance a second coalition with the Lib Dems. \u2018I don\u2019t agree with her \u2013 I think we should try with a minority government if we fall short,\u2019 he said. \u2018Nobody has said to me, in the thousands of doors I have knocked on, that they want another coalition government.\u2019 But a new poll of MPs conducted by Dods, suggested that almost half of Tory MPs (48 per cent) would prefer to have another coalition with the Lib Dems if the party fails to get a majority. Just 26 per cent said the party should rule out a coalition. Some 17 per cent said they would prefer a deal with Ukip. However, the survey found that just 29 per cent of Lib Dem MPs want to do another deal with the Tories, while 43 per cent would prefer a deal with Labour and 29 per cent would prefer to avoid any coalition at all. London Mayor Boris Johnson last week urged Mr Cameron to categorically rule out another deal with the Lib Dems . The right-wing Spectator magazine reported this week that Mr Cameron has already begun private discussions about forming a second coalition with Mr Clegg. It said it was aware of \u2018at least two detailed discussions that Cameron has had on the topic in recent weeks. He said the same in both \u2013 no matter what they might hear to the contrary, he does not want to run a minority government.\u2019 However, the annual British Social Attitudes Report found little enthusiasm for another five years of coalition, despite broad acceptance for many of the current Government's reforms.

David Adams, 25, had been charged with assault and child endangerment in November after acknowledging having shaken Thaiya Spruill-Smith, according to the authorities. He had recently been released from prison after four when his family posted a bail bond but he was rearrested on Wednesday after the Brooklyn district attorney upgraded the charges against him, according to the New York Times. Yesterday he appeared in Brooklyn Criminal Court on a charge of second-degree murder. He hung his head during his 15 minute appearance. Assistant district attorney Frank DeGaetano said in court: 'He shook her several times. Thaiya Spruill-Smith, two, was taken off life support after suffering a brain hemorrhage. Stepfather David Adams, 25, has now been charged with her murder . 'He made her hit her head. She had multiple abrasions and contusions, 17 on her head, and she had damage to the axons and neurons in her brain consistent with massive brain damage.' Thaiya had been declared brain-dead in November after Adams said he shook her and she was admitted to a hospital with bleeding in the brain, retinal hemorrhaging and bruises. The incident leading to Thaiya's death occurred on November 12 when her mum Teoka Spruill left her Brooklyn apartment for about an hour, leaving Thaiya with Adams. According to a criminal complaint, Adams told police he held Thaiya off the ground, causing her head 'to rotate forward and back rapidly several times,' and the girl's body then went limp. He again shook her, so hard her head swiveled again several times, and then her body went rigid. Thaiya was asleep when Ms Spruill returned, she said,\u00a0and the child woke once during the night to ask for juice. Ms Spruill called an ambulance next morning when she heard Thaiya struggling for breath. The youngster was rushed to Brookdale Hospital shortly before 7am and despite numerous operations, doctors concluded her injuries were too severe to overcome and she was eventually taken off life support. It has since emerged that Thaiya may have been the victim of months of abuse at the hands of Adams that was investigated by New York City social services. Ms Spruill and Thaiya's father Terrell Smith disagreed over whether to donate her organs after the toddler was declared brain dead two days after the incident. A judge ordered Brookdale  to keep the child on life support for at least another day to keep her organs alive until the girl's parents resolved their dispute. 'She was born with that, she's going to be buried with that, her body, her eyes - it's what makes her her,' Smith told the\u00a0New York Times from Thaiya's hospital bed in Brookdale Hospital, New York. Thaiya's father Terrell Smith says she was being systematically abused by her mother's new husband . 'My daughter was born with that, and she's going to lie down with the same thing.' Speaking separately, Spruill told the paper: 'I just think it would be a blessing for someone else's family.' As organ and tissue donation can only occur when there is agreement among family members, it was eventually ruled Thaiya's organs would not be donated. The parental dispute is reportedly the latest in a series spanning Thaiya's lifetime, as Smith claims he made repeated attempts to save her from Adams, who he claims was abusive. Relatives made emotional tributes to the 'smart' and 'sweet' girl at the time of Adams' first appearance in court. 'Thai, she was like the sweetest little girl ever, like you wouldn't have problems with her ever,' Shayne Smith, Thaiya's uncle, told Time Warner Cable. 'She was very smart - very, very smart.' According to court documents, Adams admitted to shaking Thaiya when questioned. And police sources say there are records of a similar shaking incident in the household last month. At his first appearance Adams, who married Thaiya's mother in March, wept before prosecutors in court as they told him the two-year-old had died. 'He was shocked. He was very, very upset,' defense attorney Joseph Sieger told the New York Post. Smith said social services took custody of the little girl for a week while they investigated Adams for abuse. She was returned and the case was dropped, he said.

Subject to an appeal in Melbourne on Thursday, he will win that right - a decision that could even mark the end of Sauber\u2019s participation in the sport after 22 years. This pickle came about after Sauber seemingly reneged on a contract that said Van der Garde would race for them this season. They instead hired two drivers, Brazilian Felipe Nasr and Sweden\u2019s Marcus Ericsson, who between them bring \u00a320million to the team. But Van der Garde went to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, clutching his contract. Dutch driver Giedo van der Garde has taken Sauber to court claiming his right to drive for the team . They found in his favour, a ruling that was upheld by the Supreme Court of Victoria here on Wednesday. Sauber decided to appeal, the result of which is expected on Thursday. The team\u2019s lawyers argued that - only days away from this weekend\u2019s race - installing a different driver was an unacceptable safety risk. They said the cars had been fitted to the specifications of Nasr and Ericsson. Rodney Garratt QC told the court that the absence of the correct seatbelt meant Van der Garde could not compete safely given the 210mph speed of the cars and g-forces \u2018up to five times their bodyweight\u2019. In truth, Sauber\u2019s argument was melodramatic rubbish. Even if they need to make some late changes, why is it less safe to let Van der Garde drive than Roberto Merhi, who was only named as Manor\u2019s driver on Tuesday? Merhi has never driven the Manor car. Nobody has. It only passed its crash test last week. Sauber's Marcus Ericsson (left) and Filipe Nasr wait to se if they will drive in Melbourne this weekend . And Van Der Garde, 29, was even Sauber\u2019s test driver last year. They know his measurements. No, Sauber cannot afford to drop Nasr, who is backed by Banco do Brasil, or Ericsson, who brings in a sponsorship package worth \u00a310million. Much of the pair\u2019s money has been paid up front. Those backers would not react kindly to being told their man is suddenly out of a job. One solution would be Van der Garde agreeing to receive compensation, but it is said he would prefer to get the drive rather than the money. However, even this is illogical because without Sauber\u2019s two high-paying drivers the whole team could be forced into administration, meaning therefore, he would have nobody to drive for.", "reference": "Fernando Alonso could race again in Malaysia a fortnight on Sunday .\nMcLaren chairman Ron Dennis said sorry for his comments about Alonso\u2019s condition following his crash in Barcelona on February 22 .\nDennis erroneously said Alonso wasn't concussed in the testing accident .\nGiedo van der Garde's claim to drive for Sauber could end the team .\nFelipe Nasr and Marcus Ericsson wait to see if they'll drive in Melbourne .\nAustralian Grand Prix kicks off the 2015 Formula One season on Sunday ."}, "430": {"id": "4476ea6a3cc1233e05da9993f1da2f040cbeb4f5", "article": "Wales boss Warren Gatland has warned his players not to get \u2018caught with their pants down\u2019 in Rome after their famous victory over Ireland set up a final-round decider against Italy. Having edged out their round-four tie at the Millennium Stadium, Gatland\u2019s side are still in the hunt for the championship but they must better the points difference of both England and Ireland to top the standings. Wales have won their last seven meetings against the Azzuri, however they will have to prepare for the tie at the Stadio Olimpico with major fitness concerns over Jamie Roberts, Richard Hibbard, Gethin Jenkins and Samson Lee.

Italy are not a bad side. It\u2019s important to do a job up front and accumulate points. \u2018It could come down to the last 15 or 20 minutes. It will be nice to go there and get a win and hopefully win by a few. We\u2019re first up at the weekend so we\u2019ll see how the other teams react afterwards. It puts us under some pressure but hopefully it puts England and Ireland under some pressure too.\u2019 England face a potential banana-skin tie against France, while Ireland have a trip to wooden spoon favourites Scotland. Like Gatland, Ireland coach Joe Schmidt will also approach the closing weekend with caution. The Kiwi coach found himself in a similar situation 12 months ago, when he pipped the English to the title with a dramatic victory at the Stade de France.

Scotland are going to be very difficult to beat.\u2019 Last night\u2019s defeat in Cardiff was not how Paul O\u2019Connell hoped to celebrate his 100th Test.

The Bethnal Green Academy pupils are feared to have reached the conflict zone to become so-called 'jihadi brides' with ISIS. Scroll down for video . Anguish: The families of three missing London schoolgirls have travelled to Turkey to retrace their steps . Questions: The families hope\u00a0to find clues that may help them find or even contact their daughters . Emotional: The families went to the Istanbul coach station where the teenagers boarded their bus to Syria . On the journey, their families went first to the Istanbul coach station where the teenagers waited 18 hours in the biting February chill for their bus to the Syrian border. There they spoke to a man who unknowingly let the girls in. He told ITV News they were\u00a0'smiling as they arrived' and 'smiling as they left'. Renu Begum, sister of Shamima, told ITV News: 'This is our next step basically to get the message out to them that we've followed them all the way out here. We want them to know that we love them.' Halima Khanom, sister of Kadiza, said: 'I don't really recognise my sister, the video and the CCTV that we saw. Because this is just not her and we just want to understand her, you know, to find some answers and get some help.' Abase Hussein, father of Amira, said: 'I don't know how to explain. I can't describe my feelings. I feel like my girl is next to me when I find someone that's on their last journey who saw them. I feel like my daughter is next to me - that's the feelings I have.' Searching for clues: At the bus station, the family spoke to a man who unknowingly let the three girls in . Tears: The families struggle to hide their emotions as they retraced the steps of the London schoolgirls . The families left through the same door as the girls at the bus station, and family lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said: 'Of course they feel responsible for their own children, that goes without saying. 'But the fact is these girls were school children and much of what took place clearly took place at school. Police put a cap on information that they and the school were giving back to the parents.' The east London schoolgirls flew to Istanbul from Gatwick with Turkish Airlines and now believed to be in based in the Syrian town of Raqqa \u2013 the Islamic State's self-declared capital. Last week it emerged that\u00a0Sharmeena Begum, 15, a close friend of the trio and a fellow pupil at Bethnal Green Academy, left Britain before them in December. There are suspicions the trio kept in touch with Sharmeena who passed on information about how to follow in her footsteps. Those closest to all four girls suspect they were groomed by Islamists using social networking sites and secretive internet messaging software. The families have criticised police and others for failing to stop them. But their\u00a0plight has raised questions about why the families themselves did not spot their conversion to radical Islam. Scotland Yard chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has said the three schoolgirls would not face prosecution if they returned home. Familiar route: The families, along with ITV's Rohit Kachroo, flew in to Istanbul from Gatwick . Looking for answers: By retracing the route of the schoolgirls, the families hope it might bring them home . Elsewhere last week, three British teenage jihadists were placed in custody after a dramatic security operation prevented them joining ISIS in Syria. A pair of 17-year-old schoolboys and a 19-year-old man, all from North-West London, were intercepted in Turkey after their parents realised they had fled to join the terrorist group. They dialled 999 and British police quickly tipped off their Turkish counterparts. Officials swooped on the group within minutes of their flight touching down in Istanbul. Security services say 600 British Muslims have gone to fight in Syria and around 60 of them are young women. They include 22 women and girls who have travelled in the past 12 months, many of whom wanted to become 'jihadi brides'. ISIS currently controls a swath of land slightly larger than the UK, from Aleppo to central Iraq, and has attracted thousands of foreign fighters to its cause.

Alex Salmond was ridiculed last night after he boasted of becoming Westminster\u2019s king- maker while quaffing pink champagne and saying that he \u2018identifies\u2019 with Nelson Mandela. Seemingly still unable to come to terms with his referendum defeat, the former First Minister continued to overshadow his successor Nicola Sturgeon with a self-regarding interview for New Statesman magazine. Before a vote has even been cast in the General Election, he predicted the stars will be in \u2018alignment\u2019 for his triumphant return to Westminster as power broker, and vowed to crowbar Ed Miliband into No 10. Mr Salmond also said he would make it impossible for David Cameron to govern if the Conservative leader fails to secure a majority in May\u2019s election. Last night, Tory MSP Alex Johnstone said: \u2018Nicola Sturgeon must wish that Alex Salmond would just shut up.\u2019 Earlier this year, Miss Sturgeon slapped down her predecessor by insisting that she would lead any post-election negotiations at Westminster. But Mr Salmond continued to publicise his plans yesterday, claiming he would join forces with Labour to \u2018lock out\u2019 the Tories by voting down any attempt by Mr Cameron to pass a Queen\u2019s Speech. Scottish Labour Party chairman Jamie Glackin said: \u2018You\u2019d be forgiven for thinking he was still leader of the SNP.\u2019 The New Statesman article reveals how, during the interview in London, Mr Salmond ordered pink champagne to toast the launch of his widely mocked referendum diaries, accompanying it with fish, chips and mushy peas. Asked by the magazine which \u2018historical figure\u2019 he identified with, he replied: \u2018Nelson Mandela. Everybody of my generation would say that.\u2019 Mr Johnstone said: \u2018Alex Salmond is fast becoming a figure of ridicule. This bizarre comment suggests that the former First Minister has unhinged himself from reality completely.\u2019 The Tory MSP said the interview was \u2018yet more evidence that Alex Salmond is a backseat driver, with Nicola Sturgeon looking on from Edinburgh wondering where the car is going\u2019. Tory MSP Alex Johnstone (right) said new SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon (left) 'must wish that Alex Salmond would just shut up' Scottish Labour director of policy Blair McDougall said: \u2018Pink champagne? Lah-di-dah! I\u2019m sure the First Minister is really relaxed about Salmond\u2019s boozy lunches with London journalists.\u2019 Tory sources last night said that Mr Salmond\u2019s comments showed the SNP was prepared to \u2018sabotage\u2019 the outcome of the election in order to put Labour leader Mr Miliband in Downing Street. Senior Tories are considering plans to run a minority government if the Conservatives emerge as the largest party in a hung parliament. But Mr Salmond said the (Fixed-term) Parliaments Act, which was passed by the Coalition, meant that the SNP could put Labour into power even if the Conservatives win more seats. He said the SNP \u2013 on course for an election landslide in Scotland \u2013 would not contemplate any deal with the Tories. Asked about the prospect of a minority Tory government, Mr Salmond replied: \u2018The Tories would have to go straight effectively for a vote of confidence, usually the Queen\u2019s Speech, although it could be otherwise, of course, and we\u2019d be voting against.

Yes.\u2019 Source: The New Statesman . \u2018So if Labour joins us in that pledge, then that\u2019s Cameron locked out. And then under the (Fixed-term) Parliaments Act that Westminster passed but nobody seems to have read, you\u2019d then have a two-week period to form another government \u2013 and of course you want to form another government because this might be people\u2019s only chance to form another government.\u2019 He said it was a \u2018fib\u2019 spread by Labour that the party with the most seats automatically won the right to try to form a government \u2013 pointing out that Labour\u2019s first government in 1924 was formed after it came second. A spokesman for the Conservatives said: \u2018Alex Salmond has confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister. \u2018That would mean chaos for Britain, with weak Ed Miliband dancing to Alex Salmond\u2019s tune. The only way to protect Trident, keep Britain together and safeguard the economy is to vote Conservative.\u2019 The former leader of the SNP said he indentifies with former South African president and anti-apartheid revolutionary Nelson Mandela (pictured) Mr Miliband moved to quell Labour panic in Scotland last week by ruling out a formal coalition with the SNP. But the UK Labour leader has refused to rule out a looser power-sharing deal. The SNP has made it clear it would extract a ruinously high price in return for propping up Mr Miliband in office, including \u00a3180billion of extra borrowing, ditching Britain\u2019s Trident nuclear deterrent and insisting on sweeping new powers for the Scottish parliament that would leave the country reliant on dwindling North Sea oil revenues. Mr Salmond said the SNP would amend any Labour budget to introduce \u2018progressive tax rises\u2019 \u2013 likely to raise fears of big tax hikes for the middle classes. He also dismissed Labour suggestions it would not cut a deal with the SNP. He said the party would face a stark choice between doing a deal with the SNP, or allowing Mr Cameron to stay on as Prime Minister. Mr Salmond is favourite to win the Lib Dem-held seat of Gordon at the election. He is likely to return to Westminster as the effective head of the largest ever grouping of Nationalist MPs. He has also predicted that his party will oust both Labour\u2019s election co-ordinator Douglas Alexander and the Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander from their Scottish constituencies.", "reference": "Former SNP leader Alex Salmond\u00a0is accused of being a 'back seat\u00a0driver'\nIt comes after he\u00a0vowed to crowbar Ed Miliband into No 10 in May election .\nHe  predicted the stars will be in 'alignment' for his return to Westminster .\nSalmond also 'identified' with  anti-apartheid revolutionary Nelson Mandela .\nTory MSP Alex Johnstone warned he was\u00a0becoming\u00a0a 'figure of ridicule'"}, "433": {"id": "85bc1b8c9b6e973cae4c0251de9cbf4db8a94410", "article": "After months of speculation and suspense, Netflix has finally announced it's launch date for Australia and New Zealand.

Just last week a consumer advocacy group slammed new proposals to reduce online piracy as 'truly frightening' Piracy levels hit a peak last year when 1.5 million people downloaded the season finale of Game of Thrones . Just last week a consumer advocacy group slammed new proposals to reduce online piracy as 'truly frightening', as its revealed they could expose Australian internet users to unlimited damages payout to Hollywood studios. Under the new Copyright Notice Scheme Industry Code, anyone with an internet connection could potentially face legal threats from Hollywood studios for illegally downloading movies, TV shows, and music. Consumer group Choice labelled the plan, which was compiled by Australia's largest internet service providers (ISP's) at the request of the federal government, as 'medieval' and said it 'reads like a horror movie script'. The scheme could come into affect as soon as September this year. Under the proposed code, a three-strikes system would be introduced for illegal downloads. Customers suspected of illegally downloading content will be sent a series of notices from their ISP's - a warning, an 'education' notice, and a final notice. 'The code means that anyone with an internet connection could be under threat from legal action. Often consumers share with flatmates, partners, or family, which means that even those who don't download illegally could be taken to court,' Ms Turner told Daily Mail Australia. Foxtel has exclusive rights to the fantasy series leading to criticism by consumer groups . 55% of Australians who downloaded content illegally, including Breaking Bad spin-off Better Call Saul (above)  said it was because of a lack of access . The Communications Alliance, the industry body backing the proposed code,\u00a0released a statement last week emphasising the 'public education' elements of the code, but noted that the scheme did provide a process of 'facilitated preliminary discovery'. In Australia, piracy levels hit a peak last year when 1.5 million people downloaded the season finale of Game of Thrones. Unlike in New Zealand, Australia has no limit to fines under the Copyright Act, and it is up to the judge's discretion as to what the consumer is fined. Choice has been vocal about providing consumers with a greater range of legal options to download the content they are seeking so that they don't resort to illegal content. 'We did a survey last year which found that a third of Australians download illegally, and more watch the illegal content,' said Ms Turner. 'When we asked people the reason they downloaded, 55% said it was because of a lack of access, and that they had first tried to obtain the content through legal sources,' she said. Ms Turner said that 55% of those that downloaded illegally had tried to obtain content through legal sources . 'Consumers find it very frustrating when they know the content is online, but that they are blocked from accessing it. It makes very little sense to them.' The code indicates that rights holders need to be working towards initiatives which 'include continuing efforts of Rights Holders to ensure timely and ready availability to Australian consumers of lawful content alternatives.' However, Ms Turner said that while it was fantastic to see new streaming service such as Stan available in Australia, the country was still very behind the kind of access others around the world enjoyed. Choice is calling on Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull to intervene and ensure proper protection for consumers under the code, and have launched a campaign\u00a0urging him to take responsibility for the internet policy.", "reference": "News ends months of speculation about highly-anticipated service .\nCompany will bring a \u00a0host of original new series to Australian TV .\nAustralians among top illegal downloaders because of availability delays .\nLast month a new plan to combat online piracy was announced .\nConsumer group Choice slammed the scheme calling it 'medieval'"}, "434": {"id": "c7a7cca7245080900ec9c2b75b21eaaeeadab9db", "article": "Jordon Ibe is hoping to make a timely return to Liverpool's squad before the end of the season after stepping up his rehabilitation from a knee ligament injury.

Mrs Fairhead claimed repeatedly that she had not been aware of any wrongdoing and that she had relied on various committees and structures to flag up problems. But MPs said her performance at the bank was not good enough \u2013 raising serious questions over whether she is suitable for her BBC role. Committee chairman Margaret Hodge said: \u2018I really do think you should consider your position and consider resigning and if not, the Government should sack you. Either you knew or you didn\u2019t know \u2013 and I think in that case that you are either incredibly naive or totally incompetent. \u2018I don\u2019t think that the performance you\u2019ve shown here, and your record as a guardian of HSBC give me confidence that you should be the guardian of the licence fee.\u2019 Labour MP Mrs Hodge added: I\u2019ve met you once and I like you but I don\u2019t think you are fit for the job\u2026 I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve lost my trust.\u2019 Mrs Fairhead has already come under considerable pressure over potential conflicts between her multiple jobs, since she started as chairman of the BBC Trust last September. Committee chairman Margaret Hodge said Ms Fairhead had lost her trust, but Tory committee member Stephen Hammond disagreed with the call for her to resign . In addition to the \u00a3110,000-a-year position, on which she spends three days a week, she is a non-executive director of Pepsi and HSBC. Last year she received more than \u00a3513,000 in fees and benefits for her work at the troubled bank, including a \u00a3334,000 fee as non-executive chairman of HSBC North America Holdings. Yesterday, MPs marvelled at the fact that she is paid so much, but did not do more to find out about HSBC\u2019s alleged efforts to help tax evaders. Mrs Fairhead was one of a panel of HSBC bosses hauled in front of the committee who spent the session trying to blame others for the tax evasion scandal at its division in Switzerland. Leaked files showed that more than 1,000 people from the UK had secret accounts at HSBC\u2019s Swiss bank, including a number of Tory donors. The Public Accounts Committee of MPs was taking on\u00a0Tax avoidance and evasion: HSBC in Parliament . But she argued that the chief culprits were those who had evaded tax and people on the front line, rather than the non-executive directors. \u2018We relied on three layers of board oversight and multiple layers of executive oversight to raise issues of material importance to the audit committee,\u2019 Mrs Fairhead said. \u2018We were reliant on [reports from] specialists\u2026 It wasn\u2019t flagged so you\u2019ve got to ask, \u201cWhat more can you do?\u2019\u2019\u2019 MPs responded that the BBC Trust chief sounded too \u2018passive\u2019, and accused the wider HSBC board of \u2018extraordinary\u2019 blindness. Last week Mrs Fairhead told a conference that she would prioritise her job at the BBC Trust over her other positions, and that she was keeping her roles on the HSBC and Pepsi boards \u2018under review\u2019. She also took the unusual step of recommending that the BBC Trust should be abolished.

The biggest lesson may simply to be grateful for our rights and privileges. That includes the little things we take for granted. Like a small plastic card that not only allows us to drive on public roadways but also provides us a sense of identity. Imagine not having a driver's license and not being able to obtain one because the government prohibits it. Erika Andiola doesn't have to imagine. Until recently, the 27-year-old Phoenix resident and co-director of the Arizona Dream Coalition was barred from having a driver's license by Arizona. The reason: she is an undocumented immigrant born in Mexico and brought here as a child by her mother. Given that she arrived in the United States when she was 11 and has lived on this side of the U.S.-Mexico border longer than she lived on the other side, Andiola considers herself an American and this country her home. Under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which was initiated by the Obama administration, more than half a million undocumented youth were given a two-year reprieve from deportation and a work permit. Andiola is one of the recipients, having been granted DACA protection in November 2012 and a renewal since then. From that point, had she lived in another state, the process for getting a driver's license might have been much smoother. But she lives in Arizona, which -- in the 20 years from 1989 to 2009 -- welcomed illegal immigrants and their labor to build homes in Phoenix, work in restaurants in Tucson and make beds at ski lodges in Flagstaff but then tried to expel them when their chores were done. To push them out the door, legislators passed a spiteful law in 2010 that roped local police into enforcing federal immigration statutes and essentially sanctioned ethnic profiling of Latinos. In August 2012, on the same day that DACA took effect, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer issued an executive order preventing the program's recipients from obtaining driver's licenses or other public \"benefit.\" Brewer's order was challenged in court. Two years later, in July 2014, a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the Arizona policy as a violation of the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. With that, the estimated 22,000 DACA recipients who are also residents of the Grand Canyon State were free to apply for driver's licenses and take their driving tests like anyone else. Andiola got her Arizona license earlier this month, after paying a $25 fee that she'll have to pay every two years each time she renews it. I wondered what traveling that road taught her about that piece of plastic she carries with her. And I was curious about whether she had given any thought to how the native-born see driver's licenses compared to people like her. \"There is a pretty big difference,\" Andiola said. \"I think it's because we fought really hard for it. People born here might not ever think about their driver's license unless they buy a drink or get stopped by police. For us, it's a reminder of the fruits of our labor. Think about how many minds we had to change so people could come out of the shadows.\" Other privileges get taken for granted by the native-born, she said, such as the ability to apply for financial aid to attend college or pay the lower in-state tuition that you're entitled to pay as a state resident. \"When it comes to higher education, I don't think a lot of people really understand what they have unless they have to struggle to get it,\" Andiola said. \"I have nephews who are citizens. I'm trying to make them understand how it was such a big deal, in my case, to attend college and pay in-state tuition and have it taken away. It was a big hurdle, and I almost dropped out. I want them to understand some of the privileges they have.\" Finally, there's the right to vote. Undocumented immigrants can't do it, and yet many of those U.S. citizens who can don't bother going to the polls. \"Look at what we've done to bring change,\" she said. \"Imagine how much someone can accomplish when they vote. A lot of Americans don't learn the political process. And you don't feel you need to until you struggle to drive, to vote, to just be allowed to stay with your family.\" Listen to her, America. This is an exemplary country, and it'll stay that way as long as those of us who were born here and have these rights and privileges learn to appreciate them, treat them with care and put them to good use.", "reference": "Ruben Navarrette: A driver's license is not only about transportation but about identity .\nHe says it took a hard fight for young immigrants to win the right to driver's licenses in Arizona ."}, "438": {"id": "3a57581cd30e2f7f6fa6a78d50e759a69e8c92bb", "article": "Scotland\u2019s title winners were handed a new incentive to reach the Promised Land of the Champions League after UEFA confirmed large increases in the cash sums on offer. Champions for the last three season, Celtic earned \u00a312.6million for reaching the group stage and winning one of their six matches in 2013/14. The same performance next season would bring in at least \u00a316m under the new figures announced by Europe\u2019s governing body \u2014 and that does not include ticket sales. Confirming the cash \u2018cycle\u2019 for the next three years, UEFA will also seek to narrow the gap between the cash available to Champions League and Europa League clubs. A Scottish club participating in the group stage of the junior competition now stands to make in excess of \u00a34m. Significantly, however, the three Scottish clubs that enter the Europa League qualifiers will now cover their costs via a solidarity payment of \u00a3150,000 \u2013 even if they crash out at the first hurdle. Celtic failed to make the Champions League this season, crashing out to Maribor in the qualifiers . Craig Gordon saves against Inter Milan in the last 32 Europa League clash at the San Siro . Celtic line up against Inter  but the Parkhead club will be greedy for the Champions League rewards . Yet, the Europa League remains very much the lesser of UEFA\u2019s tournaments and Ronny Deila, who failed to navigate Celtic to the Champions League this season, will now come under increasing pressure to deliver qualification \u2013 and bigger rewards - this summer. Currently top of the league table and chasing four-in-a-row, the Parkhead side can expect to make over \u00a310m if they retain their title and reach next season\u2019s group stage \u2013 even if they fail to win a point - an increase from \u00a36.4m. Broadcasting pool revenues will also rise while the prize for a win will increasing to \u00a31.1m and a draw will bring in \u00a3362,000. The rewards for reaching the last 16 \u2013 as Celtic did most recently in 2012 \u2013 will now leap by a whopping \u00a34m. The biggest winners \u2013 as always \u2013 will be the English Premier League clubs with their huge broadcasting pool. If an English side were to win next season\u2019s Champions League, they would earn around \u00a374m from central UEFA funds alone. Yet what is good for the elite \u2014 and what is good for Celtic \u2014 is not necessarily good for Scottish football. Most \u2013 outwith Aberdeen - assume the Parkhead side will retain their title at the end of this campaign and will have another crack at the Euro elite. Becoming champions of Scotland is no guarantee of Champions League participation, of course, yet the prospect of a \u00a316m-\u00a320m windfall is a strong incentive to get it right this time. For Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell, it\u2019s an imperative. The fear is that more UEFA cash only widens the gap between the aristos and the proletariat. Not only in Europe, but in countries like Scotland where more European money allows Celtic to lord it while the others eat cake. Giorgios Samaras scores in the Nou Camp for Celtic in their 6-1 loss in the 2013 group stages . Celtic enjoyed a glamour tie against AC Milan in the group stages of the 2013 Champions League instalment . UEFA said the changes are a bid to address this, to narrow the gap between the elite competition and the Europa League \u2014 the level SPFL clubs realistically aspire to \u2014 with general secretary Gianni Infantino insisting: \u2018UEFA is really pleased that the new distribution system not only provides for a substantial rise in monies received by clubs participating in the Champions League and Europa League but also strengthens UEFA\u2019s solidarity principle, namely ensuring an even more substantial increase in solidarity payments to clubs. \u2018In this way, the new system provides a better deal for everyone, especially those clubs which did not qualify to the group stage of either of the two UEFA club competitions. This is a perfect example of the proper implementation of the solidarity principle which forms an essential part of UEFA\u2019s key values.\u2019 For every pound UEFA give to clubs in the Europa League currently Champions League clubs receive \u00a34.30. From next season that ratio will narrow. Crucially, where clubs like Aberdeen, Inverness, St Johnstone or Dundee United are concerned, there will also be the new solidarity payments for those who crash out of the Europa League at the qualifying stage. This has long been the norm for Scottish clubs, their pain heightened by the cost of flying to far-flung remote outposts in Russia, Belarus or Moldova. Potentially very good for Celtic, then, UEFA's announcement should also make European football more appealing and rewarding to those further down the food chain. Charles Barnett, partner of the Sports Group of BDO, told Sportsmail: \u2018What UEFA are saying is that from next season the revenues from the two competitions will be put into one pot and distributed to all the clubs participating. \u2018So there is more money going to the Europa League and, let\u2019s be honest, when you are thinking about Scottish clubs now that\u2019s what you are really talking about. \u2018There is more money now coming into the Europa League and more potentially available to Scotland\u2019s participants via solidarity payments if they don\u2019t make it to the group stage. \u2018In the Champions League, which might affect Celtic, they are going up 60 per cent. \u2018But more pertinent to Scotland is the fact that solidarity payments for failing to reach the Europa League will be higher. \u2018What that should ensure is an end to the scenario where Scottish teams knocked out in the early qualifying rounds of the Europa League lose money when they are sent to the furthest corner of Eastern Europe. \u2018Some Scottish clubs like Motherwell have lost money spending fortunes chartering planes. \u2018To make \u00a3150,000 just for getting knocked out in the first qualifier plus revenue from the home tie should cover the costs of the away leg.\u2019 That covering the costs of defeat has become a Scots priority is mildly depressing. Yet Celtic used the Europa League group stage as a parachute after Champions League failure last season. And, as Barnett explained: \u2018The group stage of the Europa League will also offer a substantial increase of 65 per cent. Participation could see clubs make \u00a34m now.\u2019 For Rangers, much of this will be a source of anguish. With a stated goal of competing with Celtic as soon as possible, the gap becomes more and more difficult to bridge every year their rivals win the Scottish title and have another crack at the Champions League. On a day they announced more financial losses, the Ibrox board \u2013 and others around the country - can see just how difficult it will be to challenge the Parkhead side as the country\u2019s dominant force. Barnett argues differently, however, and added: \u2018Celtic could make \u00a33m to \u00a34m for reaching the group stage and for a club like Celtic, playing in Scotland, that is big money. \u2018But that barely pays for another striker, never mind his wages. It could affect competition if they were winning the league and qualifying season after season after season, but will that really destroy competition? I\u2019m not sure. \u2018It\u2019s good to see, but I\u2019m not sure it will widen the gulf in Scottish football. \u2018If anything, we will see other Scottish clubs earn more cash via the Europa League and, therefore, the teams finishing second, third and fourth in the SPFL Premiership have more opportunity to earn more money. \u2018We are talking about more money being made available to clubs that don\u2019t make it into any competition.\u2019", "reference": "Celtic earned \u00a312.6million for reaching the group stage and winning one of their six matches in 2013/14 .\nThe same performance next season would bring in at least \u00a316m .\nUEFA will also seek to narrow the gap between the cash available to Champions League and Europa League clubs .\nA Scottish club participating in the group stage of the junior competition now stands to make in excess of \u00a34m ."}, "439": {"id": "65e49bc70c0d30a01c7cf3d6dcf681ae484c4884", "article": "Coalition ministers are at war over Tory plans to ban hate preachers from English universities. David Cameron wants a total campus ban on extremists whose twisted views risk radicalising impressionable youngsters.

The row follows the unmasking of Islamic State murderer Jihadi John as Mohammed Emwazi who is believed to have been radicalised while studying at Westminster University. Home Secretary Theresa May wants tougher rules on campuses but Business Secretary Vince Cable warns it could force debates 'underground', where extreme views will go unchallenged . Security experts believe the freedom of extremists to operate at college campuses is a significant factor in the radicalisation of some young people. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps yesterday said Mr Cable, who has responsibility for universities, was wrong to resist the move. \u2018Vince Cable doesn\u2019t want to do what the Conservatives want to do, which is to make sure that on campus we do not have radical preachers saying things which incite violence which ultimately can lead to the radicalisation of young people,\u2019 he told Sky News. \u2018We have to put proper, decent, tough rules in place which don\u2019t ban free speech, but do prevent people from preaching death.\u2019 Lib Dem energy secretary Ed Davey said it was \u2018easy to demolish\u2019 the views of hate preachers if they were debated in public and warned that driving them underground would only increase their appeal. \u2018If these preachers are inciting violence, if they are saying it is OK to be a terrorist, if they are saying you can cut off people\u2019s heads, they can and should be arrested,\u2019 he said.

Four out of five British cider makers would be put out of business after a new ruling by the European Commission. The UK government was formally told last week to change its current excise duty, which means cider makers that produce less than 70 hectolitres (12,000 pints) a year do not have to pay duty. Changes to the 39-year-old exemption is likely to affect 80 per cent of Britain's 480 cider and perry makers, according to the National Association of Cider Makers (NACM). In a statement, the European Commission, said it was 'unanimously agreed' that the UK excise duty scheme contravenes EU legislation. It said: 'EU excise duty rules oblige Member States to levy an excise duty on alcohol and alcoholic beverages. 'There are no provisions which would provide for an exception to the general obligation to levy excise duty in respect of cider and perry made for sale by small domestic producers.' David Kaspar runs a small apple juice, cider and perry business in Brookthorpe, Gloucestershire, and makes under 170 hectolitres of cider from the 16 acre orchard to sell at markets and a pub. He told the Observer the tax introduction would be 'another nail in the coffin'. 'The exemption is fundamental to keeping craft cider-making going. If we had to pay an extra \u00a32,500 it would probably stop us risking making wooden-barrel cider and perry because it's too fragile. 'It would be very sad if the tax came in. Not just for financial reasons. It would hasten the demise of traditional orchards and would be another nail in the coffin of traditional cider-making and would be a loss to the natural habitat.' The volume of cider produced annually in the UK is in excess of 6 million hectolitres or 130 million UK gallons, according NACM. Some have blamed the industrial-scale cider makers who account for the production of 130 million gallons of cider in the UK every year for the intervention by the EC, according to the paper. The European Commission, said it was 'unanimously agreed' that the UK excise duty scheme contravenes EU legislation. Currently those that produce less than 70 hectolitres do not have to pay an excise duty . Simon Russell, spokesperson for NACM, told the Financial Times: 'We will make the positive case for the effect of the exemption to be protected whether by retaining the existing legislation or by other means.' The Treasury has been given two months to respond to the commission without a 'satisfactory response' \u00a0the Commission may refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union.

The Cambrian Explosion, around 541 million years ago, was a wide variety of animals burst onto the evolutionary scene. Before about 580 million years ago, most organisms were simple, composed of individual cells occasionally organised into colonies. Over the following 70 or 80 million years, the rate of evolution accelerated \u00a0and the diversity of life began to resemble that of today. It ended with the Cambrian-Ordovician extinction event, approximately 488 million years ago. The latest discovery pushes back the date of multicellular animal evolution to 60 million years before the Cambrian explosion started. Sponges, also known as Porifera, are multicellular organisms that have bodies covered with pores and channels that allow water to circulate through them. Scientists have still to confirm when they first appeared on Earth. Estimates range from 700 million years ago to a time known as the Cambrian period, which took place 541 million to 485 million years ago. The latest finding would place the sponge around 60 million years before the Cambrian started. Researchers want to pin down the date because they believe it is key to understanding early animal evolution. The split between sponges and most other animals was a major event in the early history of life on our planet. The sponge, found in the Doushantuo Formation, is just over one millimetre in height and width, according to researchers from the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology. To get a good look, scientists used scanning electron microscopy and X-ray technology. The team has named it Eocyathispongia qiania and say that it is made up of hundreds of thousands of cells. Its structure is formed in three tube-like chambers that are fixed to a common base, with cell structures that resemble those in modern sponges. Scientists also found surface cells that indicate pores, like modern sponges, which control water flowing into the organism. The sponge, found in the Doushantuo Formation in southern China (left), suggests the date of multicellular animal evolution was 60 million years before the Cambrian explosion started.\u00a0Scientists found surface cells that indicate pores, like modern sponges (right), which control water flowing into the organism . There was an area inside one of the tubes with pits surrounded by raised collars - a possible precursor to choanocyte cells which modern sponges use to move water through their bodies. As well as being one of the oldest of the really old sponge fossils found, the find also represents one of the most pristine. The researchers say they have more material from the site where the sponge was found, and will be sifting through it looking for more tiny sponges and perhaps other organisms. Lead author Maoyan Zhu told IBTimes UK that the find suggests that animals on Earth began diversifying 600 million years ago. 'Discovery of additional specimens would confirm that the fossil represents a Precambrian sponge,' he said. 'But features of the fossil are consistent with sponge anatomy\u2026 fossils of similarly advanced eumetazoans [all major animal groups except sponges] may yet lie in the fossil record.' The researchers say they have more material from the site where the sponge was found, and will be sifting through it looking for more tiny sponges and perhaps other organisms .", "reference": "The sponge was found in the Doushantuo Formation in southern China .\nIt suggests multi-cellular evolution took place before\u00a0Cambrian explosion .\nThe Cambrian explosion is believed to have begun 541 million years ago .\nThe explosion refers to a time when complex creatures rapidly\u00a0appeared ."}, "443": {"id": "cd5bef986372f32075b6b71c0b6f573362e376c1", "article": "Standing in the middle of a pitch with a crowd of around 40,000 questioning your fitness and ability to get decisions right is a real test of mental strength. Having a group of athletic, testosterone-fuelled players surrounding you, trying to intimidate and bully you into making a decision which favours them, is almost too much to bear. And I am incredulous that Gary Neville and John Terry seem to think this harassment of referees is now somehow acceptable. John Terry (centre) led the protests as he screamed at the referee following Ibrahimovic's first-half challenge . In November 2006 I reported Chelsea and their players for attempting to intimidate me during a game at Tottenham. I asked the FA to study a specific incident, which was clear on video, when I felt intimidated and pressurised to give a decision.

Louis van Gaal is coming under increasing scrutiny but the lack of goals being scored by his forwards is a worry - with talk of United deciding not to sign Radamel Falcao on a permanent transfer due to his less than impressive performances. Club legend Dwight Yorke formed a formidable partnership with Andy Cole during their years at the Red Devils and he feels that their current crop of creative players need to start providing the forwards with the same quality and style he had at Old Trafford. Dwight Yorke scored an impressive 48 goals in 96 games for Manchester United and Sir Alex Ferguson . Speaking to the\u00a0Sunday Mirror he said: 'I'm sure it's only a matter of time before things click, but as strikers you also need the players behind you to make it happen. For me and (Andrew) Coley, we were blessed, as we had the likes of Beckham, Giggs and Scholes providing the ammunition. It was dead easy for us, we just had to put the ball in the net. They were magical times and we had many magical moments. 'Hopefully the same thing can happen again for this United side.' Andy Cole and Yorke were formidable but had David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs providing them . Wayne Rooney is the clubs current top-scorer with 11 goals in all competitions, with the England captain also being asked to drop into midfield in the past couple of months. With Robin van Persie recently suffering an injury, Yorke feels that Rooney and Radamel Falcao could be the pairing to set Old Trafford alight again. He said: 'United have world class strikers in the likes of Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao, but they don't seem to have found the ideal combination. Wayne Rooney is the clubs top scorer with 11 goals in all competitions despite playing recently in midfield . Radamel Falcao has failed to impress at United and was hauled off against Preston in the FA Cup . 'Rooney and Van Persie as a pairing hasn't really clicked, so maybe a Rooney-Falcao combo might provide the answer for United long-term.'

De Kock's 26 against United Arab Emirates in their last World Cup pool game was his highest score in his last seven one-day internationals, a run that followed his century against Australia in November. The difficult patch, including five single-figure scores, is a far cry from De Kock's early career form, which once saw him score three straight centuries against India in December 2013. Quinton de Kock looks to the skies in dejection after being caught out against the UAE for 26 runs . The out-of-form opener leaves the field after being dismissed against Pakistan for a duck . While AB De Villiers and Hashim Amla currently lead the run charts for the Proteas, ahead of their quarter-final against Sri Lanka on Wednesday at Sydney, Domingo is confident De Kock is closer than ever to a match-winning innings. When asked if De Kock was facing a mental barrier, Domingo told a press conference: 'I am not a sports psychologist but I don't know how a player can be perceived to be mentally shot. It's a little bit nasty. 'It's going to be a tough selection (meeting). On the one hand we know Quinton has got the ability to win games. But it's often difficult to have all six batters in form at the same time. 'We just sort of have this gut feeling that Quinton has got a big score around the corner. He's done well against Sri Lanka. I'm sure he'll have a good feeling playing against Sri Lanka.' One player De Kock can look up to outside of his own dressing room is Kumar Sangakkara, with the Sri Lankan currently leading the World Cup run-scoring charts at 496 - he has four successive centuries to boot and is fighting for the number one ranking with De Villiers. De Kock is set to continue at the top of the South Africa batting order for the quarter-final against Sri Lanka . South Africa coach Russell Domingo believes De Kock is due a big score . For Domingo, though, the law of averages again is a handy way to look at things, as he added: 'He's in the form of his life. You've got to think his low score is just round the corner I suppose. 'But we have worked on some plans that we feel we need to execute well against him.' And while South Africa hope they have 'learned from the lessons' of past sides, Sri Lanka are getting political in their approach to the knockout stage. No less than Sri Lanka's president and prime minister have offered their vocal support, with the latter unsurprisingly keen to claim his successful election campaign from January as the benchmark for aiming high. In quotes paraphrased in a statement on Sri Lanka cricket's website, prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stressed on the need to study South Africa's weaknesses, adding: 'That's what some of us did last December.'", "reference": "South Africa play Sri Lanka in the World Cup quarter-final on Wednesday .\nQuinton de Kock's 26 against UAE was his highest score in seven ODIs .\nCoach Russell Domingo is keeping faith with his out-of-form opener .\nDomingo is sure De Kock is set for a match-winning innings ."}, "446": {"id": "6daf8a42e63f3e8f627b83f3673ccf2e44fde44d", "article": "If Roy of the Rovers made a comeback as a defender, he would be an all-action Brazilian with electric hair, have 6.5million Instagram followers and call them all \u2018geezers\u2019. The new comic book star would score a magnificent booming header against his former team, celebrate with a screaming knee slide, scrap with the evil baddie of the opposition (Diego Costa) and finish the struggle victorious, shaking hands with the ground staff before exiting for his next adventure. The problem for the script writers, if they were to copy the life and times of David Luiz, is that they would have no idea what David Luiz was going to do next, so what chance do the opposition \u2013 or his team-mates \u2013 have? David Luiz jumps for joy after his bullet header forced the game in to extra-time on Wednesday night . Luiz celebrates victory with team-mates Thiago Motta (right) and Maxwell at the final whistle . When you expect Luiz to be heading it clear, he\u2019s chasing the glory, when you expect him to be chasing the glory, he appears from nowhere to head it clear. Losing 7-0 in a World Cup semi-final, he still thinks he can get a goal back. Maybe a second. Who knows? A hat-trick. On that occasion it finished 7-1 and the one-man reconnaissance mission broke down, leaving gaps behind him for the German team to exploit. Would it change his approach? Of course not. Even on Wednesday night, with Paris Saint-Germain drawing 2-2 at Chelsea with minutes remaining and set to go through with 10 men on away goals, he turned up on the right wing to collect the ball and retain possession. Luiz looks on in disgust as Germany celebrate one of their seven goals in last summer's World Cup semi-final . He\u2019s a defender who sees defending as a part-time job. So concerned was Laurent Blanc, a World Cup-winning centre back with 97 caps, which suggests he knows a bit about defending, that he played Luiz in midfield in the first leg, with two centre backs behind him for cover. He was back in the back four for the second leg and, when it works, it works spectacularly. Who else could have got them through when their talisman, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, had been sent off? Luiz could have been sent off too for his feuding with Costa, but instead he rose majestically in the land of the giants that is Chelsea\u2019s penalty area to send a thunderball of a header into the roof of the net. The defender stumble backwards after one of many confrontations with Diego Costa on Wednesday night . To get ahead of John Terry, Gary Cahill or his marker Branislav Ivanovic takes great skill, movement and courage but to meet the ball with such ferocity\u2026 maybe there\u2019s more to Luiz than his Sideshow Bob nickname and carefree style. Then came the celebration. Not just a former player quietly enjoying the moment against the club that sold him, but a full-pelt emotional surge of joy. He said he wouldn\u2019t celebrate on his first return to Stamford Bridge, but who can blame him for loving the moment? It was a goal worth celebrating. Chelsea sold him because they thought the deal was too good to refuse and, presumably, because they thought Terry and Cahill could do the job better. Few can argue with that \u2013 Terry, especially, has been magnificent as a defender this season but can he hit a dipping, swerving free kick, Cristiano Ronaldo style, from more than 30 yards, as Luiz did on Wednesday night? Jose Mourinho has a word with Luiz on the touchline as PSG manager Laurent Blanc watches on . Luiz rises to beat Branislav Ivanovic to Thiago Motta's corner and head home PSG's equaliser . Not everyone is a Luiz fan \u2013 Jamie Redknapp wrote on this website that \u2018whoever struck the deal to sell Luiz for \u00a350m deserves a knighthood\u2019. And, as Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel reported, Jose Mourinho thought Luiz was too much of an optimist as a defender. Samuel wrote: \u2018Mourinho wanted miseries at the back. He wanted players who feared the roof was about to fall in, the move was going to break down, a counter attack was only a stray pass away. Luiz wasn\u2019t like that. He roamed, he left gaps, he charged upfield and if that break went wrong he thought it wouldn\u2019t matter. He didn\u2019t check for danger, he was rarely alarmed. Luiz was too much of an optimist to defend properly.\u2019 The optimist will make mistakes. He will raid upfield when he should be focussing on shutting the door, but he had a lot of fun at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night and he\u2019s still in the Champions League.

No blame attached for the goal and a very good save from Eder on 51 minutes. One of the positives for England. Nathaniel Clyne 5 (Walker 45) Always willing to offer an outlet in attack but the system left him exposed in defensive areas and switched at half time. Chris Smalling 5 .

England and Manchester United defender Phil Jones (left) falls following a challenge from\u00a0Roberto Soriano . Phil Jagielka 5 . Heavy touch in bring the ball out and, along with Smalling, failed to command the penalty area for Italy's goal. Look ill at ease. Kieran Gibbs 6 (Bertrand 88) Like Clyne, often looked lost without support from a wide midfielder. Had chance to equalise on 54 minutes but drove into side netting. Improved in second half. Phil Jones 4.5 (Carrick 44) When Carrick came on to relieve him from the holding midfield role as it was though he'd escaped purgatory.

Didn't ever really settle into the system. Fabian Delph 5.5 (Townsend 70) Much the same. Harried and was strong in tackles but too often was a man chasing around in search of a game plan. Wayne Rooney 7 . The flashes of class England showed invariably came from him; shot off the bar on 22 minutes, a glorious cross field ball for Walcott on 27 minutes. Tested Buffon in second half \u2013 perhaps should have scored on 72 minutes. Harry Kane 6 . Lost in a vortex of team-mates' inability to pass the ball.

Able and capable in possession \u2013 well on top of England's midfield for much of the game.

Ireland's lynchpin fly-half has 'hit all his markers so far' in battling hamstring trouble, but is still fighting to recover to face Wales on Saturday, according to team manager Mick Kearney. Number eight Jamie Heaslip was due to take contact training on Monday for the first time since fracturing three vertebrae in his back against France on February 14. Ireland's Johnny Sexton is winning his battle to be fit to face Wales in the RBS 6 Nations on Saturday . The Leinster stalwart is now expected to be fit to face Wales, where victory would leave Ireland almost nailed-on for the Grand Slam. 'Johnny Sexton continues to improve following a mild hamstring strain,' said Kearney. 'As a precaution he will have modified training during the early part of the week with an expectation that he will train fully towards the end of the week. 'We are very happy where he is at, at the moment. He has hit all his markers so far. 'Johnny will have modified training in the early part of the week and if he comes through training through the latter part of the week, he will be available for selection. Sexton has come through all the tests asked of him so far but there is still a chance he could miss the game . 'Jamie Heaslip is expected to train fully this week and barring any setback will be available for selection.

Jamie will train fully today.' Team manager Kearney admitted British and Irish Lions Sexton and Heaslip are both 'extremely eager' to face Wales this weekend. Ireland are gunning to retain the Six Nations title for the first time since 1949, and also claim a second Grand Slam in six years. Sexton limped out of the latter stages of Ireland's 19-9 victory over England in Dublin on March 1 and has been battling to recover ever since. The 29-year-old has a history of hamstring problems, but Kearney does not expect that to colour his recovery. Jamie Heaslip is expected to train fully this week and barring any setback will be available for selection . 'From what I remember the last time he had a problem was between the Australia game and New Zealand game, in the November series just over 12 months ago,' said Kearney. 'He actually recovered pretty quickly then. 'He came off at half-time against Australia and was fit to play and played the whole game, or most of the game against New Zealand without any issue. 'That certainly wouldn't be a worry at the moment. 'Jamie (Heaslip) hasn't taken any contact yet. He will train fully today and provided there is no reaction he should be available for selection. 'They are extremely eager, absolutely: very eager to play.' Fit-again Ulster lock Dan Tuohy has been drafted back into Ireland's wider 36-man training squad . Fit-again Ulster lock Dan Tuohy was drafted back into Ireland's wider 36-man training squad for the final two weeks of Six Nations action. Ireland must win in Wales and Scotland to secure the Grand Slam and retain their Six Nations title - but, barring injury, will do so without veteran centre Gordon D'Arcy. The 35-year-old Leinster centre has been omitted from Schmidt's training squad, with Ulster's Darren Cave and Munster's Keith Earls providing midfield cover. Team manager Kearney refused to accept D'Arcy's absence could spark the end of his glittering 81-cap Test career however. His long-term centre sparring partner Brian O'Driscoll retired last summer, but D'Arcy himself has always been determined to push on to this year's World Cup. 'That is a selection issue, yes,' said Kearney of D'Arcy's absence. 'Gordon has been an unbelievable servant for Irish rugby. 'He's back fit, back playing for Leinster, so certainly I wouldn't rule him out for future consideration.' Both teams must give consent for Saturday's Millennium Stadium match to be played under a closed roof. Team manager Kearney said Ireland will delay their decision until later in the week, and base it around the chances of rain. 'We are waiting to see what the weather forecast turns out like,' said Kearney. 'We don't have to make a decision on that until 7pm on Thursday. 'We will wait until then before we make a final decision. 'I think overall, our preference would be for a dry day and decent weather, rather than wet and miserable weather.

Harlow Council and Essex County Council were granted the interim injunction after Harlow, Essex, was besieged by travellers illegally camping on cycle paths, highway verges and car parks.

Above, one travellers' camp in the town last year . In total, the areas covered by the ban account for a third of the land in Harlow, according to a spokesman for the council. Gipsies have been moved from illegal encampments in the town - which is just 25 miles from Dale Farm, formerly the site Europe's largest traveller camp - on 109 occasions since October 2013. The temporary injunction will mean anyone illegally camping in Harlow could be fined or imprisoned for contempt of court. It will remain in place until a full hearing later this year. The order was served to travellers who were part of an unauthorised camp at Horsecroft Place this morning. The group has since moved on from the site, a spokesman at Harlow Council said. Injunction papers will also be  displayed on the 454 parcels of land over the coming days. The ban applies to 35 named travellers, all of whom have now left the town, and will also protect land from encampments by 'persons unknown'.

Harlow Council leader, Jon Clempner, said: 'The town has had enough and we needed to resolve this situation with a long term solution to protect land now and in the future. 'An injunction, which covers a piece of land here and there was never going to work, so we had to look at a something which has never been done before and is town-wide.

In many cases that may be more than the total price of the holiday booked. London City Airport's proximity in the heart of London means the site urges travellers to use public transport if possible - it's worth considering when parking can be as much as \u00a3315 per week . How the airports around the world ranked where it came to car parking . Even when booked in advance, a week's parking at London City is twice the price of New York's JFK Airport - and nearly three times the cost of parking at Tokyo International Airport, research by Justpark.com has discovered. Parking rip-offs are not only suffered by holidaymakers leaving their cars at the airport while travelling abroad. Those collecting friends and family from airports are also charged extortionate amounts for short-term parking, paying \u00a315 for 1-2 hours at London City and \u00a312 at Heathrow.

He added: 'When people are paying more for their airport parking than their flights, something needs to change. We want to redress this balance and make airport parking more affordable.' The high cost of airport parking in the UK has led holiday-makers to seek alternative, more affordable options. Over 600,000 drivers use the app and website JustPark to find and book parking spaces on local residential driveways, rather than paying airport prices. More than 200 Heathrow homeowners are renting out their driveways for as little as \u00a321.50 per week through JustPark, giving holidaymakers an 85 per cent saving on official airport parking and putting money back into local people's pockets.

When doctors told 18-year-old Hannah Tate from Maryville, Tennessee, she was well enough to attend her prom, she took to Instagram to get in touch with hairstylist Tokyo Stylez, who has worked with Rihanna, Naomi Campbell, and Gabrielle Union, in the hopes that he would send her one of his custom-made wigs. But Tokyo took his generosity one step further and secretly began working with Hannah's mother LaVetta Spann in order to personally deliver and style the wig before the Alcoa High School dance. Scroll down for video . Unforgettable moment: Hannah Tate, who is battling a rare kidney cancer, posed for a pre-prom photo after a celebrity hairstylist gave her a complete makeover before the high school dance last Saturday . So grateful: The next day, the 18-year-old, who goes by the Twitter name Molly Copeland, took to Twitter to thank everyone who had helped her get to her senior prom . Hannah was diagnosed with cancer last November and lost her hair after chemotherapy and radiation treatments. She spent most of her senior year of high school undergoing treatment at St. Jude Regional Children\u2019s Hospital in Memphis and missed out on basketball games, track meets, and dance competitions. But she was thrilled that she was able to go to her senior prom with all of her friends.

I didn\u2019t want her to because I didn\u2019t want to cry,' Tokyo told the outlet. He added: 'It\u2019s like a once in a lifetime thing. You only go to your senior prom once, so to be a part of it is something that she\u2019ll always remember.' Hannah's new wig was styled in long waves that tumbled over her shoulders, and she donned a floor-length gown featuring a crystal-covered black halter bodice and a flowing white skirt.

It may also purchase more brainpower. A study found the children from wealthy families have bigger brains than their poorer counterparts. Los Angeles researchers say being wealthy boosts brainpower. Their study found that money was important to a young mind. Parental income was found to be more important than their education. Shown is a picture of Angelina Jolie, Maddox Chivan Jolie-Pitt and Brad Pitt . Brain regions key to academic success were particularly large, the journal Nature Neuroscience reports. Interestingly, the study also revealed that money matters more than parental background when it comes to nourishing the young mind. In one of the first studies of its kind, the US researchers put more than 1,000 healthy children and teenagers through brain scanners and quizzed their parents on their background and income. Richer people live further away from their parents than those on modest wages, a study in December 2014 claimed. The report found workers earning less than \u00a325,000 ($37,000) live within 31 miles (50km) of their family, but this distance grows the wealthier people become. Britons who earn \u00a335,000 to \u00a345,000 ($52,000 to $67,000) live 42 miles (68km) away while those earning more than \u00a355,000 ($81,000) live 47 miles (76km) away. Annuities firm Partnership said this was because high-earning professionals were more likely to have moved away from where they grew up to secure a lucrative career. The study also found people in their 50s live closest to their ageing parents, but later move farther away to be near their own children and grandchildren. While people in their 40s lived 37 miles (60km) away, on average, this reduced to 33 miles (53km) as people reached their early 50s. The youngsters, who were between three and 20 years old, also did tests of memory and something called executive function. This term covers the mental skills that are used to weigh up options, prioritise, multi-task and plan ahead. Children with poor executive function may struggle to memorise information and be more likely to get into fights. Analysis showed important brain areas to be bigger in children whose parents had been to university than those whose education had finished when they left school. However, parental income was even more important. Brain areas key to language and executive function were bigger in children from wealthier families. These youngsters also did better in the mental tests. Researcher Dr Elizabeth Sowell, of the Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, said: \u2018Our data suggest that wider access to resources likely afforded by the more affluent may lead to differences in a child\u2019s brain structure. \u2018Access to higher-quality childcare, more cognitively stimulating materials in the home and opportunities for learning outside the home likely account for some of these effects.\u2019 Analysis showed important brain areas to be bigger in children whose parents had been to university than those whose education had finished when they left school. However, parental income was even more important, perhaps because the children had better living conditions (stock image shown) She said that growing up in a household that is free of the stress of struggling to make ends meet is also likely to foster brain development. The link between income and brain structure were particularly noticeable among the most deprived children, with small differences in salary having a relatively big effect on the brain. It is thought this is because a slight increase in income makes a bigger difference to living conditions to someone on a low wage than to someone who is already well provided for. Researcher Dr Kimberley Noble, of Columbia University in New York, said that despite the clear impact of socio-economic status on the young mind, it would be wrong to think that the changes are fixed. She said: \u2018This is the critical point. The brain is the product of both genetics and experience and experience is particularly powerful in moulding brain development in childhood. \u2018This suggests that interventions to improve socioeconomic circumstance, family life and/or educational opportunity can make a vast difference.\u2019", "reference": "Los Angeles researchers say being wealthy boosts brainpower .\nTheir study found that money was important to a young mind .\nParental income was found to be more important than their education .\nThis is thought to be due to a difference in living conditions ."}, "464": {"id": "d17dec19eae3488e6a823755400888fdaa630e16", "article": "A father-of-three who claims he has spent 53 years living in Britain is facing deportation back to the U.S after being caught up in an immigration crackdown. Robert Carl Jordan was born in the U.S to an American soldier and a so-called 'GI Bride' - one of thousands of British women who crossed the Atlantic to marry soldiers during the Second World War. But when his parents split up when he was aged three, Mr Jordan moved back to Manchester with his mother. Robert Carl Jordan who claims he has spent 53 years living in Britain - including paying taxes and starting a family - is facing deportation back to the U.S after being caught up in an immigration crackdown . The 56-year-old, who lives close to his elderly mother in Haughton Green, Tameside, says he then set up a life for himself in the UK, which involved attending school, paying taxes and working for four decades. He also married a British woman with whom he had three children. But, since arriving in 1963, neither he nor his mother has ever sought to obtain British citizenship for Mr Jordan, believing he was entitled to stay in the country on account of his mother's nationality. In fact, those who are born to British parents outside of the UK are not automatically given a permanent right to remain - and he should have applied for citizenship. Now, the Government has decided Mr Jordan should be deported from the UK because he does not have the correct paperwork to allow him to stay. Mr Jordan, who has until April 6 to appeal the decision, said: 'I thought it would be all right because I've been married here, I've got three kids and all my family are here. I didn't think it was going to get this serious.' The former railway guard and Royal Mail postman claims he did not know anything about applying for citizenship until immigration officers turned up at the pub where he worked just before Christmas. The father-of-three, pictured with his son Matthew and daughter Chloe, has until April 6 to appeal Government's decision to send him back to the U.S because he does not have the right paperwork . After receiving an anonymous tip-off about Mr Jordan's situation, officials arrested him for working illegally in the UK. He was then released on the condition that he reports regularly to an immigration centre in Salford. Many Europeans who have been in similar situations to Mr Jordan have managed to stay in the UK due to their right to private and family life, under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In 2011, Amir Beheshti, from Iran - who had been trying to get refugee status for seven years but had the claim repeatedly turned down - was allowed to stay in the UK because he said he had a private life that involves going for work-outs with his friends. The 40-year-old's lawyers argued his human rights would be violated if he was deported because he had become 'well integrated' in the Glasgow community. The controversial legal ruling by Scotland\u2019s Court of Session meant the threat of deportation has been removed and Beheshti is free to remain in Scotland indefinitely. Beheshti\u2019s claim, it said, was \u2018based on Article 8 ECHR and, in particular, on the fact that he had, so he claimed, established a private life in the UK. Earlier this month,\u00a0Branko Loncar, 55 - who won asylum by claiming he fled Croatia due to anti-Serb discrimination - was allowed to stay in the UK, despite being convicted of killing his wife. Since being convicted of the crime in his absence during a retrial in 2000, Croatia had asked for Loncar's extradition from UK - but his lawyers fought move . They argued that he had right to family life with his new Serbian partner in the UK - despite the pair living hundreds of miles away from one another. In the meantime, Loncar continued claiming benefits and was convicted of common assault in the UK. But the High Court still ruled that it would be 'oppressive' to send Loncar back after so long. But Mr Johnson, who is a father to Nicky, 30, Matthew, 20, and Chloe, 15, has now been told to leave the country. The Home Office says Mr Johnson was told he needed to apply for residency in 2007 after being granted a visitor's visa following a two-month holiday away from the UK. But officials said he has failed to provide evidence of long term residency in the country - evidence which would usually come in the form of medical history, tax contributions and evidence of education. Mr Jordan, who has now split from his wife, says he cannot bear the thought of being forced to leave and having to say goodbye to his children. He said: 'I have lived here all my life. I went to school here, I've worked here for 40 years. 'But now I've been told I've been working illegally all that time, even though I've got a National Insurance number and paid my taxes. 'I've not been sleeping or eating. Every time I see my daughter she cries and that sets me off.' Many Europeans who have been in similar situations to Mr Jordan have managed to stay in the UK due to their right to private and family life, under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Thousands have now signed an online petition requesting he be allowed to say. It reads: 'Carl has a close relationship with his children, who are, in the least to say, devastated by this turn of events, especially his daughter, the youngest child. Carl's elderly Mother is also reliant upon him and would therefore be left without the help and care she currently gets from her Son.' Denton MP Andrew Gwynne is also backing his campaign and has asked the government to grant Mr Jordan discretionary leave while he applies for dual nationality. Mr Gwynne said: 'My office has asked the immigration minister to grant discretionary leave for Mr Jordan to remain... while he applies for dual nationality, which he has the right to do because his mother is British. 'I am fully supportive of Mr Jordan. I do feel that he should be given the right to stay.' A Home Office spokesman said: 'People born overseas to a British parent do not gain an automatic right to long term residency in the UK, and the onus is on the individual to ensure their immigration status is free of time restrictions. 'Mr Jordan was told in 2007 of the need to formalise his stay in the UK by providing evidence to support his claim of long term residency. He was also advised in writing on three occasions what level of evidence is required but he has still failed to provide it.'", "reference": "Carl Jordan, 56, was born in U.S. to American soldier and British mother .\nHe moved back to Manchester with his mother when he was aged three .\nFormer postman did not apply for dual citizenship but set up life in the UK .\nHe had three children, was educated here and also\u00a0paid taxes for 40 years .\nBut Home Office says he does not have indefinite leave to remain in UK .\nHe has until April 6 to appeal\u00a0Government\u00a0decision to send him back to U.S ."}, "465": {"id": "a97419e3b0d23e27b85ebbb85ed3a8a05217158c", "article": "Around 200 skeletons have been unearthed under a Paris supermarket after workmen extending the shop's basement discovered a huge pile of bones. The bodies, which were found neatly stacked five deep in eight underground chambers, are thought to be victims of an epidemic that struck France at least five centuries ago. Archaeologists from the National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP) were called in to take a look and have spent  days tirelessly uncovering the bones. Around 200 skeletons have been unearthed under a small Paris supermarket after workmen extending the shop's basement discovered a huge pile of bones . They found seven chambers containing around 20 skeletons each and a further chamber that had another 150. Pascal Roy, store manager of the Monoprix supermarket, said that the shop had been built on the site of the old Trinit\u00e9 hospital, which functioned from as early as the 12th century. He said: 'We figured there'd be a few bones there considering it used to be the site of a cemetery, but we didn't expect to find mass graves.' But other experts have said the bodies might have been placed there when more than six-million corpses were moved to the Paris Catacombs from the city's cemeteries 200 years ago . Archaeologists are slowly and delicately uncovering the skeletons and attaching numbers to them. Above are skeletons 159, 157 and 162 . The bodies are thought to be victims of an epidemic that struck France at least five centuries ago - perhaps the plague or a famine . They were neatly stacked five deep in eight underground chambers. Seven of the chambers contained 20 skeletons and one contained more than 150 . Experts called the site 'extraordinary' and said they were astonished to find so many skeletons in one place. They said: 'The fact that the skeletons were so closely packed together in a mass grave suggests that they were the victims of an epidemic like the plague, which struck France throughout the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries. 'The grave provides an excellent opportunity to learn about how death was managed and how funerary practices were carried out centuries ago.' Isabelle Abadie, an archaeologist, added that it was particularly interesting because the bodies were not thrown into the graves, suggesting that they might have been placed head to toe to save space. Pascal Roy, store manager of the Monoprix supermarket (left), said that the shop had been built on the site of the old Trinit\u00e9 hospital, which functioned from as early as the 12th century.

The archaeologists use particular tools to excavate their site including a small shovel, a variety of brushes and sometimes a garden hoe . Fragments of medieval ceramics were also found among the bones,  along with pottery dating from this century. The archaeologists on site will now carry out carbon and DNA testing on the bones to find out more and will then be able to more accurately date the find.

The discovery comes weeks after 15 skeletons were found in a unique\u00a0Romano-British settlement in Ipplepen, Devon. The remains of two skeletons buried together in Diros Caves, Greece, were also unearthed in 2013 and were analysed to show they were 6,000 years old around two weeks ago.

On Monday, a judge ruled that the Arizona woman is innocent and dismissed all charges against her. This makes Milke only the second woman exonerated from death row in the United States. More importantly, the judge's decision finally clears Milke after years of legal back-and-forth in a case where she steadfastly maintained her innocence. Key to the case's dismissal was prosecutorial misconduct, mainly that of a detective, Armando Saldate, who said Milke confessed to the crime to him -- even though there was no witness or recording. Prosecutors withheld from the jury Saldate's personnel record which showed instances of misconduct in other cases, including lying under oath. The two men with whom Milke was accused of conspiring were tried separately and are still on death row. A day after seeing Santa Claus at a mall on December 1, 1989, young Christopher Milke asked his mother if he could go again. Milke's roomate, James Styers, took the boy; then called Milke saying Christopher had disappeared. Instead, Styers and a friend drove the boy out of town to a secluded ravine where Styers shot Christopher three times in the head, prosecutors said. Styers and the friend were convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Milke was implicated based on alleged testimony from Styer's friend, Roger Scott. The detective, Saldate, said Scott told him that Milke was involved in a plot to kill her son. And during her trial, prosecutors floated a likely motive: A $5,000 life insurance policy she had taken out on the child. But neither Scott nor Styers testified to a plot in court. No other witnesses or direct evidence linked Milke to the crime other than Saldate's testimony. Saldate further said that Milke confessed to her role in the murder plot during interrogation and said it was a \"bad judgment call.\" There was no recording of the interrogation, no one else was in the room or watching from a two-way mirror, and Saldate said he threw away his notes shortly after completing his report. Milke offered a vastly different view of the interrogation and denied that she had confessed to any role. The trial became a he-said/she-said contest between the two. Ultimately, the jury believed the detective and convicted Milke of murder. What prosecutors didn't tell the court was the detective's long history of lying under oath and misconduct. Saldate had been suspended five days for taking \"liberties\" with a female motorist and lying about it to his supervisors. Four confessions or indictments had been tossed out because Saldate had lied under oath. Judges suppressed or vacated four other confessions because Saldate had violated a person's constitutional rights. In 2013, after more than 20 years in jail, an appeals court overturned Milke's conviction. \"The Constitution requires a fair trial,\" Chief Judge Alex Kozinski of the federal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals wrote. \"This never happened in Milke's case.\" \"The state knew of the evidence in the personnel file and had an obligation to produce the documents,\" Kozinski said. \"... There can be no doubt that the state failed in its constitutional obligation.\" Milke was released on bail, and the court said she couldn't be tried again. The state appealed the decision to the Arizona Supreme Court. Last week, the Arizona Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal. And on Monday, all charges against Milke were finally dropped. The ankle bracelet she had been wearing while on bail was removed. And Milke left the court room, sobbing in relief. The case is now closed. Debra Milke is finally a free woman.", "reference": "Debra Milke was convicted of murder in her son's death, given the death penalty .\nThere was no evidence tying her to the crime, but a detective said she confessed .\nThis detective had a \"history of misconduct,\" including lying under oath ."}, "467": {"id": "783512d3f58228d7daaa1a89bcedeeb2ec5bdacf", "article": "Selfie-loving Karen Danczuk has been trying her hardest to put a tough month behind her by doing what she does best - posing for the cameras.

The seven-year-old, trained by Tom Dascombe at Owen\u2019s Manor House Stable in Cheshire and ridden by Richard Kingscote, was always close to the pace in the two-mile Dubai Gold Cup and quickened to beat Star Empire by a decisive three and a half lengths. The victory, the 11th of Brown Panther\u2019s career, secured a first prize of \u00a3384,000, by far the biggest Owen has ever won in his racing venture. Brown Panther had a convincing victory for co-owner Michael Owen at the Dubai Gold Cup . Former England striker Owen watches on at Meydan Racecourse on Saturday in Dubai . Owen, who won the 2014 Irish St Leger with Brown Panther, said: \u2018He is the horse of a lifetime and a superstar in my eyes. That was a tough race \u2013 two miles in this heat and he kept on galloping like he did in the final furlong. \u2018He is a talented horse but has great courage. I am very proud of him.\u2019 The success was also rewarding for Kingscote. He has had a race against time to get fit after suffering a broken collar bone, snapped arm, broke wrist and elbow plus punctured lungs in a fall. There was a second win on the Meydan card for Europe when Sole Power, trained in Ireland by Eddie Lynam and ridden by Richard Hughes, landed the Al Quoz Sprint. While British jockey William Buick landed the $10m World Cup on Saeed Bin Suroor-trained 14-1 shot Prince Bishop, who beat 2014 Kentucky Derby winner California Chrome. The success for an eight-year-old who has never won at group one level in Europe and was running in his fourth World Cup was another surprise result in the race. It again showed the Dubai World Cup may be the richest race on the globe but it is of questionable quality. Another former England striker Peter Crouch was also in Dubai with his wife Abbey Clancy . Owen is pictured being questioned by the media after victory for his horse Brown Panther . Meanwhile, owner Marwan Koukash continued his good run of sporting form when 12-1 shot Gabrial, trained by Richard Fahey and 22nd winner of the year for jockey Tony Hamilton, landed the Betway Lincoln Handicap at Doncaster. It was a second win in four years for Gabrial\u2019s team, having landed the 2012 Lincoln with Brae Hill. Flamboyant Koukash is the owner of Super League team Salford Red Devils, who have risen to sixth in the table after a run of three wins in their last five games. Gabrial, who had been unplaced on the Dubai World Cup card 12 months ago, had also run over middle distances last year as Koukash harboured hopes he may become a Melbourne Cup contender. But he showed slick turn of foot over the mile of the Lincoln to beat Mondialiste a neck. Owen and trainer Tom Dascombe pose with Brown Panther after winning the race . Owen is pictured with his family at the Meydan Racecourse after his victory . Fahey said: They raced in a very tight pack and I wasn't sure he was going to get out in time. \"That's the first time I've ever seen him really pin his ears back and have a real go as he's a bit of a character. Tony said he always felt like he was going to win. \u2018The only reason he was running over further last year was because after Mount Athos got injured. Marwan wanted a Melbourne Cup horse but he didn't stay.\u2019 Trainer Mark Johnston made a perfect start to the Flat season as his first three runners all won.

The plans were revealed to Aviva Rutkin at New Scientist\u00a0by bioengineers from Gingko Bioworks. Rose oil used in perfume is typically harvested from large fields of the flowers planted across Europe. But because these crops can be affected by changes in weather or natural disasters the yield can vary wildly, which has led to perfumers searching for artificial alternatives.

They then modify the genome of yeast to engineer multiple strains of the fungus which each produce different metabolic reactions. The key is to engineer reactions between microbes that create the same compounds found in the scent of a rose. And the firm told Ms Rutkin that this can involve adding genes from a rose or other plant to the yeast's genome to force these reactions. The Boston-based firm is working with flavours and fragrance company Robertet and sends samples of each stage to the French firm for analysis and feedback. The goal is to create a designer fragrance that can be created in bulk and sold to consumers. Gingko is also working on other fragrances as well as cultured flavours and sweeteners. 'We're working on a number of cultured flowers where the scent of the wild flower is difficult or impossible to capture through traditional extraction - such as lily of the valley and hyacinth,' Jason Kelly from Gingko Bioworks told MailOnline. 'These flowers smell wonderful when growing on the plant but the extracted floral oil doesn't capture the scent. 'Perfumers would love to bring these novel scents to life in perfumes and using Ginkgo's technology to design cultured fragrances we hope to grant their wish.' 'The natural next step in the evolution of cultured foods is the advent of cultured ingredients,'\u00a0added\u00a0Gingko's Reshma Shetty. 'Aroma chemicals that previously were made via extraction from plants or synthetic chemistry can now be made via fermentation. 'The mechanics of the process of making cultured ingredients is much the same as those used for thousands of years of cultured food production: the raw material (often sugar) is converted to the desired ingredient using microbes as processing aid.' In 2013 Dutch scientists grew \u2018cultured beef\u2019 in a lab using cells from a living cow.

The world's first test-tube burger made from lab-grown meat (pictured) was  cooked and eaten in London in August 2013. The  patty was developed by Professor Mark Post (pictured) of Maastricht University in the Netherlands and cost \u00a3250,000 to produce . Its creator, . Dutch scientist Mark Post, believes it could revolutionise the food . industry and help save the planet. He believes that artificial meat . products could be sold in supermarkets within a decade. Similar to the cultured fragrances, the burgers are created in a four-step . process. In 2013 Dutch scientists grew \u2018cultured beef\u2019 in a lab using cells from a living cow. The world's first test-tube patty was dubbed Frankenburger, cost \u00a3250,000 and took three months to form. The stem cells are cultivated in a nutrient broth, allowing them to proliferate 30-fold. Next they are combined with an . elastic collagen and attached to Velcro 'anchor points' in a culture . dish. Between the anchor points, the cells self-organise into chunks of . muscle. Electrical stimulation is then used . to make the muscle strips contract and 'bulk up' - the laboratory . equivalent of working out in a gym. Finally thousands of beef strips . are minced up, together with 200 pieces of lab-grown animal fat, and . moulded into a patty. Around 20,000 meat strands are needed to make one 142g burger. Other non-meat ingredients include . salt, egg powder, and breadcrumbs. Red beetroot juice and saffron are . added to provide authentic beef colouring. First, stem cells - which have the power to turn into any . other cell - are stripped from cow muscle, which is taken during a . harmless biopsy. Next, the cells are incubated in a . nutrient \u2018broth\u2019 until they multiply many times over, creating a sticky . tissue. This is then bulked up through the laboratory equivalent of . exercise - it is anchored to Velcro and stretched. Finally, 20,000 strips of the meat are . minced and mixed with salt, breadcrumbs, egg powder and natural red . colourants to form an edible patty. The project was backed by billionaire . Google founder Sergey Brin. Professor Post  spent seven years trying to . turn stem cells into meat, and was first successful with mouse burgers. He then tried to grow pork - producing strips with the rubbery texture . of squid or scallops - before settling on beef. More recently, biohackers in California discovered a way to create cheese protein genes based on sequences in cow DNA, before growing them in baker\u2019s yeast and using them to create a \u2018milk\u2019 substitute. This milk can then be churned using traditional cheese-making methods to become real vegan cheese. Real vegan cheese is the brainchild of biohackers from Counter Culture Labs and BioCurious in California. The technology has already been proven on an individual scale. Last year Mark Post, a professor of tissue engineering at Maastricht University, the Netherlands presented the first lab-grown hamburger . To create the proteins, the researchers studied animal genomes to find natural milk-protein genetic sequences. They optimised the genes for use in yeast and created the resulting yeast milk protein DNA from scratch. This DNA is then put into yeast cells where the cells take over and produce real milk-protein. The genetically modified yeast creates cheese protein as it grows, and raw cheese protein is extracted and separated from the yeast. To make real vegan cheese, the researchers then take the cheese protein and combine it with the three other main cheese ingredients, including, fat, or in this case vegetable butter, vegan sugar in place of lactose, and water. Mixing these creates the vegan milk, which can then be then turned into cheese. Although the genes are inspired by the genetic sequencing of mammals, they are actually made from scratch.

The lack of freedom in their batting and their apparent reluctant to think on their feet while bowling has been the biggest problem for England in a World Cup where they have failed to live up to even the most modest of expectations. And Peter Moores appeared to sum up their whole constipated approach when he said in the aftermath of England\u2019s humiliating defeat by Bangladesh that he would have to \u2018look at the data\u2019 to see what went wrong. Paul Farbrace speaks to the assembled media ahead of England's dead rubber against Afghanistan on Friday . Ian Bell is pictured arriving at Sydney Airport following England's embarrassing defeat against Bangladesh . James Taylor reacts after he loses his wicket en route to a humiliating defeat against Bangladesh . Yet Paul Farbrace, the man who led Sri Lanka to the Asia Cup and the World Twenty20 titles last year before throwing in his lot with England, says that whatever has led to England\u2019s shortcomings here, it is not statistics. \u2018There has been a lot said about stats and team meetings,\u2019 said assistant coach Farbrace. \u2018But when I was with Sri Lanka we had a lot more meetings and looked at stats a lot more than England do. There\u2019s no question about that. \u2018We had a team of six people working with Sri Lanka during the World Twenty20 who provided us with data straight after a game and the next day. Our preparation from fantastic statistics helped us win the final.\u2019 It is Moores who is accused of being driven by the numbers. \u2018It\u2019s tough on him but he accepts the criticism and knows it comes with the territory,\u2019 said Farbrace. \u2018It\u2019s unfair that Peter is the one in the spotlight. We\u2019re all in this together and we\u2019re all responsible for what has happened.\u2019 The theory that England have been stifled by outdated plans has been given credence by the fact that captain Eoin Morgan, who was expected to be a free spirit here, has repeatedly brought up statistics in press conferences. \u2018I can\u2019t answer for them. I can\u2019t say why they said that,\u2019 said Farbrace of Moores and Morgan. \u2018All I know is we\u2019re not spending hours talking about statistics and numbers. We don\u2019t do that. Bangladesh celebrate their shock victory over England in the World Cup earlier this week . Eoin Morgan was expected to be a free spirit at the World Cup but has been bogged down by statistics . \u2018What we do is allow people to look at footage. Everybody has analysis of the opposition downloaded onto their iPads and it\u2019s up to them if they want to look at it or not. There are lots of different ways that people like to learn. \u2018For instance, Ian Bell is someone who is very well planned and methodical. He wants to know how many net bowlers we have, whether there\u2019s a left-arm seamer, how many right-handers there are. And he probably studies the footage in detail. But Moeen Ali will come up to me and say \u2018listen Farb, I\u2019m not interested in what\u2019s on my iPad, I just want to go and bat. And he has had praise for his approach. You have to cater for everybody.\u2019 Farbrace has created an excellent impression around the England team amid the wreckage of this tour and, with his experience of leading Sri Lanka to limited-overs success, it would not be a surprise if he takes greater responsibility for the \u2018new era\u2019 of one-day cricket they have to produce. \u2018There will be a lot of discussion and debate about how we move forward and what the next step is,\u2019 said Farbrace. \u2018We have the Caribbean series where there will be a few changes and Alastair Cook and others will come back. \u2018We made good progress in Test cricket with the Indian series last year and we have to keep building on that. One-day cricket is a completely different story and we have to make sure that by the time we play New Zealand in 50-over cricket this summer we have clear direction. \u2018There\u2019s a fantastic opportunity now for players in county cricket to stick their hands up and say \u2018there are spaces in that England team and I\u2019m going to take my chance\u2019.

Now Lidl, the bargain supermarket chain the middle class love, is trying the luxury-on-the-cheap approach with something rather different: lingerie. The collection, entitled See You In Venice, is part of the Esmara clothing range, and consists of four bra designs in cup sizes 34B, 36B, 38B and 38C. The bras are available in polka-dot, slate grey, black trimmed with pink or nude and black, and cost \u00a33.99. The matching briefs come in small, medium and large, which covers a generous range of sizes between a ten and 20, and a pack of two costs \u00a33.99 \u2014 a fraction of the amount we usually spend on smalls. All the lingerie is made in China from polyester, Lycra and nylon, and is available in Lidl stores while stocks last. If the range proves popular, more sizes will follow, says Sophie Lambert Russell, from the Lidl fashion team. While the undies are certainly cheap, as any woman knows, it can sometimes be a mistake to scrimp on the basics. So, can these supermarket smalls compete with our High Street favourites? To find out if the See You In Venice collection is catwalk chic or bargain bucket, we asked independent lingerie expert Becky John and the Mail\u2019s senior stylist Amy Kester to cast their critical eyes over them, checking for size, fit and comfort. Here\u2019s what they found \u2026 . DARK AND CHIC . BECKY SAYS: \u2018This dark colour is flattering, and it looks classy on nearly every skin tone. There is no seam up the middle of the cup, so it won\u2019t be visible through a tight T-shirt. The briefs are ultra-thin and I do hope they maintain their shape when they are washed. There are seams up the middle of the briefs on the front and back, which might be uncomfortable under tight jeans due to chafing. \u2018However, they are pretty, grown-up looking and great value.\u2019 AMY SAYS: \u2018Wow, this set looks really chic. The underwiring gives good support and the brief-style knickers have good coverage as well as looking glamorous.\u2019 BEST FOR: Date-night. Slate grey padded push-up bra, matching briefs. 5/5 . EVERYDAY ESSENTIAL . BECKY SAYS: \u2018This is probably the most versatile of all the bras and could be worn everyday because of its neutral colour \u2014 it\u2019s just a shame the whole set isn\u2019t completely nude-toned. The black lace trim just looks like a cheap, last-minute add-on. It is only sewn on to the bra at the top and bottom rather than all the way round. I can actually put my finger under it, and I\u2019m worried it might become detached or pucker when washed. The briefs are a good size \u2014 not too grannyish but not too skimpy either.\u2019 AMY SAYS: \u2018I don\u2019t like this one on. The colour reminds me of shapewear and the black lace makes it look cheap. It would have been better in ivory.\u2019 BEST FOR: Everyday wear. Nude with lace trim padded push-up bra, matching briefs. 2.5/5 . GO-GETTING GLAMOUR . BECKY SAYS: \u2018This colour combination reminds me of Agent Provocateur and this set has a lovely diamante detail along with the bows. \u2018The briefs have no centre seams, which will ensure a smooth contour. I like the fact all the Lidl bras have three fastenings on the back. Some cheap sets have only two, or one, which means you can\u2019t adjust them easily. This set looks beautiful and it smacks of luxury.\u2019 AMY SAYS: \u2018Pink on black can look cheap but the satiny fabric makes it look classy. It reminds me of a set Rosie Huntington-Whiteley designed for M&S.\u2019 BEST FOR: A pretty gift. Black padded push-up bra with pink lace trim, matching briefs. 4/5 . POLKA PUSH-UP . BECKY SAYS: \u2018Thin straps look more attractive, but aren\u2019t always strong enough to support a bigger bust and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want such a delicate strap if I was wearing the 38C. \u2018The underwiring doesn\u2019t sit flush to the model\u2019s skin and that\u2019s because the sizes are so limited. \u2018And the half-seam up the front of the bra cup might show under a T-shirt. \u2018But the cut of the cups makes Lauren\u2019s cleavage look really good and there is no unattractive gathering on the knickers. \u2019 AMY SAYS: \u2018I love the bow details, and the lace edging gives it an expensive feel.\u2019 BEST FOR: Teenagers. Cream and black polka-dot padded push-up bra, matching briefs. 3/5 . THE VERDICT OF OUR EXPERTS . BECKY SAYS: \u2018These four styles will give pricier ranges such as La Senza and Boux Avenue a run for their money. But the reason they can retail at such a low price is that the manufacturers need only a few templates as the bra sizes on offer are so limited. I\u2019d be a bit fed up if I\u2019d driven across town to buy a set, only to find that the sizes available are too small for me. \u2018A survey conducted by Debenhams in 2014 found the average bra size of women in England and Ireland is 34C, while in Scotland it\u2019s 34DD. Only Welsh consumers \u2014 whose average size is 34B \u2014 would fit into the Lidl range.\u2019 AMY SAYS: \u2018I\u2019ve inspected the stitching and everything looks finished properly. On the whole, I think they\u2019re well made.

The rescue of Mr Mort was captured on a GoPro camera as well as the moment the avalanche hit at Les Crosets on the Swiss-French border. Scroll down for video . James Mort has told of the terrifying moment he was buried alive in an avalanche while skiing . The Sydney man penned a blog post about his experience, saying he wanted to raise more awareness of the dangers of an avalanche . On his Tumblr, the Australian wrote he had tried to outrun it by skiing over the top of a frozen creek, but was unsuccessful. 'I looked up just in time to watch the avalanche envelope me,' Mr Mort said. 'The last thing I managed to do before I was completely buried was to reach as high as I could above the snow with my left arm and ski pole.' It was this decision that saved Mr Mort's life and helped his friends locate him. Mr Mort was with his two friends, Daniel O'Sullivan (left) and Andrew Sebesfi (right), at the time . Mr Mort's friends started to dig him out from under the metres of snow after the avalanche . He wrote on his blog he found the whole experience terrifying, saying he thought he was going to die . In video of the incident, Mr Sebesfi, Mr O'Sullivan and a third friend, Swiss man L\u00e9onard Ottensmeyer, were unaware of his whereabouts until they find a ski pole sticking out of the snow, which Mr Mort starts waving while buried underneath. His friends call out to him and tell him they were going to get him out. One of them starts to dig through the snow with a portable shovel they have attached to their backpack. His friends found him when he was able to wave his ski pole from underneath the snow to alert them to his location . The avalanche that buried him happened on January 30 while he was skiing with three other people, including two Australians . But Mr Mort shares what he was thinking before he was saved. 'As the snow piled higher and higher, it became darker and darker until I was surrounded by an eerie black silence, broken only by the sound of my slow breathing and racing heartbeat,' he wrote.

VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Nigel Pearson's outburst . Nigel Pearson fixes a reporter with a stare during a tetchy exchange after the draw with Hull . After concluding the press conference, Pearson muttered 'waxing away, my a***' under his breath . He was then further angered by the suggestion his team\u2019s season was \u2018waxing or waning\u2019 with ten games left and seven points separating Leicester from safety. \u2018Waxing or waning, f****** hell. My a***,\u2019 Pearson is heard saying as he finishes his press conference at the King Power Stadium. As he gets up he appears to utter the word: \u2018P****.\u2019 Pearson was irked at his players being accused of intimidating the officials given his stance on such matters. Pearson does not countenance such dark arts. In a December interview he said: 'People who are more cynical-minded might say I\u2019m naive. 'There is a concern at the Premier League about the number of times that is happening. I hope my players don\u2019t start doing it. 'There\u2019s a difference between being streetwise and using intimidation of officials as a vehicle to win. I\u2019d never cheat to win.' He is fiercely protective of his squad and, in any case, replays showed only a couple put their arms up in appeal with the same number of Hull players arguing the opposite. The Leicester manager then seemed to call the journalist a 'p****' for the line of questioning . Pearson looks frustrated during another game where his Leicester side failed to win . It is a third controversial incident for Pearson this season. In December he was banned from the dugout for one game and fined \u00a310,000 for telling a supporter to \u2018f*** off and die\u2019 after receiving sustained abuse. In February he was involved in a touchline exchange with James McArthur as the pair fell together. Pearson jokingly throtted the Crystal Palace midfielder then held onto his shirt as he attempted to rejoin play. The next day brought Pearson\u2019s phantom sacking, when Leicester owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha is believed to have wanted to bring the axe before his son Aiyawatt counselled against. Bruce\u2019s comments ultimately triggered the exchange on Saturday evening. The Hull manager said: \u2018There is a raging debate about Chelsea in midweek. I\u2019ve seen everybody surround Alex for a red card for his challenge. \u2018For me it is a perfectly decent challenge I would expect a centre-half to make. The reason we enjoy the Premier League is its honesty and integrity and if we\u2019re going to go down the route of every other league jumping around, whinging, trying to get people yellow cards and red cards. For me it\u2019s not right.\u2019 Pearson was asked if he thought it was a fair criticism. \u2018No,\u2019 he said, before entering into a tetchy exchange with the journalist which ended with him finishing the press conference in angry fashion, and swearing under his breath. Steve Bruce cited Chelsea in terms of the Leicester players behaved to try and get Alex Bruce sent off\u2026 . Did they? Oh very nice. Do you think that\u2019s a fair criticism? No. What\u2019s your take on that situation? I\u2019ve just said no. But what\u2019s your take on a situation where all the players surround a referee? How many times have you seen us play this year? Three times. Well there you are then. You\u2019re not in a position to judge my players on that. I\u2019m not judging anyone. I\u2019m just asking you\u2026 . You\u2019ve asked me and I\u2019ve told you. No was the answer. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a fair assessment. Full stop. Do you consider that Leicester\u2019s season is waxing or waning? I don\u2019t have to use that sort of analogy. We are in the same position. We\u2019ve got ten games left, six games at home, and our home form has to be drastically improved for us to give ourselves the best chance. That\u2019s it.

The sculptures are less than 1mm tall and are produced via a process called nano-painting. They are too small to be seen with the naked eye so must be viewed and photographed under a microscope.

Ollie Floyd was weeding the fairways at Celtic Manor Resort in Newport, South Wales, with his father when their buggy crashed into the freezing water, trapping him inside. Staff on the 'Twenty Ten Course', which hosted the Ryder Cup in 2010, dived in after the vehicle and managed to drag Ollie to the water's edge. Emergency services were called and Mr Floyd, from Ross-on-Wye in Herefordshire, was taken to Newport's Royal Gwent Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. His 46-year-old father, was also in the 'agricultural spraying vehicle' when it rolled into the lake and was taken to hospital to be treated for minor injuries. The pair worked on sports pitches and stadiums across the country - including Celtic Manor Resort and the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff - for Complete Weed Control Limited.

The New Zealand defender put pen to paper on a six-and-a-half-year contract worth \u00a360,000-a-week. And the 26-year-old, who had been linked with moves to Arsenal and Tottenham with his contract expiring in the summer, is pleased to have his future tied down. Winston Reid has agreed a new six-and-a-half-year contract with West Ham . Reid had been linked with a move at the end of the season to either Tottenham Hotspur or Arsenal . He told fanbookz.com: 'Obviously I'm absolutely delighted to have signed a new contract with West Ham. I've enjoyed my time here, and I just needed to make sure that the decision was a right one for me and my family. 'There were a lot of factors that I took into account when I was making my decision, but most importantly I felt that I was valued at the club - we will be improving in future seasons and I really feel at home here. 'With regards the decision that I've had to make, I had to be sure that it was going to be a place that I was going to be for the next few years of my life, so I have to feel at home and I feel welcome here. I enjoy living in London and my family is settled so that was the most important thing I had to think about.' Reid took his time in making a decision but clearly feels his future lies with the club having made 27 appearances across all competitions this season. He added: 'It might have been frustrating for the fans to have it drag out for so long, but whenever I've been asked this question over the past few months it's just been when we've been negotiating. 'You don't sort something out in the course of one day, there's always got to be some sort of give or take when doing these things. 'There was no big drama towards it, and there was a lot of stuff in the press that was misleading with regards to my situation, but the main thing is that now we've got it sorted. 'Both the club and I were keen to do something, and I'm happy to be staying here. Speaking to the chairman it was clear that the club is on the up, we've been getting better this year but we were realistic about the club and where it's at currently - there's a lot that we can still improve on, and that was the main thing.' Reid went off after just eight minutes of West Ham's defeat by Chelsea on Wednesday with an injury . Reid has been at West Ham since 2010 after joining from Danish club FC Midtjylland . West Ham currently sit tenth in the Premier League standings following a vastly-improved campaign in contrast to the travails of Sam Allardyce's side last year. Reid said: 'As long as we all work hard to improve ourselves each day we will get better, and that was the main objective - we want to get the club further up the league and I'm sure that we will in the coming years.' Reid joins James Tomkins and Mark Noble in signing new deals at West Ham. 'For James Tomkins and Mark Noble they've been here all their lives. I've not been here quite as long as them, but come the end of this contract I will have been here for a fair bit. 'It's nice for them to be here and I'm looking forward to the next six years of my life. With the club, I\u2019m looking forward to exciting times ahead and hoping to be a big part of it. 'I came here in a sticky period \u2013 the first year we got relegated, but since then it\u2019s gradually got better. The team has improved, the organisation as a Club has improved as well and we need to do that if we want to go places. \u201cI\u2019ve grown massively over that time too. Coming here five years ago I was only a young kid, but now I\u2019m kind of a Londoner I guess! It\u2019s a second home for me and I\u2019m delighted.' The New Zealand international had his time on the pitch against Chelsea on Wednesday curtailed after eight minutes with a hamstring issue but with 10 days off before the Hammers' next game, he does not expect to miss too much action. 'It's just one of those things with the injury. I had it a little after Crystal Palace and unfortunately it flared up again. It's just part of the game I guess,' Reid said. 'We've got some time to recover now, which is much needed.' Reid also spoke of his excitement in playing at the Olympic Stadium. Reid fights for the ball with Tottenham striker Harry Kane during the recent match at White Hart Lane . 'Moving to the Olympic Stadium was a big factor for me in staying at the club, but it wasn't the deciding part of the deal - it was just one of many positive points. I'm looking forward to playing there, and it's going to be a massive opportunity for us as players and fans of the club to move to such a great facility. 'The deciding factor for me really was where I felt at home and how settled I felt with my family - I am happy here at the club and I wasn't going to stay here if I wasn't happy - it took a bit of time but I'm glad we got there in the end.'

Tony winner and Broadway icon Harvey Fierstein will contribute new material to the original book by William F. Brown and work alongside Zadan, Meron and Leon. Leon won a 2014 Tony Award for directing \"A Raisin in the Sun,\" and earned a nomination for \"Fences.\" Fierstein, as a writer, won Tonys for \"La Cage Aux Folles\" and \"Torch Song Trilogy.\" He's also written books for musical hits including \"Kinky Boots\" and \"Newsies.\" As an actor, he's won Tonys for best actor in a musical (\"Hairspray\") and best actor in a play (\"Torch Song\"). \"We love this yearly tradition and we're more excited than ever to not only bring another Broadway musical to America's living rooms, but also see it land on Broadway as well,\" NBC Entertainment chairman Bob Greenblatt said. \"It's a natural next step for our live musical events, and we're so pleased to be in business with this award-winning creative team and Scott Zeiger, president and managing director of Cirque du Soleil's new theatrical division.

Zadan and Meron will reunite with Leon, with whom they worked on \"Steel Magnolias\" and \"A Raisin in the Sun.\" Universal Television will produce. Casting for both the NBC telecast and Cirque's Broadway production will be announced at a later date. \"The Wiz\" is adapted from L. Frank Baum's \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,\" with a book by Brown and music and lyrics by Charlie Smalls. The production opened on Broadway in 1975 at the Majestic Theatre and won seven Tonys, including best musical. It ran for four years. TV ratings: 'Peter Pan Live!' falls from 'Sound of Music' \"The Wiz\" is a retelling of \"Oz\" in an African-American/multicultural context. It was adapted as a film in 1978 starring Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Lena Horne and Richard Pryor. It centers on Dorothy, a young woman from Kansas, who is swept up in a tornado and relocated to a fantasy world inhabited by munchkins, good and bad witches, and flying monkeys. She eventually takes a path down a yellow brick road to find a wizard who can help her go home. Along the way, she meets a scarecrow, tin man and cowardly lion, who all learn to help one another. NBC chief tackles Bill Cosby, live musicals and comedy woes . For NBC, \"The Wiz\" combines two of TV's biggest trends: live programming and the growing appetite for diversity \u2014 both in terms of casting and programming that best reflect society today. It comes as networks continue to look to live programming like sporting events and awards shows in a bid to break through the clutter in a crowded DVR landscape. In terms of diversity, the success of Fox's hip-hop drama \"Empire\" and other scripted entries including \"Black-ish\" as well as \"Fresh Off the Boat,\" \"Cristela,\" \"Scandal\" and \"How to Get Away With Murder\" have prompted a crush of diverse castings again this pilot season. \"The Wiz\" was one of two productions NBC had been eyeing (alongside \"A Few Good Men\" and \"Music Man\").

And her popularity has taken an especially hard hit since the public became aware that she operated a private email system while serving in President Barack Obama's cabinet. A CNN/ORC International survey taken last weekend, after Clinton held a press conference at which she tried to explain away her secret server, found that Clinton's high approval ratings as an Obama administration official had entirely eroded.

Hillary is currently disliked by as many Americans, 44 percent, as she was in June of 2008 when she officially ended her presidential campaign and endorsed her future employer, President Barack Obama . She is currently disliked by as many Americans, 44 percent, as she was in June of 2008 when she officially ended her presidential campaign and endorsed her future employer. That's a six-point drop from CNN's last poll, taken in November, when 38 percent of respondents said they weren't fond of Clinton. Likewise, a slim majority, 53 percent, said they view Clinton positively, down from 59 percent a few months ago, and 69 percent at her career peak in the State Department in September of 2011. Throughout her time as the country's chief diplomat Clinton generally enjoyed favorability ratings in the '60s. It was after she tendered her resignation in early 2013 that the public's adoration of her began to slide, dipping to 55 percent after she claimed last spring that she and husband bill were 'dead broke' when they moved out of the White House. After a quick bounce back up to 59 percent late last fall, Clinton's likability now teeters above the majority water mark. This as the Democratic politician is expected to formally launch her presidential campaign as early as the first week in April. Clinton's last known paid speech, to the American Camp Association, will take place on Thursday, suggesting an announcement will come within weeks.

The same amount, 51 percent, said Clinton needed to better explain her motives and that they believed she'd done something 'wrong.' The split indicates that while the public haranguing of Clinton over her use of a personal email address to conduct government business has mostly ended the subject could prove as an effective attack line for Clinton's Republican opponent in the general election next year. Still, 52 percent said Clinton's actions don't disqualify her from serving as commander in chief, and 57 percent said they'd be 'proud' to have her in the Oval Office - up from 50 percent the last time CNN's pollsters asked potential voters the same question in March of 2014.", "reference": "The high approval rating Clinton enjoyed as an Obama administration official has entirely eroded .\nShe's currently disliked by as many Americans, 44 percent, as she was in June of 2008 when she ended her presidential bid and endorsed Obama .\nThat's a six-point drop from CNN's last poll, taken in November, when 38 percent of respondents said they weren't fond of Clinton .\nStill, 52 percent said her secret server isn't relavent to her abilitiy to be president; 57 percent said they'd be 'proud' to have her in the Oval Office ."}, "485": {"id": "8730489ba50e2a598a21a633c9907ae1b5075f75", "article": "A group of Avant-garde light designers in Melbourne are about to take an apartment tower and transform it into a beautiful canvas that can tell you more about the weather than looking up at the sky. Thirty-five 'fins' run up and down the 40-story structure that hold 250,000 diffused LED's. Bruce Ramus, creative director of the project, said every half hour the building will communicate the next day's weather forecast, while during the remaining time it will be like a 'light house' communicating the 'feel' of the weather through light. Scroll down for video . The building will communicate the next day's weather forecast as well as reflecting the current 'feel' of the weather . 250,000 LED bulbs are responsible for the flickering lights that can be programmed to look like rain or wind . 'Essentially, if the weather changes, so will the lights,' he told Daily Mail Australia. After spending eight years living in Melbourne Mr Ramus said he noticed Melburnians had a peculiar obsession with the weather and thought it could be possible to 'bring light to a community' in a way that articulates what it actually feels like to be there. During the day it will appear to be a normal building but as the sun goes down and the city is plunged into darkness, you will really see the effects of the lights. 'There's a lot of movement available to this lighting system so if it ever gets windy down in the Docklands, the lights will move directionally with the wind. Every half hour, tomorrows weather forecast will wrap around the building . 'The movement isnt physical but the way we can program the lights means there will be a sense of gentle but apparent movement,' he said. He explained that by experimenting with the lights programming he can take a cool blue and introduce a shadow that can make it appear as if the building is moving, as rain would. The light show will be based off weather data sent through by the Bureau of Meteorology. Don't expect the building to look like the weather forecast app on your phone though as Mr Ramus wants the building to echo more than the temperature. 'It's not necessarily about what the light does but how it makes you feel.' 'We really want to explore how a cool change feels, or the breaking sun feels,' he added. Visionary: Mr Ramus wants architecture to reflect nature and humanity instead of the static concrete jungle we see today . Mr Ramus said light is a language everyone can understand because we don't understand it through our brains, but instead feel and understand it through our bodies. 'When you see a blue light, you might not be able to describe it but you get how it feels. Light is a language we don't have to think about,' he added. Mr Ramus said he wanted to bring a feeling of movement that's engaging so buildings can start to relate to people and reflect humanity. 'You get it out there in nature all the time. There are subtle movements in trees or the ocean. Then when we go to cities, it is just static chunks of concrete and glass. I would prefer they reflect us and the natural elements we are from.'

Hunt Brothers Pizza provides gas stations and convenience stores with ingredients and start up equipment but doesn't charge franchise fees. As a result it now boasts more U.S. sites than either Domino's or Pizza Hut, with\u00a07,300 locations in 28 states. As well as the convenience factor, customers apparently love the taste. Scroll down for video . Loyal fan: Roy Bruce, owner of the Rightway Foodmart poses for a photo in front of a Hunt Brothers Pizza display in Andersonville, Tennessee . 'It beats Pizza Hut and Domino's,' said 23-year-old Brittany Bunch, who buys Hunt Brothers about once a week during breaks from her job at a water damage company. 'It's just got more flavor. It seems like, with the others, you're getting cardboard.' While Hunt Brothers may be unknown in many households, it runs television ads during NASCAR races and cable outdoors shows. For several years, it has sponsored Kevin Harvick, who won the 2014 NASCAR Sprint Cup. On a recent morning at 10:40am, Roy Bruce, who owns Rightway Foodmart in Andersonville, Tennessee, started sliding Hunt Brothers pizzas for the lunch rush into a conveyor-belt oven. Easy-to-make: Each pie starts out frozen, a crust with sauce and a layer of cheese . Build your own: Employees can add fresh pepperoni, extra cheese and other toppings . Tasty treat:\u00a0The result after about five minutes in the 525-degree oven is a bubbling-hot pizza with browned toppings that tastes comparable to the big delivery chains' pizzas . Each pie starts out frozen, a crust with sauce and a layer of cheese.\u00a0Employees can add fresh pepperoni, extra cheese and other toppings. The result after about five minutes in the 525-degree oven is a bubbling-hot pizza with browned toppings that tastes comparable to the big delivery chains' pizzas. In about an hour, Bruce sold that first pizza and another one in two-slice $2.99 'hunks' from a countertop warming display near his cash register. Pizza customers included a UPS delivery driver, a woman on her way to lunch with her daughter and a guy in camouflage who confessed he was just coming from the liquor store. In a typical Hunt Brothers arrangement, Bruce said he paid about $10,000 for his oven, freezer, display case and other equipment and now just pays the Nashville, Tennessee-based company for the pizza ingredients. Hunt Brothers, which is privately owned, fine-tuned this approach starting in the early 1990s when four brothers who'd worked separately in the restaurant industry joined forces to sell pizzas to convenience stores. Hunt Brothers had 750 locations by 1994, said Keith Solsvig, its vice president for marketing. 'Convenience stores in rural areas were the hub,' Solsvig said in a phone interview. 'A lot of people coming and going. And a lot of these smaller towns, they didn't really have a lot of other restaurants or other places to eat.' Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas each have more than 700 locations, Solsvig said. Not all locations are isolated, with Hunt Brothers also found at busy highway interchanges. And it's moved into some urban areas, such as Memphis. The convenience store model is different from a free-standing restaurant, and a Hunt Brothers outlet is likely to bring in far less than the more than $700,000 an average Domino's makes a year, said Darren Tristano, a restaurant industry analyst with Technomic. Speedy delivery: Maria Witkowski hands a Hunt Brothers Pizza from the drive-thru window to a customer at the Rightway Foodmart in Andersonville . Pit stop: In a typical Hunt Brothers arrangement, outlets pay about $10,000 for an oven, freezer, display case and other equipment - they then just pay the Nashville, Tennessee-based company for the pizza ingredients . Tristano noted that 7-Eleven offers pizza in some of its 7,800 U.S. locations and that Little Caesars has also had success in rural areas. While Hunt Brothers declined to discuss company finances, Bruce says he sells about 500 pizzas a month, much of it by the hunk. Combined with drinks and other convenience items, he estimates pizza customers spend more than $10,000 each month in his store. Tristano says the simplicity of the setup has helped the company grow. Bruce agreed. 'In a convenience store, you're doing the register, you're doing gas. You're doing so many different things,' Bruce said. 'It's hard to be able to do pizza from the ground up, making the dough and the whole thing.' Fred England, a food vendor at a furniture factory about 30 miles east of Andersonville, added a Hunt Brothers to his lunch counter about a year ago to keep his customers from looking elsewhere for their pizza fix. 'The problem I had was all these other places were delivering pizza, so I had to come up with something,' he said while stopping at Rightway to chat with Bruce. Angela Moles came in to get three hunks of pepperoni pizza and drinks to take to lunch with her daughter. The 35-year-old Andersonville resident said she buys Hunt Brothers about twice a week. 'I love it,' she said.

Durst, 71, appeared before a judge for a second straight day in his prison-issue, orange jumpsuit to face drug and weapons charges in New Orleans, Louisiana. Authorities found more than a quarter-pound of marijuana and a revolver in millionaire Robert Durst's hotel room when he was arrested over the weekend, a prosecutor said Tuesday. Durst was expected to be held at a Louisiana prison for several more days before being extradited to LA where he has been charged with the first-degree murder of his friend, Susan Berman. Scroll down for videos . All smiles: Robert Durst, who has been charged with first-degree murder in Los Angeles, is transported from Orleans Parish Criminal District Court to the Orleans Parish Prison after his arraignment in New Orleans on Tuesday . Robert Durst is escorted into Orleans Parish Prison. Durst was rebooked on charges of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, and possession of a weapon with a controlled dangerous substance, a small amount of marijuana on Tuesday . And despite the fact the frail 71-year-old is behind bars, his family is so scared of him that they have taken out a restraining order. A New Orleans judge has approved an order of protection, preventing Durst from contacting his\u00a0brother Douglas, head of $1 billion, family business Durst Corp, and other members of his family. Durst, who is worth an estimated $100 million, has been suspected in the disappearance of his first wife and he won an acquittal on a murder charge in Texas. In a documentary about Durst's troubled life, he mumbled about how he 'killed them all,' providing a dramatic kick to the end of the series. But a law enforcement official said his arrest on the murder charge was based on words he wrote. It was revealed on Tuesday that the final episode of HBO's six-part series, The Jinx, drew more than a million viewers on Sunday evening - more than double the audience from the week before. Analysis linking a letter Durst wrote to his friend Susan Berman a year before her killing with one he said 'only the killer could have written' to point police to her body was the key new evidence in the long-dormant investigation into the 2000 killing, the official not authorized to speak publicly told The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing. Durst, 71, was charged Monday in Los Angeles with first-degree murder in the shooting of Berman, the daughter of a prominent Las Vegas mobster. He could face the death penalty under special circumstances that allege he ambushed her and murdered a witness to a crime. He waived extradition in New Orleans, but authorities there charged him late Monday with being a felon in possession of a gun because he had a revolver when he was arrested there Saturday. Assistant District Mark Burton said they found the pot and gun in his hotel room. Attorney Dick DeGuerin said he wants a hearing in Louisiana as soon as possible to contest the arrest. 'The warrant we believe is based on a television show and not on actual fact,' he said. 'We want a hearing as quickly as possible so Mr. Durst can go to California and face trial as quickly as possible.' The judge in New Orleans, Magistrate Harry Cantrell, scheduled another hearing for next Monday. Presented with the two letters in the finale of 'The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst' that aired Sunday on HBO, the eccentric heir blinked, burped oddly, pulled his ear and briefly put his head in his hands before denying he was the killer. Then he stepped away from the tense interview and went to the bathroom, still wearing the live microphone that recorded what he said next. Durst was arrested on Saturday afternoon in New Orleans after police in Los Angeles turned up new evidence in a 15-year-old murder . Durst was back in police custody after an HBO show, The Jinx, appeared to show him confessing to three murders in an unguarded moment. The high-profile eccentric is pictured on Tuesday being driven to jail . 'There it is. You're caught!' Durst whispered before the sound of running water is heard. 'What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.' That moment didn't just make for a captivating ending to the documentary on the eccentric life of an heir to a New York real estate fortune, it could also provide additional evidence for prosecutors. Susan Berman was found shot execution-style outside her home in LA in 2000. Her friend, Robert Durst, was charged with her murder on Monday . The official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the bathroom recording was not presented to prosecutors before charges were filed because detectives were still trying to determine if the recording was tampered with in any way. But legal experts said the audio and other parts of the interview could become key evidence. 'Any statement that the defendant makes that they want to use against him, they can use against him,' said Andrea Roth, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Kerry Lawrence, a defense attorney in Westchester County, New York, said Durst's lawyers will have to try to explain away his comments, perhaps dismissing them as a joke. 'Prosecutors would argue it was a candid moment of self-reflection, and I assume will argue that he knew he was still being recorded, and this was either said in jest or he was being facetious or sarcastic or was being provocative,' Lawrence said. 'I don't think it's quite the smoking gun.' Durst \u2014 still worth millions despite his estrangement from his family, whose New York real estate empire is worth about $4 billion \u2014 has maintained his innocence in three killings in as many states. When Durst approached the filmmakers and agreed to go on camera, against the advice of his lawyers, he had already weathered one murder case, winning an acquittal in a gory Galveston, Texas, dismemberment case by claiming he shot his neighbor in self-defense. He was still suspected in the killing of Berman, whose father was a Las Vegas mobster associated with Bugsy Siegel and Meyer Lansky, and the disappearance of his wife, Kathleen, who was declared dead long after she vanished in New York in 1982. Robert Durst's first wife, Kathleen McCormack (pictured left), \u00a0has been missing since 1982. Her brother, Jim McCormack, said on Tuesday that following the HBO show he hoped Durst would have an 'epiphany of conscience' and tell them what happened to his sister . Berman, 55, was shot once in the back of the head at her home near Beverly Hills shortly before New York investigators planned to question her about Kathleen Durst's disappearance. The documentary showed filmmaker Andrew Jarecki confronting Durst with a copy of an anonymous letter that alerted Beverly Hills police to look for a 'cadaver' at Berman's address. Durst offered that whoever sent it was 'taking a big risk. You're sending a letter to police that only the killer could have written.' Then, in the final episode, Jarecki revealed another envelope, which Durst acknowledged mailing to Berman, that has similar writing in block letters and also misspelled the address as 'Beverley.' 'I wrote this one but I did not write the cadaver one,' Durst said. But when shown an enlargement of both copies, Durst couldn't distinguish them. Robert A.

Mr Greener had to be buried in a double plot of land, which is normally reserved for two people, at his parish church in Hayes, near Bromley, Kent. He was diagnosed at 27 with a condition known as pituitary gigantism where a tumour had grown on his pituitary gland, an organ that controls bodily functions including release of growth hormones. Surgeons removed the tumour when he was already in the record books for being UK's tallest man and he would have continued to grow if they had not. He played basketball internationally for Great Britain in the late 60s and early 70s and played the circus giant in David Lynch's film The Elephant Man.

Savers are being hit with the worst interest rates in history with a third of Isa accounts now paying less than 1 per cent a year. The number of customers trapped in poor-paying Isas has doubled in the last two years as interest rates on them plummet to new lows. One in six accounts offer less than the Bank of England\u2019s base rate at just 0.5 per cent, while some savers are stuck on rates of 0.1 per cent. The proportion of these tax-free accounts returning below 1 per cent has doubled in the last two years, from one in six to one in three. It means that on the current worst Isa rate of 0.1 per cent, someone depositing \u00a315,000 would make a paltry \u00a315 a year in interest. In contrast, a saver on the most competitive rate of 1.5 per cent would make \u00a3225 \u2013 a difference of \u00a3210 a year. With four weeks left to use this year\u2019s \u00a315,000 Isa allowance, many savers will question the value of such accounts. The Building Societies Association said there was not \u2018one single factor\u2019 driving down Isa rates but said the \u2018persistently low base rate\u2019 had contributed to lower returns.

The scheme meant that banks were no longer dependent on savers\u2019 money \u2013 reducing the need to offer competitive rates, it is claimed. Anna Bowes, of independent savings website Savings Champion, said: \u2018After six years of the base rate at 0.5 per cent, this is toughest time on record for savers, and Isa savers have certainly not been immune to the pain. \u2018Isas were once seen as the go-to savings product due to their tax-free status. \u2018But with rates at an all-time low, some savers \u2013 especially those looking to build up a short-term lump sum for perhaps a house deposit or a car \u2013 may need to be more creative. \u2018High-interest savings accounts offer rates of up to 5 per cent before tax, so even a taxpayer could find that this route could earn them more interest.\u2019 But Rachel Springall, of the website Moneyfacts, warned: \u2018Despite the gloomy outlook on savings rates, consumers need to use their tax-free allowance or lose it. \u2018While there might be an abundance of taxable savings accounts out there, it is always worthwhile to track down an Isa equivalent and use the yearly tax-free allowance.\u2019 Savers have lost out on \u00a34.7billion in the last three years due to low interest rates.", "reference": "Figures show savers are being hit with the worst interest rates in history .\nA third of ISA accounts are now paying less than one per cent per year .\nOne in six accounts offer less than Bank of England's 0.5% base rate .\nNumber of tax-free accounts returning less than 1% has doubled ."}, "490": {"id": "c1740ece0fd2a5ce6c69ea2924af34fd440d1e5b", "article": "Rock legends can be a narcissistic bunch.

Bowie now plans to add the masks to an official archive documenting his career after being alerted to them by a team he employs to monitor the art world for pieces inspired by his life . \u2018I was told not to worry as Bowie loves the mask and wants to buy them for his archive. \u2018I spent days making two of them and sent them off to New York and got a message back saying Bowie loved them and thought they were gorgeous. He now wants to buy the whole set. \u2018Because of Bowie\u2019s interest I have now had to take them off the market. I am now making more to send to him and I will have a re-launch of them with an exhibition.\u2019 A touring exhibition of items from Bowie\u2019s archive has been arranged by the Victoria and Albert Museum.

The former Real Madrid striker, who nearly joined Kane at Spurs as part as the deal that took Gareth Bale to Spain, settled the match in the first half in what was a largely unconvincing performance from Vicente del Bosque\u2019s team. Franco Baldini wanted Morata to move to north London but he ended up staying in Madrid before moving to Juventus last summer. His goals have helped them into the last eight of the Champions League and he took that form with him into this Group C qualifier.

Playing instead of the injured Diego Costa he converted a Koke pass on 28 minutes but Spain failed to find the second and still look a long way from the form they showed when they won the Euros three years ago. They also lost Jordi Alba to a groin injury in the second half. La Roja applied all the early pressure but Isco and Morata sent their first shots wide and David Silva missed the target with a diving header 12 yards out from an Isco cross. Ukraine looked dangerous on the coutner attack in the first 20 minutes and Artem Fedetsky sent a wayward volley wide of Iker Casillas\u2019 goal from a corner. From the edge of the area Ruslan Rotan also went close, but again Spain\u2019s goalkeeper was able to watch the ball go wide. Spain attacked with more quality than the visitors and just before the half hour they were in front when Andres Iniesta found Koke and his first time ball sent Morata through. He held off the last defender and when Ukraine keeper Andrei Pyatov went to ground early he lofted the ball over him to score. Spain then enjoyed their best spell. Silva tested Pyatov with another shot and Iniesta began to lead Ukraine a merry dance in midfield. On the day that Xavi showed up in Qatar to sign a three-year contract Spain could easily have been reminded of how much they miss him. Pyatov looks back in despair as Spain take the lead at the\u00a0Estadio Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n . Morata celebrates his first international goal on his third cap for Vicente del Bosque's side . But his Barcelona team-mate was running the midfield until the break. They could have gone in at half time 2-0 up but Sergio Ramos' header from Silva\u2019s free-kick came back off the frame of the goal. Encouraged by Spain\u2019s narrow lead Ukraine had their chances at the start of the second half with Casillas saving Rotan\u2019s free-kick. The keeper then gave Dnipro\u2019s Rotan another chance kicking the ball straight to him but then parried his shot. The Juventus striker is congratulated by his team-mates as Spain made their first-half dominance pay . Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta controls the ball as\u00a0Artem Fedetskiy closes in to make a challenge . That was typical of the sloppiness that had crept into Spain\u2019s play at the start of the second period.\u00a0They needed the second goal \u2013 it might have come when Iniesta fed Morata but his shot was closer to the corner flag than Pyatov\u2019s goal and that was the last thing he did before being replaced by Pedro. At least he had his debut goal. It was still far too easy to reach the edge of Spain\u2019s penalty area and they were saved by Ukraine not being able to make the most of arriving there \u2013 Rotan again shot straight at Casillas after meeting Yevhen Konoplianka\u2019s cross.

But Irish\u2019s comments, part of a wide-ranging interview with Sportsmail about some of the major issues faced by international cricket, carry particular significance: FICA, the Federation of International Cricketers\u2019 Associations of which he is chief executive, represents the players unions in England, Australia, Bangladesh, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, South Africa and West Indies. Tony Irish, the South African boss of the international players\u2019 union, says cricket needs a global view and not a 10-game World Cup that the ICC has planned for 2019 that will exclude the likes of Ireland (above) Fans of Afghanistan, who haven't been disgraced in their first World Cup in Australia and New Zealand . In other words, he is speaking on behalf of the majority of the world\u2019s top cricketers. \u2018FICA takes a global view on the game,\u2019 said Irish. \u2018One of the objectives must be to try to grow the global game. The opportunity for other countries to participate in the World Cup, the pinnacle tournament, is important. \u2018However, we do accept the challenge relating to the length of the event. We think we should look at reformatting the event, perhaps into four pools, or having a pre-qualifier.\u2019 Irish, whose push for FICA to play a greater role in determining the game\u2019s future has not been helped by India\u2019s refusal to form their own players\u2019 union, said the format of future World Cups should not be influenced by the TV-driven desire to guarantee as many group matches as possible for the Indians. Afghan and New Zealand playes come together after their World Cup \u00a0pool A match in Napier . \u2018One can understand that from a commercial point of view, and from the point of view of satisfying the biggest cricket market,\u2019 he said. \u2018But you\u2019ve got to balance against that the fact that a sporting event is a sporting event, and if a team performs poorly in a particular format, then that\u2019s how the results go. The growth of the game is equally important. \u2018The ICC has 105 members \u2013 10 Full Members, and a number of competitive Associate members. The important thing is that the body that administers the global game needs to have a global view.\u2019 Irish, who also heads up the South African players\u2019 association, questioned how Associate nations were supposed to get exposure against the Full Members when the international schedule is already full to bursting. India haven't got a players' union which hinders the international union's powers to push for an inclusive game . He said: \u2018There\u2019s very little framework any more to the Future Tours Programme. It\u2019s not being governed by a set of principles which allows\u2026 cricket to have a greater context. It\u2019s a lot of individual agreements between countries, which are just plugged into a matrix. \u2018It\u2019s a pity the world Test championship has been shelved. The team rankings give some sort of context, but they\u2019re extremely difficult to understand.\u2019 And Irish is concerned that the takeover of the ICC by the Indian, English and Australian boards last year will result in an increasingly unlevel playing field at international level. Though the ICC have promised more funds to all Full Members and the best six Associate teams as a result of their latest broadcasting deal, many are worried that the Big Three will pull away from the Small Seven because they will simply schedule more lucrative series against between themselves. Under the old FTP, teams were obliged to play each other home and away every four years in series of at least two Tests and three one-day internationals. Now, the fixture list is drawn up on the basis of individual agreements between teams. \u2018The fear is that the stronger countries will just play each other more and more, and the weaker countries will have less opportunity to play the stronger countries,\u2019 said Irish. \u2018The rich get richer, and the poor get poorer.\u2019 For a full transcript of the interview, click here .", "reference": "The ICC has cut the 2019 World Cup to be held in England to 10 teams .\nPlayers unions from the top Test playing nations call move short-sighted .\nUnion boss Tony Irish said 'the global game of cricket needs a global view'\nRather than less teams, they say the Cup's format should be revisited .\nA 10-team Cup almost certainly means the likes of Ireland won't be there .\nFICA represents players' unions from most Test-playing nations, not India ."}, "499": {"id": "c27208acb7972fa85b70d8409bd597f328811fef", "article": "If recent pictures are anything to go by, Taylor Swift and Calvin Harris are set to become pop's biggest power couple. After a month of rumours about a possible romance, the twosome were spotted hanging out in Whole Foods in Nashville, Tennessee earlier this week. But if 31-year-old DJ Calvin is to become the new Mr Taylor Swift then he should be aware that he might end up becoming the subject of one of her songs. Scroll down for video . Taylor and Calvin have been rumoured to have been dating for the last month and were spotted together in Nashville,\u00a0Tennessee . Taylor is well known for writing about her love life, with her former boyfriends John Mayer, Harry Styles and Joe Jonas all having inspired tracks on her various albums. Taylor herself even admits that her relationships do inspire her musically. However, she's always careful not to go into specifics. She once said: 'For me, I have a really strict personal policy that I never name names. So anybody saying that a song is about a specific person is purely speculating. And they\u2019re going to do that.' Here we look back over her previous relationships... and the songs they were thought to have inspired. Taylor dated Joe Jonas in 2008 and is thought to have written several songs about him after he dumped her over the phone . Joe Jonas . Taylor and Joe dated in 2008 and it's thought that he inspired her whole Fearless album. 'Forever and Always and 'You're Not Sorry,' were thought to have been about their messy split. Taylor previously revealed that Joe dumped her in a 27 second long phone call, but he countered her claims saying he would have spoken for longer had she not hung up on him. Joe actually wrote an open letter about the situation saying: 'For those who have expressed concern over the \u201927-second\u2019 phone call \u2026 I called to discuss feelings with the other person. 'Those feelings were obviously not well-received. I did not end the conversation. Someone else did. 'Phone calls can only last as long as the person on the other end of the line is willing to talk. A phone call can be pretty short when someone else ends the call. 'The only difference in this conversation was that I shared something the other person did not want to hear. There were later attempts at communication that had no response.' Taylor Swift broke her promise not to name and shame when she wrote her hit song Dear John about her ex John Mayer . John Mayer . Taylor wasn't exactly subtle when she wrote about fellow singer John Mayer who she dated briefly in 2009. She called the song 'Dear John' and she didn't hold back in expressing her feelings for the man who went on to date both Jennifer Aniston and Katy Perry. Some of the lyrics to the song include: 'You paint me a blue sky. And go back and turn it to rain. And I lived in your chess game. But you changed the rules everyday.' Taylor also references the fact that she was too young (at the time she was only 19) to be caught up with an older man. John, now 37, has since said that he didn't feel he deserved to have such a harsh song written about him. Telling Rolling Stone: 'It made me feel terrible, because I didn't deserve it. 'I'm pretty good at taking accountability now and I never did anything to deserve that. It was a really lousy thing for her to do.' Taylor dated Taylor Lautner in 2009 and is thought to have written Back To December to apologise to the actor having dumped him . Taylor Lautner . Taylor and Taylor dated in 2009 and starred in the film Valentine's Day together. And the actor then became the subject of her song, 'Back To December.' In the lyrics Taylor reveals how she dumped a boyfriend - thought to be Mr Lautner - and left the roses that he'd given her to die. Taylor never actually admitted to having dated the actor however, when she was quizzed about their romance on the Ellen Show she remained particularly coy on the subject. Taylor and Jake Gyllenhaal may have looked like the perfect all American couple but in fact they split after just a few months of dating . Jake Gyllenhaal . Jake and Taylor enjoyed a four month romance at the end of 2010 going into 2011 and she wrote 'The Last Time,' about him. Taylor said of the song: '[It] is about an experience I had with someone who was kind of this unreliable guy. 'You never know when he's going to leave, you never know when he's going to come back, but he always does come back.' It is also thought that she wrote 'All Too Well,' about the actor. In the lyrics of the song she references how she left her scarf at his sisters house. When Jake and Taylor went out it was widely reported that the pair had spent time with his sibling Maggie Gyllenhaal who the popstar got on well with. Taylor dated Connor Kennedy in 2012 and speaks favourably about their relationship in Begin Again . Connor Kennedy . Taylor went out with Connor Kennedy - a descendant of the late JFK -\u00a0in 2012  and it's thought she wrote the song Begin Again about him. Taylor said of the song: '[It is] when you've gotten through a really bad relationship and you finally dust yourself off.' The pair only lasted a few months with Taylor admitting just before they split that she perhaps didn't know that much about love. She said in an interview: 'I don't know how to have a normal relationship because I try to act normal, love from a normal place and live a normal life. But there is sort of an abnormal magnifying glass, like telescope lens, on everything that happens between me and anybody else. 'I don't really know that much about love, it turns out.' One of Taylor's most high profile relationships was with Harry Styles who she is thought to have written two songs about . Aubin & Willis Portland Sweater . Sold out!

Given that Harry Styles and Taylor Swift actually only dated for about two and a half months she has got quite a lot of mileage out of their union.

Out Of The Woods references the fact that the pair went on a skiing holiday during their brief romance which started in December 2012. Harry said of Taylor writing about him: 'I think we always say, when we [One Direction] wrote the album, that we write from personal experiences, so it would be hypocritical of us to be like \u201coh you can\u2019t write a song. 'She\u2019s really good so\u2026 They\u2019re good songs. So I\u2019m lucky in that sense.'
