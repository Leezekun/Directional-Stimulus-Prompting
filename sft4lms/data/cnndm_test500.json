Jose Mourinho, pictured on the Chelsea bench during their win against Stoke, has sided with Arsene Wenger . Cristiano Ronaldo, winner of the Ballon d'Or on three occasions, is presented with last year's award . Lionel Messi, who finished runner-up to Ronaldo in 2014, has previously won the compeition three times . Speaking last year, Wenger said he was \u2018totally against\u2019 the Ballon d\u2019Or, and in a wide-ranging interview with the Telegraph, Mourinho moved to side with his great Premier League rival. \u2018I think Wenger said something that is interesting; he is against the Ballon d\u2019Or, and I think he\u2019s right, because in this moment football is losing a little bit the concept of the team to focus more on the individual,\u2019 said Mourinho. \u2018We are always looking at the individual performance, the individual stat, the player that runs more. Because you run 11km in a game and I run nine you did a better job than I did? Maybe not! Maybe my 9km were more important than your 11.\u2019 Arsene Wenger and Mourinho have clashed on a number of occasions during their managerial careers . Eden Hazard is congratulated by his Chelsea team-mates after scoring in their victory against Stoke City . Ronaldo beat Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Manuel Neuer, of Bayern Munich, to this year\u2019s award which was presented to the former Manchester United star in December. It is the third time he has been honoured with the gong. The second of his triumphs came when he was playing under Mourinho at Madrid. \u2018For me, football is collective,' added Mourinho, whose Chelsea team travel to Loftus Road on Sunday as they bid to be crowned Premier League champions. 'The individual is welcome if you want to make our group better. But you have to work for us, not we have to work for you. 'When the top player arrives, the team is already there.

Amy-Beth Ellice, 17, from Essex started baking at the age of three and landed her first book deal with her recipe collection Amy's Baking Year at just 14. Her second, all about entertaining, is now firmly in the works but the teenager has her sights set even higher - with plans to launch her own baking products and even become a TV chef. Already baking at five years old Amy-Beth (left) is pictured with sister\u00a0Lara-Jayne, 10 . Amy-Beth started baking at three-years-old and published her first cookbook, Amy's Baking Year, at age 13 . Amy-Beth most recently hosted a cupcake-making class in Harrods, London. Britain's youngest published baker, who counts Pixie Lott and Katherine Jenkins among her fans, delighted a crowd with her recent demonstration. She then signed copies of her debut cookbook in the Toy Kingdom department for thrilled shoppers. Amy-Beth also has a regular column in OK! magazine and continues to supply other publications with tips and recipes. The keen cook, who attends Newhall School in Chelmsford full-time, makes bespoke baked goods to order in her spare time, during summer holidays and half term. But it seems the talented young baker gets it all from her mother Gillian, who taught Amy and her other daughter Lara-Jayne, 22, how to make cakes. Amy gets decorating as she shows onlookers how to perfect cupcakes at a London presentation . The young cook pictured with fans at her Harrods book signing and cupcake masterclass . Amy picked up a particular knack for baking and continued to experiment until she soon took full control of the kitchen and the entertaining. Gillian told MailOline: 'When she was little Amy showed an interest and passion, as I did when I was a child, in cooking and baking. 'She watched me cook all meals and bake birthday cakes for many members of our family from scratch. 'I always preferred to make my own cakes as I knew exactly what was going in them, they tasted nicer and they were (and still are) much appreciated. 'Amy soon wanted to venture out on her own and at aged 12 she asked if she could bake her sister Lara-Jayne's cake for her 17th birthday. 'I had planned a simple chocolate sponge cake but Amy, being more adventurous, single-handedly created a two-tiered cake covered in roll-out fondant icing. 'She then decorated it with heart shaped biscuits on sticks, which later became a recipe in her book (lollipop biscuits). 'She has quite literally surpassed me in the kitchen, a fact that I'm both proud and amazed at. 'It is sometimes hard to get into the kitchen now as Amy is often experimenting with recipes, baking for charity cake sales, or helping preparing for a party or event we are organising.' Her inventive bakes are remarkable for her age. Amy designed and made a pony-themed cake for a teacher at age 12. At age 14 she was commissioned by another teacher to make a three-tiered lace effect wedding cake. She finally baked it in chocolate at age 16 using carrot, pineapple and lemon flavours. A mini oven at Christmas could certainly have helped ignite Amy's passion for cake making . When she was little Amy showed an interest and passion in cooking and baking . Amy launched a cupcake and cake business at age 13 with the help of her mother, as they both thought they could make better cakes than what was already out there. The teenager said: 'I made cupcakes for regular clients as well as celebrity functions and after parties and it grew from there. 'After having seven of my recipes published in a national newspaper weekend supplements, I approached a few publishers with a mock-up of the ideas I had for my book and got the book deal at age 14.' Her book, Amy's Baking Year, features recipes themed around the four seasons and occasions such as\u00a0for Mother's Day, Easter, Halloween and Christmas. Amy launched a cupcake and cake business at age 13 with the help of her mother Gillian, as they both thought they could make better cakes than what was already out there . This catapulted Amy into the limelight of the baking world and opened up multiple doors for her . From cute cupcakes, French macarons, cookies, tarts and classic sponge cakes, to sticky puddings, jams and gingerbread - plus Amy's highly sought after 'perfect cupcake' recipe - there is an indulgent treat to suit every occasion. With a focus on family, the recipes are designed for both seasoned bakers and young enthusiasts. Amy's Baking Year features Amy's selected easy-to-follow recipes themed around the four seasons . The beautifully illustrated book also features tips on the perfect decoration and setting for each bake. She says: 'I have been brought up cooking and baking by my mum who is also a talented home cook and baker, as were her parents who both worked in catering.' A few of the recipes in the book such as my Grandad's Coconut Ice, and Aunty Lynn's Fudge have been passed down to Amy from members of her family. She continues:\u00a0'While I was at home experimenting with recipes my friends were spending their time on social media. 'It was something that I was passionate about so really enjoyed spending my time focusing on it. 'I think it's important that we return to traditional values and that what I try to get across through my cooking. 'The art of cooking and eating healthily is important to me, so I'm very conscious of the ingredients I cook with, but I think we're becoming too calorie obsessed. That being said I try not to eat everything I bake.' She is juggling her lucrative cooking career around studying for her A-levels in English literature, art and music. 'The school I attend doesn't offer cookery as an A Level. I hope to go on to train at Le Cordon Bleu in the future after I have finished school.'

His signature in the summer of 2004 coincided with Mourinho's arrival in west London, and the Czech stopper has become a Chelsea stalwart. Currently out of the team due to Thibaut Courtois' emergence, and his manager will reportedly let him leave Stamford Bridge. Petr Cech has formed himself a legendary reputation at Chelsea during 11 years at the club . Sergio Ramos - Right back . A stalwart for 10 years in Real Madrid's defence, Sergio Ramos was a key part of Mourinho's title-winning side in 2011-2. Sergio Ramos has been a star at the back for Real Madrid for 10 years . John Terry - Centre back . The Chelsea captain seemingly keeps getting better under Mourinho, with major lapses in form only usually occurring when the 52-year-old isn't in charge. John Terry has captained Chelsea whenever Mourinho has been in charge at the club . Centre back - Lucio . The Brazilian beast was one of the fiercest defenders of the past decade, winning everything in the game at club and international level. And he was superb for Mourinho during their Treble-winning time together at Inter in 2010. Lucio was one of the best central defenders of the past decade, especially during his time at Inter . Left back - Ashley Cole . A England's greatest left back of a generation, he may not have played under Mourinho for too long, but he was still undoubtedly one of the top performers for the Blues under the Portuguese. Ashley Cole played under Mourinho during both of his stints at Stamford Bridge . Centre midfield - Michael Essien . There was a stage during Michael Essien's peak where he was one of the best midfielders in the Premier League and the world. Even when he declined in later years, Mourinho still saw fit to bring him to Real Madrid. Midfielder Michael Essien in action during his time playing for Chelsea . Centre midfield - Frank Lampard . Another one of Mourinho's stalwarts, was a key man with goals from midfield during a dominant first spell in charge for the Portuguese boss at Chelsea. He may have let him go last summer, but Jose obviously still loves Lampard. Frank Lampard and Jose Mourinho embrace after victory in the Champions League against Barcelona in 2005 . Left wing - Eden Hazard . They've had their run-ins in the past, but it's clear Mourinho hasn't had many more talented players than this Belgian winger, who is firing the Blues towards the title. Hazard recently signed a new long-term deal so is clearly happy under this boss. Eden Hazard is the youngest member in this side and is firing Chelsea towards the Premier League title . Attacking midfield - Wesley Sneijder . Under Mourinho, Sneijder emerged as one of the best attacking midfielders in the world. The Dutchman was superb as Inter stormed to the Treble in 2010, and it's fair to say he hasn't looked like the same player since they split. Wesley Sneijder playing for Inter Milan, he was a star for Mourinho during their Treble winning campaign . Right wing - Cristiano Ronaldo . What more can you say? Ronaldo recently scored his 300th goal for Real Madrid, and flourished while working with the 'Special One' at the Bernabeu. The Portuguese duo certainly get on. Cristiano Ronaldo enjoyed his time working with his Portuguese compatriot at the Bernabeu . Striker - Didier Drogba . Mourinho recently described Drogba as his best buy at any club, so it's no surprise to see the Ivorian make the list. He arrived in England as a petulant forward with a lot to prove, and is now a Chelsea legend in his second spell at the club.

She lived in a Buddhist monastery, helped rebuild a sea wall in Fiji, then went to India and worked with Nepalese refugees. There, she met a young girl who wanted to find her family in Nepal. Doyne went with her. That's when Doyne's life took an unexpected turn. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for CNN Heroes 2015 . A decade-long civil war had just ended in the country, and Doyne witnessed its effects firsthand. She met women and children who were suffering, struggling to survive. \"It changed me,\" said Doyne, now 28. \"There were children with mallets that would go into the riverbed, pick up a big stone and break it into little, little pieces (to sell).\u00a0And they were doing that all day, every day.\" Doyne called her parents and asked them to wire her the $5,000 she had earned babysitting. In 2006, she purchased land in Surkhet, a district in western Nepal. She worked for two years with the local community to build the Kopila Valley Children's Home. Today, Kopila -- which means \"flower bud\" in Nepali -- is home to about 50 children, from infants to teenagers. Doyne started the BlinkNow Foundation to support and grow her efforts. In 2010, the group opened its Kopila Valley School, which today educates more than 350 students. Doyne lives in Nepal year-round, traveling to the U.S. a few times a year. See more CNN Heroes . The CNN Heroes team traveled to Surkhet and talked to Doyne about her work and the community she supports. Below is an edited version of their conversation. CNN: How does it work, raising nearly 50 kids? Maggie Doyne: It's communal living, for sure! We're a family of almost 50 kids ages 8 months to 16 years. Everybody just pitches in and helps each other. They all have their chores. They all have their duties. And everybody cooks the meals together and makes sure that they do their part to make the home run smoothly. The staff at the home, we call them the aunties and the uncles. We wake up in the morning and go off to school. And then come home and do homework and eat our meals together, and everybody goes to bed at night. CNN: How does a child come to live in your home? Doyne: Our first priority as an organization is to keep a child with their family if at all possible. In order to come into the home, you need to have lost both parents, or in some rare cases have suffered extreme neglect, abuse or have a parent who's incarcerated. We have to conduct a full investigation. So usually that involves going to the child's village, making calls, doing police checks, getting documentation and paperwork. We have to dig up birth certificates, death certificates, make sure that everything lines up the way that they say it does. CNN: Meanwhile, you have 350 children attending your school. What is their background? Doyne: Every single year we'll get from 1,000 to 1,500 applicants. And we choose the ones who are the most needful and really won't be in school without us. Most of them live in one room, a mud hut. A lot of them are just in survival mode. We try to relieve the burden from the family, so that the child has food, medical care, books, zero fees for education. CNN: What have you learned working with the local community in Nepal? Doyne: I learned very early on, from the beginning, that I couldn't come in and just be like, \"Here, I have a vision. This is what we're going to do.\" That doesn't work. It has to be slow; it has to be organic. And it has to come from the community and be a \"we\" thing. It's really important to me that this is a Nepali project, working for Nepal, for the community. So the faces that you see are strong Nepali women and amazing Nepali role-model men. CNN: How does the project continue to grow? Doyne: We started with the home and then school. We run the school lunch program. Then we needed to keep our kids really healthy, so we started a small clinic and then a counseling center. From there we started getting more sustainable and growing our own food. And then from there we decided to start a women's center. We just bought a new piece of property to create a totally green and sustainable off-the-grid campus. This year we converted to solar energy. So we'll have a high school and then a day care, preschool, elementary, all the way up, and a vocational center where kids can become a thriving young adult with everything they need to succeed moving forward. It's become so much more than just a little girl with a backpack and a big dream. It's become a community. And I want to teach and have other people take this example and hope this sets a precedent for what our world can be and look like. Want to get involved?

But while one rots my teeth and piles on the pounds, the other - no matter how bad my hair day - makes me feel beautiful. I'm in good company. Cleopatra was known for her love of perfume, liberally applying lotus and rose oil to her upper lip. 'We know she made her own perfumes and would certainly have worn it to increase her powers of seduction,' says Mandy Aftel, perfume historian and author of Fragrant: The Secret Life Of Scent. 'She didn't solely rely on her looks. Cleopatra believed that smelling divine was the real key to a man's heart,' she says. And according to scientists, Cleopatra was right. Perfume really can make us more attractive. 'Humans are mammals and though we're highly evolved, we have inherited mating mechanisms from the animal kingdom. One of the factors that influences our partner choice is smell,' says Tim Jacob, emeritus professor at the School of Biosciences at Cardiff University. We react in an involuntary way to smell because our noses are connected to synapses in the unconscious part of the brain (the piriform cortex), which governs the subconscious mind. 'The power of the subconscious mind is extremely strong. If we like someone's smell, they become instantly more attractive to us, and vice versa,' says Roja Dove, master perfumer at Urban Retreat Perfumerie in Harrods. Small wonder, then, that perfumers spend vast amounts of time and money creating fragrances that evoke positive feelings of satisfaction and sensuality. And there are ingredients with a proven track record of evoking other strong subconscious reactions. Perfumers spend vast amounts of time and money creating fragrances that evoke positive feelings of satisfaction and sensuality . 'Vanilla, an ingredient in many perfumes, is a smell that's strongly associated with pleasure,' says Professor Jacob. 'Just think of confectionery and the feelings of happiness that go with traditional childhood treats.' Lavender, another common ingredient in perfume, has been shown to calm and soothe the mind, while citrus smells evoke images of health and cleanliness. So powerful is our unconscious reaction to smell that perfumers claim wearing certain scents will make a woman seem younger, more athletic or even slimmer than she actually is. So what are the perfect perfumes to make others think we're slim, sexy, sporty or sophisticated? Harrods' Roja Dove picks his favourites . . . FLIRT WITH FLORALS . Floral perfumes can take years off a woman, as long as the smell is subtle. However, if it's cloying or overpowering, the effect can be ageing. Anything that overwhelms our senses can begin to smell stale and musty, and these are scents that the unconscious mind associates with age. Vivacious yet subtle scents of peony, lily of the valley and orange blossom will evoke images of spring and youth. Perfumes such as Balenciaga's Florabotanica (\u00a356, Debenhams) or Love Story from Chloe (\u00a365, Debenhams) use floral notes that create an impression of youthful energy. They're flirty and fun, like actresses Helen Mirren and Felicity Kendal. RAMP UP YOUR SEX APPEAL . Vanilla is an aphrodisiac that enhances sensations of pleasure across the central nervous system. Therefore, it's no wonder that so many perfumes use vanilla as a base note. Perfumes with a bright, breezy, citrus scent evoke images of health, youth and the outdoors . Applied to the nape of the neck or dabbed lightly behind the ears, the smell is intensely seductive. For serious sex appeal you need a slightly heavier scent, one which comes from the perfume group we call the Orientals. These are perfumes based on vanilla with touches of sandalwood, patchouli or coumarin, which is found in conker beans. The fragrances are sensual - they speak of arousal and passion. Think rich, luxuriant velvet as opposed to bright, clean cotton. Try Guerlain's Shalimar, (\u00a362, John Lewis), L'Ambre Des Merveilles by Hermes (\u00a382, House of Fraser) or Armani's Si (\u00a364, John Lewis) for a date night your husband won't forget. WAFT AWAY\u00a0THE YEARS . Perfumes with a bright, breezy, citrus scent evoke images of health, youth and the outdoors. Lemon has long been associated with a fresh, youthful vivacity, so perfumes with citrus notes combined with florals will have associations of vigour and energy. Opt for perfumes such as Tom Ford's Private Blend White Suede (\u00a3142, John Lewis) or Givenchy's Dahlia Noir (\u00a363, Boots) to knock the pounds off in an instant. You may never run a marathon, but you'll smell like someone who does (in a good way). SMART AND SASSY AROMAS . If you've got a tricky meeting or job interview, you'll want to appear calm, competent and chic. The fragrance equivalent of an exquisitely tailored Chanel suit is a perfume from the Chypre family. This group of fragrances is blended with uncompromising clarity, made up primarily of woody scents: juniper, cedarwood and bergamot and citrus top notes. Nearly 80 per cent of\u00a0women who use\u00a0fragrance\u00a0own\u00a0two to ten\u00a0bottles . Cartier's Eau De Cartier (\u00a346, House of Fraser) or Bottega Veneta Essence Aromatique (\u00a360, John Lewis) are perfect examples of understated statement perfumes. If a perfume can make you appear to be the sort of person who reads Proust at bedtime rather than Hello! magazine, it's going to be one of these. GIVE YOURSELF A MOOD LIFT . Clean, energising citrus notes with hints of healing, soothing jasmine and lavender work best to dispel gloom, spread joy and your spirits. These scents have been shown to have anti-depressant and rebalancing effects. It really is true that a little lavender essence sprinkled on your pillow at night will help you sleep peacefully, leaving you calm and re-energised for the day ahead. Try Clarins' Eau Dynamisante (\u00a339, John Lewis), Fendi's L'Aquarossa (\u00a364, Harrods) or, for a really lovely lavender feel, Marc Jacobs' Daisy Eau So Fresh (\u00a372, Debenhams).", "reference": "According to scientists, perfume really can make us more attractive .\nLavender has been shown to calm and soothe the mind .\nCitrus smells evoke images of health and cleanliness ."}, "7": {"id": "1ff8c8edc0a8cada6ed3f18a3f3bfb4b74217f66", "article": "V Stiviano showed off two new accessories while enjoying lunch in Los Angeles on Thursday.

The Italian restaurant, owned by chef Giacomino Drago, is known for its celebrity clientele, and is a favorite of stars including the Hiltons and Kardashians. Stiviano was also showing off a new hairstyle for the outing as well, with her normally straight hair very curly and looking particularly full. She also appeared to receive a present from her gentleman friend at one point, pulling something out of a pink bag. Meanwhile, a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge is set to decide if Stiviano must return gifts to her ex Sterlung after he and his wife Shelly took her to court. Shelly laid out some of the items in a court document, including a $1.8million home, $1.2million in cash, $400,000 in cars and even a $12 lace thong. The couple want back the house and another $1million. It was Stiviano who recorded the now-infamous conversation with Donald Sterling in which he berated her for associating with black people and urged her not to bring minorities with her to Clippers basketball games. In the furor sparked when the remarks were made public, the NBA banned Sterling from the league for life, and he was ultimately forced to sell the Clippers franchise he had owned for 33 years for a record $2billion.

The \u2018hospital waiting-room-style\u2019 signs are needed as rising numbers of staff are subjected to swearing and physical attacks from pupils and their families. Research from the NASUWT union shows that the majority of teachers today are verbally abused by pupils. Union officials from NASUWT say the \u2018hospital waiting-room-style\u2019 signs are needed as rising numbers of staff are subjected to swearing and physical attacks from pupils and their families . The behaviour of some youngsters \u2013 who hurl chairs, bring fireworks to school and threaten to slit other pupils\u2019 throats \u2013 is so horrendous that staff have refused to teach them. Some 82 per cent of 3,500 NASUWT members polled were verbally abused by pupils in the last 12 months, up from 52 per cent in the union\u2019s survey last year. Meanwhile 38 per cent suffered similar problems with parents or carers compared with 24 per cent in 2014. Some 23 per cent had received threats of physical assault from a pupil, up ten percentage points, and 16 per cent had actually been attacked. This was a rise of seven percentage points on last year. Some 82 per cent of 3,500 NASUWT members polled were verbally abused by pupils in the last 12 months, up from 52 per cent in the union\u2019s survey last year . NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates blamed factors including a narrow curriculum, rising class sizes and a lack of parental support for the growing tide of indiscipline. Speaking ahead of the union\u2019s annual conference, which opened in Cardiff yesterday, she called on the government to produce poster templates for schools, using \u2018strong messages\u2019. \u2018Increasingly, you go into railway stations and you see these posters which are basically saying we don\u2019t tolerate our staff being abused,\u2019 she said. Violent and disruptive pupils led the union to hold eight so-called refusal to teach ballots in schools last year. Here are some of the worst cases: . Birmingham . A Year One boy (age 6-7) was not excluded despite a history of physical assaults against staff and other pupils. Following notice of NASUWT action, the boy was removed from the school roll. Cardiff . A Year Ten pupil (age 14-15) verbally assaulted a woman teacher and threw a book which hit her face and drew blood. He was not expelled. Following notice of intention to ballot, the boy was assigned a learning support assistant at all times and was barred from the teacher\u2019s lessons. Glasgow . An 11-year-old boy with a history of physical assaults, verbal abuse and threats of violence to teachers hurled chairs and other objects, but was excluded for only two days. The local authority moved him to another school after the NASUWT\u2019s notice of intention to ballot. \u2018You go into hospitals and you see similar posters, yet the government draws back from wanting to promote that kind of thing in schools.\u2019 Miss Keates said that teachers are seen to be \u2018exempt from that kind of protection and respect\u2019. However, posters that tell \u2018anyone using the premises \u2013 pupils, visitors, parents \u2013 that staff are not there to be abused\u2019 give an \u2018important message\u2019. Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the posters were a \u2018good idea but shouldn\u2019t be forced\u2019 on schools. It comes after the NASUWT launched eight \u2018refusal to teach\u2019 ballots last year due to pupils being allowed back into the classroom despite their abysmal behaviour. In Gwynedd, north-west Wales, a 14-year-old girl was only temporarily suspended after threatening to slit another girl\u2019s throat at a funfair and making a similar threat at school. She was expelled following the NASUWT\u2019s ballot notice. Overall, 73 per cent of union members in this year\u2019s survey believed there was a \u2018widespread behaviour problem in schools\u2019. The main causes of misbehaviour were lack of parental support (61 per cent) and pupils coming to school not ready to learn (44 per cent).", "reference": "Schools should display posters warning pupils to respect teachers .\nUnion officials say signs are needed as increasing number of staff abused .\nAround 82% of NASUWT members were verbally abused by pupils in 2014 .\nA further 23% were\u00a0threatened\u00a0with violence and 16% were attacked ."}, "9": {"id": "896fe2bda2ed445306c8fd005e8f11288b805eb6", "article": "It is a common fear, known as trypanophobia. For around 20 per cent of the population, the thought of going to the doctors for an injection invokes a deep-rooted sense of dread. Many avoid the doctor's surgery altogether, leaving themselves open to the risk of various illnesses and infections. But for those terrified of needles, a team of scientists at Rice University in Houston, may have the answer. They have developed a new device, Comfortably Numb, to ease the pain of an injection. Their invention numbs the skin prior to the jab by producing a rapid chemical reaction to cool the patient's skin. Scroll down for video . Comfortably Numb is a new, single-use device that eases the pain of an injection by producing a rapid chemical reaction to cool the patient's skin within 60 seconds . Three first year students, (from L-R) mechanical engineer Mike Hua, bioengineer Andy Zhang and computer scientist Greg Allison, came up with the invention, they describe as 'simple and elegant' The trio, made up of computer scientist Greg Allison, bioengineer Andy Zhang and mechanical engineer Mike Hua, currently has a functioning prototype, that has produced a numbing effect in just 60 seconds. 'Our device is 3D printed and consists of two sealed chambers containing the chemical ammonium nitrate and water, ' Mr Hua said. 'A simple twisting motion moves the chambers into alignment to allow the chemicals to flow through the chamber to produce a rapid endothermic reaction. 'We then numb the skin by contacting the device's metal surface to the patient's skin.' Current solutions are either ineffective because they fail to numb the skin adequately, or take too long, the researchers said. They noted that a commonly used medicated topical patch takes about an hour to work, whereas their new device 'works on the order of seconds and minutes', Mr Zhang said. 'We are targeting anyone who has to get an injection, which is nearly everyone,' Mr Allison said. 'But the device is especially applicable to people who are more susceptible to pain.' As such, he said, it is particularly useful for children and the elderly. And, it is intended for use during procedures 'where you have to get shots in more sensitive areas of the body, such as the face or the groin', he added. The team designed the device to be single-use, rather than reusable to avoid the difficulties of cleaning it and resetting the device. It costs around $2 (\u00a31.34) to produce, they said . The trio said the device could also be used to ease the pain of ear piercings and tattooing, and help reduce swelling. 'We looked into all sorts of methods for numbing, both quick and long-term, chemicals, using ice packs - which is similar to what we're using now,' Mr Hua said. The device is 3D printed and consists of two sealed chambers containing the chemical ammonium nitrate and water. A simple twisting motion moves the chambers into alignment to allow the chemicals to flow through the chamber to produce a rapid endothermic reaction. The skin can then be numbed by contacting the device's metal surface to the patient's skin. Within 60 seconds the patient's skin is numb and they can have an injection without experiencing pain. 'We explored everything that surrounded the problem before we even began brainstorming.' 'At the end of the day, what we're creating is a self-contained device with a very cold contact surface, and there are many applications for that,' Mr Allison added. Some of the solutions the trio researched were highly technical and required a materials science degree, or skills the first-year students had not yet learned. 'That's the kind of amazing thing about our project,' Mr Allison said. 'Because we don't have these incredibly refined skills in certain areas, that meant we had to think of very simple solutions. 'Being limited in that way led to something that is very novel and innovative, but at the same time, simple and elegant.' The team designed the device to be single-use, rather than reusable to avoid the difficulties of cleaning it and resetting the device. Mr Zhang, said: 'The materials that we use are relatively inexpensive and found in abundance: plastic, rubber and metal. The team from Rice University in Houston said the device could be used in future for those having tattoos, or people wanting to get their ears pierced without suffering the pain . 'The materials for one of these cost about a quarter, and then we just had to do estimates based on how much manufacturing would cost. 'We compared our device to similar things already in production, and we've estimated the cost at about $2 (\u00a31.34).' The team is currently in the process of applying for a provisional patent for the device, and the students hope to continue their work together in their spare time when they return to Rice in their second year. 'As a team, we just want to follow the project, because we think it has a lot of potential. I think that's what drew us to this specific project,' Mr Allison said. 'We haven't really discussed yet whether we're going dedicate to making this a company, but it's something we're open to.'", "reference": "Comfortably Numb is a single-use 3D printed device that numbs the skin .\nProduces a rapid chemical reaction to cool the patient's skin in 60 seconds .\nInvention costs around $2 to make and could help millions terrified of pain .\nThree first-year students behind invention say it could work for tattoos too ."}, "10": {"id": "180b18e760b0d1344e122948d8f69dd7a12df0db", "article": "What Jason Holder did in Antigua and Marlon Samuels managed here will do much for the culture Phil Simmons is trying to create as new West Indies coach. They will inspire their team-mates with their discipline, character and application, just as Mike Atherton inspired me with the way he batted to save a Test in Johannesburg and in his famous battle with Allan Donald at Trent Bridge. This is an era in which West Indies are losing players to the easier option of the Indian Premier League and it is understandable because of the money that can be made there. Why shouldn\u2019t they cash in? Marlon Samuels (right)  celebrates reaching his century for West Indies in second Test . But Samuels has taken the difficult road. It is all well and good going off and having a bit of a hit and giggle but he will take a lot more satisfaction from the way he has taken on the moving ball in a demanding Test match. These are the types of innings you remember when you retire. He will remember his duel with Ben Stokes, the way he saw off a newish ball and how he took the attack to England on the first evening. He did finally fall to Jimmy Anderson after a loose shot but by that time Samuels had grafted his way to 103. That is what you get in Test cricket. This is far harder than going off towards the end of your career and enjoying an IPL sunset. I never played in an easy Test. There is no easy option during five hard-fought days and that\u2019s why this game gives you far more satisfaction than you will ever get over 50 or 20 overs. It gets me down to hear people saying \u2018wasn\u2019t Antigua boring\u2019 or \u2018these pitches are just too dead and the cricket is slow\u2019. Just give this time. The Test England won in the dark of Karachi was remembered for years because it was the ultimate conclusion to three hard Tests. The same could happen here. I can see a lot of our England side of 2000 in this West Indies team. We could not become a winning side straight away. West Indies batsman Samuels grafted his way to 103 against England in the second Test . We had to stay in games, instil a bit of pride and discipline before we could think about being positive and that\u2019s what Simmons is trying to do here. The first step is to take Tests into five days and once that is achieved then West Indies can think about moving on and hopefully keeping their best players. The seven days we have had so far in this series may not have satisfied those who prefer their gratification instant but I have enjoyed it. This is not to denigrate Twenty20 or what we saw at the World Cup but there is something fulfilling about seeing a match go to the fifth day as in Antigua, with England bowling 130 overs and trying to find different ways to take 10 wickets. We live in a modern world of instant news where Test cricket seems something of a throwback but there is still great satisfaction to be taken from a slow burner. Ben Stokes was admonished by umpire Steve Davis following clash with Samuels . I find the mental side of Test cricket to be unparalleled. To be Jonathan Trott, for instance, getting a duck in his first innings after waiting to get back in for 18 months. Then he has to spend the best part of two days fielding and sweating on a pair. You can\u2019t replicate that in any other form of the game. Someone like Alastair Cook has to tackle a technical issue, having been found out by opponents, and has the mental battle to overcome it. There is the physical challenge of a bowling attack spending all that time in the heat trying to bowl a side out and then having to go through it all again. In Twenty20 you can have a bit of a slog, edge through the slips for four to get you off and running and then get caught on the boundary which is supposed to happen in the short game. I thoroughly enjoy the different attractions of limited-overs cricket. But Test cricket is what players will be remembered for.

Sitting alone in his den, the beautiful large tiger is pictured sitting proudly in the shade. Unusually it wasn't just the tiger cub that seemed to be the big talking point from new photo. A few social media users appear to be more concerned by the fighter's apparent lack of facial hair in the photo.

'The train company are experts, not me or my friend and they have calculated it on a basis that if someone commits a fraud like this defendant has committed, you are not allowed to calculate it on the basis of a weekly ticket, you calculate it on a full single fare, of the return for the day, each and every day this defendant travelled over the period without a full price rail ticket'. Barnett admits six counts of fraud by false representation between April 2012 and November last year. Barnett claimed to have\u00a0travelled from Wembley, in North West London, instead of Thame, Oxfordshire . The scam began to unravel for Barnett when he was stopped by a ticket inspector at Marylebone last November. The Rhodes scholar claimed to have travelled from Wembley, instead of Thame, Oxfordshire, where he and his wife live in a \u00a3550,000 five-bedroom detached home. Barnett was sent to the excess fares window but another member of staff became suspicious and decided to contact his supervisor. When he turned his back Barnett ran away, but was apparently overcome with guilt and confessed the next day. An investigation was carried out by British Transport Police, which found the lawyer had dodged fares since April 2012. The lawyer was cautioned for an identical offence in 2010 but continued to break the law, despite his prestigious reputation as the founder of an African children's charity and director of leading think-tank, the Legatum Institute Foundation, aimed at 'promoting prosperity'. A court heard how the barrister got off at London Marylebone (pictured) by tapping out with an Oyster card . It is understood he did so by boarding a train at Haddenham and Thame Parkway without a ticket, and then getting off at Marylebone by simply tapping out with an Oyster card. Because there was no start point to his journey, the automated system charged him the maximum Transport for London fare, which is currently \u00a37.60. But this is still far less than the \u00a319.80 price of a single peak time journey from his home. The case was adjourned until July 27 so a hearing can be held to determine the loss caused to Chiltern Railways. Barnett was released on unconditional bail. The deception places him among the ranks of Britain's biggest fare dodgers, closely behind a former millionaire fund manager. Jonathan Burrows was banned from working in the City last year after avoiding \u00a343,000 in train fares from his home in Stonegate, East Sussex. Burrows had hoped to keep his name out of the public eye and avoid prosecution by quickly reimbursing Southeastern trains the full amount in unpaid tickets, accrued over five years, within three days of being caught.", "reference": "Peter Barnett, 43, travelled from Haddenham and Thame to Marylebone .\nBut pretended to have gone from Wembley and tapped out with Oyster card .\nDeception places him among the ranks of Britain's biggest fare dodgers .\nOxford University-educated lawyer has\u00a0admitted to six counts of fraud ."}, "15": {"id": "94d0708e5cb80928fb6714445dfcb7e4d1848ac4", "article": "Unleashing your inner Shakespeare could be just a few jolts of electricity away. Researchers in North Carolina claim that zapping the brain with a mild electric current can boost creativity by nearly eight per cent. They tested their theory using a 10-Hertz current on the brain's of 20 volunteers to stimulate the brain's natural alpha wave oscillations. Researchers in North Carolina claim that zapping the brain with a mild electric current can boost creativity by nearly eight per cent . As well as creativity, these oscillations - or the lack of them - are linked with depression. Flavio Frohlich, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of North Carolina said: 'If we could enhance these brain activity patterns, then we could potentially help many people.' Alpha oscillations occur within the frequency range of eight and 12 Hertz 9 (or cycles per second). They were discovered in 1929 by Hans Berger, who invented EEG. Alpha oscillations happen most prominently when we close our eyes and shut out sensory stimuli \u2013 things we see, feel, taste, smell, and hear. When alpha oscillations are active, your sensory inputs might be offline as you daydream, meditate, or conjure ideas. When you come fully online, alpha oscillations disappear. Other oscillations at higher frequencies, such as gamma oscillations, take over. An EEG of a naturally occurring alpha oscillation in a human brain. Enhancing these electric oscillations may help treat people with depression, scientists claim . They tested their theory using a 10-Hertz current run through electrodes attached to the scalp on 20 volunteers to stimulate the brain's natural alpha wave oscillations. They then recorded the results using EEG . Knowing this, other researchers began associating alpha oscillations with creativity. Professor Frohlich set out to find evidence. His idea was simple. If he could enhance the rhythmic patterns of alpha oscillations to improve creativity. For the study, Professor Frohlich's team enrolled 20 healthy adults. Researchers placed electrodes on each side of each participant's frontal scalp and a third electrode toward the back of the scalp. An experimental technique used to boost brain performance with electrical pulses can actually cause people to perform less well in some tasks, scientists have found. The technology, known as transcranial direct current stimulation, is already being marketed in commercial products as a way of helping computer game players and athletes improve their focus. However, new research from the University of Oxford suggests that the benefits of this technique, which stimulates activity in the brain with an electrical current, may be limited by personality as it appears to only be helpful to people who are stressed about performing a task. They found that while electrical stimulation helped those who lacked confidence or were anxious about performing a series of sums, it caused those who did not fear mathematics to decline. A follow up study that examined how volunteers fared at spotting which way an arrow was pointing on a screen when confronted with distracting information showed that all those who received stimulation performed more poorly. This way, the 10-Hertz alpha oscillation stimulation for each side of the cortex would be in unison. Each participant underwent two sessions. During one session, researchers used a 10-Hertz sham stimulation for just five minutes. Participants felt a tingle at the start of the five minutes. For the next 25 minutes, each participant continued to take the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking. In one task, each participant was shown a small fraction of an illustration \u2013 sometimes just a bent line on a piece of paper. Participants used the line to complete an illustration, and they wrote a title when they finished. In the other session each participant underwent the same protocol, except they were stimulated at 10 Hertz for the entire 30 minutes while doing the Torrance test. The tingling sensation only occurred at the start of the stimulation, ensuring that each participant did not know which session was the control session. Then Frohlich's team compared each participant's creativity score, they found participants scored an average 7.4 percentage points higher than they did during the control sessions. 'That's a pretty big difference when it comes to creativity,' Frohlich said. 'Several participants showed incredible improvements in creativity. It was a very clear effect.' 'We don't know if there are long-term safety concerns,' he said. 'We did a well-controlled, one-time study and found an acute effect.' 'Also, I have strong ethical concerns about cognitive enhancement for healthy adults, just as sports fans might have concerns about athletic enhancement through the use of performance-enhancing drugs.'", "reference": "Researchers ran a 10-Hertz current through brains of 20 volunteers .\nThey wanted to stimulate alpha wave oscillations linked to creativity .\nThese oscillations are thought to be impaired in people with depression .\nTeam are now hoping to use the technique to treat depressed people ."}, "16": {"id": "10df276b0775dd707d56c6ef6aa3ec9e70f74adb", "article": "(CNN)Whether a patient is in the hospital for an organ transplant, an appendectomy or to have a baby, one complaint is common: the gown. You know the one. It might as well have been stitched together with paper towels and duct tape, and it usually leaves the wearer's behind hanging out. \"You're at the hospital because something's wrong with you --  you're vulnerable -- then you get to wear the most vulnerable garment ever invented to make the whole experience that much worse,\" said Ted Streuli, who lives in Edmond, Okla., and has had to wear hospital gowns on multiple occasions. Put another way: \"They are horrible. They are demeaning. They are belittling. They are disempowering,\" said Camilla McRory of Olney, Md. Hospital gowns have gotten a face-lift after some help from fashion designers like these from Patient Style and the Henry Ford Innovation Institute. The gowns are among the most vexing parts of being in the hospital. But if efforts by some health systems are an indicator, the design may be on its way out of style. The Cleveland Clinic was an early trendsetter. In 2010, it introduced new gowns after being prompted by the CEO, who often heard patient complaints when he was a practicing heart surgeon. That feedback led to a search for something new, said Adrienne Boissy, chief experience officer at the hospital system. The prominent academic medical center ultimately sought the help of fashion icon Diane von Furstenberg, settling on a reversible gown with a front and back V-neck, complete derriere coverage, and features such as pockets, softer fabric and a new bolder print pattern. Patients \"loved the gowns,\" Boissy said. \"People felt much more comfortable in the new design, not just physically but emotionally.\" In recent years, she added, \"hospitals are looking at everything they do and trying to evaluate whether or not it contributes to enhancing the patient experience.\" It's all part of a trend among hospitals to improve the patient reviews and their own bottom lines -- fueled in part by the health law's focus on quality of care and other federal initiatives. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services increasingly factors patients' satisfaction into its quality measures, which are linked to the size of Medicare payments hospitals get. Sometimes the efforts involve large capital improvement projects. But they can also mean making waiting rooms more comfortable, improving the quality of food served to patients or, as in this case, updating hospital gowns. Ultimately, this focus leads to \"a better patient experience,\" said John Combes, senior vice president of the American Hospital Association. The Detroit-based Henry Ford Health System is in the process of updating its gowns, an initiative that began when the system's innovation institute challenged students at the city's College for Creative Studies to identify and offer a solution to one hospital problem. The students responded with the suggestion to redo the garment that has often been described by patients as flimsy, humiliating, indecent and itchy. The process took three years, but last fall, the institute unveiled a new and improved version. It's made of warmer fabric -- a cotton blend -- that wraps around a patient's body like a robe and comes in navy and light blue, the hospital's signature colors. Patient expectations are part of the calculus. They \"are demanding more privacy and more dignity,\" said Michael Forbes, a product designer at the Henry Ford Innovation Institute. When the institute tested his gown design, Forbes said, patient-satisfaction scores noticeably increased in a few days. The new gown \"was emblematic...of an attitude that was conveyed to me at the hospital -- that they cared about me as a whole human being, not just the part they were operating on,\" said Dale Milford, who received a liver transplant during the time the redesign was being tested. \"That was the subtext of that whole thing, was that they were caring about me as a person and what it meant for me to be comfortable.\" But replacing the traditional design is no easy task. What patients wear needs to be comfortable yet allow health professionals proper access during exams, meaning it must open and close easily. The gowns also need to be easily mass-manufactured, as well as efficiently laundered and reused. New designs, though, can be expensive. After Valley Hospital of Ridgewood, N.J., switched to pajamas and gowns that provide extra coverage, costs went up $70,000 per year, said Leonard Guglielmo, the facility's chief supply chain officer, because the new garments cost more to buy and maintain. Beyond cost, more ingrained cultural expectations might also play a role in what hospitals think patients should wear, said Todd Lee, an assistant professor of medicine at McGill University, who co-authored a 2014 study in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, examining whether gowns were important and whether patients might be fine wearing their own or hospital-provided pants, instead of or along with gowns. Often, doctors reported that pants or undergarments beneath gowns would have been okay, but patients said they were never given those options. Traditional gowns make it easier to examine patients quickly, and several doctors Lee spoke to seemed shocked at the idea that patients might wear garments other than the open-backed gown during their stay. But the most common challenge isn't necessarily doctor expectations or costs. It's navigating hospital bureaucracies, said Dusty Eber, president of the California-based company PatientStyle, which designs and sells alternative gowns. In his company's experience, hospital decisions are often made by committees, not individuals. \"There's a lot of bureaucratic runaround,\" Eber said.

However, the rise of the young adult heroine has prompted a backlash on Twitter, as more people compare the fictional portrayals with the mediocrity of their own lives. Teenagers have taken to the social media site to hilariously voice their frustrations between the fantastical lives in the pages of books and in films, and reality using the hashtag #realisticYA. The Hunger Games book (left), the main character, Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence in the film - pictured right) deals with exciting scenarios but never from any teenage ailments such as acne or braces . Twitter user, Adrienne Long, makes a reference to the fact that many YA heroines have their lives turned upside-down, but they are always prepared. Real life would perhaps be very different . Many of the tweets look at similar dystopian situations to those in the novels, but the Twitter users describe their own realistic reactions, or what would really be probable. Comparing real life to Katniss Everdeen's role in The Hunger Games, Adrienne Long tweets: 'Girl finds out she has impossible destiny to fulfill. Fails miserably having never spent a day preparing for it #realisticYA.' Some funny tweets simply address that at a time when many teenagers are going through the awkward stages of puberty, the YA protagonists are completely free from any awkward ailments. Joanna Macgregor tweeted: 'I met this new guy at school. He's really freaking cute but he has, like, zits, and I have, y'know, a muffin-top.' Young adults tell it like is is on Twitter under the hashtag #realistic YA . One teen addresses that unlike her perfect YA contemporaries, she suffers from  adolescent ailments . Another girl's tweet refers to Twilight, where the main character has to choose from multiple love-interests . Some look at dangerous scenarios and what would be likely to happen. Rather than escaping every situation unscathed, the Twitter users take a wry and straight-forward approach to the situation. Referring to the Twilight novel, one writer refers to Bella's choice between her multiple love-interests Jacob and Edward. Danielle Welling writes: 'Girl has no problem choosing between two equally hot boys in love with her. Because no hot boys love her. #realisticYA.' Other tweets look at young teens in a realistic manner, calling them '100% human' rather than 'mysterious and broody', and others look at realistic situations that arise with teen romances. Another tweet describes being too busy to be the 'chosen one' - referring to the character Beatrice Prior in Divergent. Preeti Chhibber writes: 'Girl is Chosen One but actually has 250hrs of community service, college apps, SATs and resume building so she can't but thx #realisticYA.' Not the chosen one? In the book Divergent (left), Beatrice Prior, who is played by Shailene Woodley in the film (pictured right with actor Theo James) is the 'chosen' one and leads a rebellion against the corrupt goverment . One user points out that many would not have the time to simply drop their lives to become the 'Chosen One' The hashtag on Twitter sees users comparing the reality of their own lives to young adult heroines . This #realisticYA looks at the fact that real teenage scenarios can mean that sometimes love is unrequited . If Harry Potter had never gone to Hogwarts, JK Rowling may have had five or six less books to write . Some of the tweets are hilarious because if the character in question did what the tweet suggests, much of the action in the novels would have never happened. Linda Newbery tweets: 'Boy thinks about running away, but changes mind when he realises that life at home is just too comfortable.' Many can imagine what the Harry Potter books would have been like if Harry never went to wizard school, Hogwarts. How young adults would really react to situations in novels revealed on Twitter . Another Twitter user users the hashtag to voice her concern that romantic leads have to be 'broody' or a 'jerk' Another girl writes about the realistic possibility that teenagers might be too frightened to confront their romantic interests . Hundreds of Twitter users have taken part in the hashtag . Others have written funny commentaries about how swiftly the heroine's life changes - and how a normal teenager, put in the same scenario, would be highly unprepared and may miss the opportunity. Another tweet explores the fact that on several occasions in YA novels, the protagonist may meet a mysterious, handsome stranger who aids her, but unlike normal teens is never overwhelmed or nervous.

Jamal Kiyemba, 36, was detained in the Ugandan capital Kampala in connection with the death of Joan Kagezi, who was killed in front of her children days before a major trial against Islamist terror network Al-Shabaab. Kiyemba, a former pharmacy student at a university in Leicester, who grew up in London, was held at Guantanamo Bay for four years and awarded the huge payout after being released. Arrested: Ex-Guantanamo Bay prisoner Jamal Kiyemba, 36 was detained in\u00a0Kampala over the brutal murder of top female prosecutor Joan Kagezi . The 36-year-old is one of 16 former Guantanamo prisoners awarded a \u00a320million payout from the British taxpayer over claims of false imprisonment and human rights abuse. His case was championed by Muslim human rights group CAGE, whose director infamously branded ISIS executioner Mohammed 'Jihadi John' Emwazi an 'extremely gentle, kind, beautiful young man'. He was born in Uganda as Anthony Kiyemba, but converted to Islam aged 20, changing his name to Jamal Abdullah. When the family arrived in Britain following the death of his father in 1993, Kiyemba, then 14, was granted indefinite leave to remain, but never applied for British citizenship. Kiyemba was arrested near Peshawar in Pakistan in March 2002, after allegedly trying to enter Afghanistan in the company of 'a probable al-Qaeda operative, a suspected al-Qaeda operative and a low-level jihadist', U.S. military files reveal. Compensated: Kiyemba was awarded \u00a31million from the British government over claims he had been tortured by U.S. intelligence and interrogated by the MI5 at Guantanamo which had violated his human rights . Kiyemba, however, claims he had gone to Pakistan to study Arabic and the Koran because the country was 'very cheap'. Following his 2006 release, he claimed he had only admitted to terrorist activities under torture by American intelligence officers and that he had been interrogated by MI5. He was held at Guantanamo Bay for four years but as he was not a British citizen, he was not entitled to representation by the Foreign Office nor, on his release, to automatic rights to return to his family. Kiyemba, whose mother, four brothers and sister all live in Britain, was instead deported to Uganda, but made several attempts to be allowed back into the UK. 'I may not be British according to some bit of paper but in reality I am a Brit and always will be,' he said in an interview following his release. 'My doctor, my local mosque, my teens, my education, employment, friends, taxes, home and above all else my family - it is all in Britain.' Support: Kiyemba's compensation claims were championed by human rights charity CAGE, whose research director, Asim Qureshi, pictured, famously branded ISIS executioner Jihadi John a 'kind, beautiful' man . Kiyemba was arrested alongside three others in a suburb to Kampala on Tuesday as a result of an operation aided by U.S. officials, Ugandan police spokesman Fred Enanga said. Jamal Kyiemba is one of 16 former Guantanamo Bay detainees paid compensation by the British Government over claims of human rights abuse. A total of \u00a320million has been awarded to former prisoners in an out-of-court settlement after they made allegations against British intelligence, the Sun reports. Others include Shaker Aamer, 48, who still remains in Guantanamo after 13 years without charge or trial, despite being cleared for release twice. Once he is released Mr Aamer, from south London, should be entitled to \u00a31million. Ms Kagezi had been a prosecutor in the ongoing trial of 12 suspects accused of being involved in the July 2010 bombings in which 76 people were killed while watching the World Cup final on TV. Somali Islamic extremist group al-Shabaab, who were behind the brutal massacre of nearly 150 students at a Kenyan university this month, claimed responsibility for the attack. Earlier this year, Ms Kagezi had been appointed Head of the International Crimes Division, at the rank of Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions. Kagezi was shot twice by gunmen after she left her car \u2014 in which she was traveling with two of her children on the way home from work \u2014 to buy groceries in a Kampala suburb. After shooting her in the head and neck, the gunmen fled on a motorcycle, according to police. Ugandan police say there is not yet conclusive evidence tying Kiyemba to the murder of Ms Kagezi, but that detectives were questioning him about any possible role and about other offenses.

That's in part because Easter is genuinely about how religious impulses, and patterns, can operate in ways that affect our lives. Nevertheless, I'm often surprised by how little people, even those supposedly within the Christian tradition, actually know about what is called Holy Week and its culmination on Easter Sunday.   At a time when our culture is roiled by questions of identity and ethics (and tolerance) that have profound religious implications, it's worth pausing to explore this crucial holiday -- and the awareness of the human condition, in all its sadness and glory, that it engenders. After all, Holy Week calls mostly to those who incline their minds and hearts in its direction with seriousness of intent.  Still, the fuss must puzzle those looking on, wondering what it all means.  Why do Christians make so much of this springtime week, and make so much of Easter weekend? There is a phrase that many never come across, even among Christians:  Easter Triduum.  This refers to the three days of Easter that begin with Good Friday, proceed through Holy Saturday, and conclude with Easter Sunday.  It's definitely a progression, although the word itself -- triduum -- can refer to any three days of prayer. Easter Triduum has a kind of major prologue in Maundy Thursday, the day when, by tradition, Jesus celebrated the Last Supper with his disciples in the upper room in Jerusalem on the night before he was crucified.  The idea of Holy Communion begins with this meal, which was a Passover meal. Jesus, of course, was Jewish, as were all his disciples.  He was never trying to erase Judaism and found a new religion.  His work involved modifying and extending Judaism in fresh ways. On Maundy Thursday, Christians sometimes practice the washing of feet, recalling that Jesus washed the very dusty feet of his disciples at the Last Supper as a way of demonstrating profound humility -- showing that he was himself a servant -- and modeling a kind of ideal behavior. Good Friday isn't, in fact, so good.  It's the day of the crucifixion, when Jesus was scourged and beaten, forced to carry his cross to Golgotha, the \"place of the skull,\" and nailed to the cross itself for what must have been an agonizing death.  The actual scene of the Crucifixion varies from gospel to gospel, as do his last words, assembled into the so-called \"seven last words\" of Jesus by adding up fragments from different gospels. Some of these words are quotations, as when Jesus asked God why he has abandoned him:  This is a quote from the 22nd Psalm, which opens:  \"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\"  Good Friday is a day of death, sacrifice, displacement, fear. Holy Saturday is probably the least understood day of the Easter Triduum.  It's a passageway between the darkness of the crucifixion and the bright hope of Easter.  This day occupies an anxious space in human experience, when the certain knowledge of something dreadful isn't quite erased -- can't be erased -- simply by hope.  It's a day of depression, a day of suspension. Then comes Easter, with the aura of the resurrection.  I'm always moved by the deep symbolism of this mythic moment, when the body of Christ becomes what is called a \"glorified body.\"  This was not, as I've said elsewhere, the Great Resuscitation, although that's part of it, too.  Resurrection implies a total transformation, something beyond the physical realm. It's very important that almost nobody who encounters Jesus after the resurrection can really recognize him, know him, or understand him as the same person who was with them before he was crucified.  Easter embraces the great mystery of resurrection, with its promise of transformation -- a shift from one form to another, and a change that moves well beyond any literal understanding. The three days of Easter, the Triduum, occur only once a year on the calendar.  But the really interesting thing is that we all experience the pattern of the three days again and again.  We find ourselves emptied out in small ways, nailed to our own trees in life, embarrassed or broken by life. It was the Buddha who famously observed that life is suffering.  Good Friday embodies the Christian version of that truth.  Jesus suffered in the way all of us must suffer.  We must all die, perhaps less ignominiously but just as certainly.  Our friends and families must die.  We all experience illness, loss, sadness, a loss of confidence, darkness.  This is simply part of the human experience. We dive again and again into Holy Saturday, too -- a period of transition, when the bleakness of suffering is perhaps slightly behind us but nothing restorative seems in view.  We know well this in-between time; it's an anxious passage, with only a glimmer on the horizon of potential hope. And we've all been resurrected, again and again, perhaps in tiny ways.  This is the joy of Easter, and it's not something reserved for one day on the calendar.  It's there whenever we experience what T.S. Eliot once called the \"timeless moment,\" which can only occur -- paradoxically -- in time itself.  It's a mystical point where timelessness intersects with time. I suspect we all experience the Triduum frequently, sometimes more than once in a single day.  But the ritual enactment of these three days of the Easter season reminds all of those who practice Christianity -- and perhaps those who don't -- that we should expect to move through darkness into light. It's a pattern that describes a kind of spiritual progression.   It's good cause for celebration, too:  and one that won't easily be co-opted by secular culture.", "reference": "Jay Parini: When religious identity, ethics, tolerance are roiling the culture, it's worth looking at message of Holy Week and Easter .\nHe says ritual enactment of these three days is reminder that again and again the human condition moves through darkness into light ."}, "24": {"id": "6c1e7800fcdacc93baefbb8cf8db1d2f6b9c4803", "article": "When most think of Ford, its ubiquitous Fiesta and Focus spring to mind. But in a bid to shed its image as the home of the mundane run-around, the company has launched its very own supercar. With the first models already shipped to China, the  GT, will be unrolled across Europe next year. While Ford has refused to officially confirm its price, bosses have indicated it will run alongside the \u00a3260,000 Lamborghini Aventador. To herald its launch, the company's design team have created a stunning light sculpture which showcases how they came about creating the prototype. Ford showcased its \u00a3260,000 GT in a stunning light installation in the heart of Milan as the first models are shipped to China . The light sculpture was unveiled in the  Piazza de Fidele on Tuesday as part of Milan Design Week . Planted in Milan's Piazza de Fidele, it walked through the steps of rendering to give insight into the car's conception. In the heart of one of the world's most design-savvy cities, many were surprised to learn the piece had been produced by car designers and engineers, said bosses. '(Having an artwork) is something new for us but really it combined everything that we do everyday,' said Moray Callum, Ford's Vice President of design. 'The model making, the technology - all of that was done in house so it's just taking what we do and presenting it in a different way.' 'We, generally, are a car company that talks to car guys but we wanted to reach a wider audience. 'We've had people approaching the installation and asking \"this is Ford?!\" which is just great. 'People were shocked that we were doing this and that's what we wanted to hear.' Alongside the modern artwork, Ford has released some of the first impressions of what the GTs interior will look like. The artwork was composed by Ford designers who worked on the concept for the \u00a3260,000 GT . The interactive installation was placed in Milan's Piazza de Fidele where it remained throughout design week . With its exterior a combination of aluminium and carbon-fibre, the compact two-seater has all the hallmarks of its ultra-sleek competitors. And earmarked at around the same price as the Lamborghini Aventador, the GT is a far cry from the much-loved models which keeps the company afloat. But despite a drive towards luxury, bosses insist the company is not trying to breakaway from its most reliable consumer. 'As long as I'm around, the mum on the school run will remain important - but design is important for her too,' added Mr Callum. Speaking at Milan's Salone de Mobile - an annual showcase of the world's leading furniture and light designers - he continued: 'Generally we are a car company that talks to car guys but we want to reach a wider audience. 'Design has always been important but we're finding you need to expand your audience.' The model was showcased for the first time at the International Auto Show in Detroit earlier this year (above) The car has up-swinging doors and 600 horsepower. It was unveiled in January in Detroit to a rapturous reception . The first images of the interior of the Ford GT have been revealed after 100 of the supercars were shipped to China . While the vehicle won't reach European markets until next year, bosses say they have been 'pleased' with the reaction the car . While the GT is priced out of most's grasp, another of its most advanced vehicles could be brought to the masses, he added. Ford's version of a driverless car is in the final stages of production with just safety legislation and measure standing between it and the open road. 'We have autonomous cars that we've been working on for the past 20 years in Detroit. A lot of the technology is there for about 90 per cent of driving,' added Mr Callum. 'What we're working on now is that extra 10 per cent which will take into account whether there are road works or if there's been an accident (and it's not registered).'", "reference": "Ford unveiled its GT earlier this year to the surprise of industry experts .\nThe supercar has 600 horsepower, up-swinging doors and a rear engine .\nIts design was showcased in a light installation at Milan's Piazza de Fidele .\nIt comes as bosses say  autonomous car is '10 per cent' from complete ."}, "25": {"id": "1cb74e6229083d8a145bba37e7990c7105200671", "article": "Newly-discovered medical records have finally revealed the fate of pre-Raphaelite artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti's muse Fanny Cornforth and how she died a tragic, death penniless death. The details of where and how the West-Sussex born model and mistress of Rossetti died remained a mystery for years until her biographer recently tracked her down through hospital records. They revealed the orange-haired beauty - whose face graced many of her lover's paintings - died in the Sussex county asylum in poverty and suffering from clear symptoms of dementia. Rossetti's famous painting Aurelia 'Fazio's Mistress' (pictured) was a portrait of his muse Fanny Cornforth . Fair Rosamund, painted in 1861 (left), and 1886's Lady Lilith (right) also used Cornforth as the model . The records revealed she died at the Graylingwell Hospital on February 24, 1909, at the age of 74. At the time of her death, she was suffering from 'senile mania, confusion, weak-mindedness and an inability to sustain a rational conversation, a poor memory and sleeplessness', The Guardian reported. Born Sarah Cox in 1835, she met Rossetti in 1958 and was considered one of his 'stunners' - a reference to the women he kept in his company as lovers and models. She went on to pose for at least 60 of his artworks. Art historian Kirsty Stonell Walker used the records from Graylingwell Hospital in Chichester, now stored at the West Sussex records office, to track down her  resting site and lay flowers at her unmarked grave. Ms Stonell Walker told The Guardian: 'It is a very sad story, but the hospital was not a terrible place, it actually had a very progressive approach towards mental illness. 'She was buried with a few other people, but not exactly in a pauper's grave.' Rossetti was the son of Italian scholar Gabriele Pasquale Giuseppe Rossetti and his wife Frances Polidori. He was born in London in 1828 and is known for his painting, illustrating, translating and poetry. He founded the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in 1848 with contemporaries William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais. His most famous paintings include Beata Beatrix, The Girlhood of Mary Virgin, How They Met Themselves. Dante Gabriel Rossetti was one of the most well-known founding members of the Pre-Raphelites group . The Pre-Raphelites were a group of English artists who formed a 'brotherhood' in 1848, dedicated to creating work that rejected the mannered approach adopted by Raphael and other Renaissance painters. Believing Raphael, Michelangelo and Leonardo had proven a corrupting influence on art, they wanted to return to the intense colour and detailed compositions that characterised 15th century Italian art. Founded by William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, the trio later welcomed Rossetti's brother, William, James Collinson, Frederic George Stephens and Thomas Woolner to their circle.", "reference": "Details of the death of Dante Gabriel Rossetti's muse finally unmasked .\nBiographer\u00a0Kirsty Stonell Walker located her grave using medical records .\nThey revealed she died penniless, suffering from dementia in an asylum .\nShe was the muse and model for some of Rossetti's best-known works ."}, "26": {"id": "3a37aa1d9f97c3025078534e2d1884ee706d02c2", "article": "Yaya Toure will not be forced out of Manchester City, but the club are set to make the midfielder available this summer. Sportsmail\u00a0revealed earlier this week that the Barclays Premier League champions will listen to offers for the Ivorian as they look to reshape their squad after a disappointing season. But Toure will fight for his City career this summer despite the club pondering his future. Yaya Toure will not be forced out of Manchester City, but the club are set to make him available this summer . Sportsmail revealed earlier this week that the  Premier League champions will listen to offers for the Ivorian . He is said to be content with life at the Etihad Stadium despite the difficulties and is in no rush to leave. The Ivorian has played a major role during City's recent trophy-laden period, helping the club to two Premier League titles, an FA Cup and League Cup since joining from Barcelona in 2010. And the powerhouse midfielder still believes he can have a major impact for City in the future and remains fully committed to the cause. Another stumbling block towards a potential move is the four-time African Player of the Year winner's wages. Inter Milan, managed by Roberto Mancini, are interested but given his huge wages there are some doubts . Toure has more than two years left on his current \u00a3220,000-a-week deal and is unlikely to move for anything less. A number of clubs, such as Inter Milan, are interested in the 31-year-old, but given his huge salary there must be doubts over whether they would be able to afford it. Inter are prepared to offer Toure a five-year deal to compensate for the pay-cut he would be required to take if he moved to Italy \u2014 although, it remains to be seen whether he'd agree to such a compromise. There have been preliminary talks about a contract extension for Toure at City \u2014 which included the possibility of an ambassadorial role when he hangs up his boots. But it seems the club are now happy for him to leave. City, meanwhile, will resist any attempt by Valencia to pull out of a \u00a324million deal for Alvaro Negredo to fund a move for Radamel Falcao, currently on loan at Manchester United. City will resist any attempt by Valencia to pull out of a \u00a324million deal for Alvaro Negredo this summer . Negredo joined Valencia on loan last summer and the agreement included a clause involving a permanent move to the Mestalla. Reports in Spain  suggested that Valencia are having second thoughts about keeping Negredo next season, but City are adamant that the deal will go through as planned. The 29-year-old striker scored 23 goals in his first season at the Etihad following a \u00a320.6m move from Sevilla, but he has only found the net five times for Valencia. When he scored in Monday\u2019s 3-0 win over Levante, the Spain striker refused to celebrate, fuelling speculation over his future at the club. Negredo joined Valencia on loan last summer but reports in Spain say they are looking at Radamel Falcao . Victory kept Valencia in fourth place in La Liga and on course to qualify for the Champions League, but financial problems mean they are already struggling to hold onto key players like defender Nicolas Otamendi. It has, however, not stopped Valencia being linked with a summer move for Falcao, who is set to leave United at the end of his season-long loan from Monaco. Falcao\u2019s agent Jorge Mendes has been acting as an advisor to Valencia owner Peter Lim and offloading Negredo is seen as one way of affording the Colombia star.

It emerged on Thursday that the former England captain has already held talks with new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison and is in pole position to become the new director of cricket ahead of Andrew Strauss and Alec Stewart. Yet Vaughan will demand almost unprecedented responsibility if he is to head up the revolution that Harrison and chairman-elect Colin Graves have begun with Wednesday\u2019s sacking of Downton as managing director. Clearly, if the ECB are going to land the man who appears to be their first choice then they will have to make him a supremo with powers not seen since Ray Illingworth\u2019s controversial reign in the early 1990s. Michael Vaughan has emerged as the favourite for the newly created role of director of England cricket . Vaughan was understood to be talking to the ECB about the role on Thursday after emerging as the No1 choice . The exact terms of the new position were discussed at Thursday\u2019s meeting of the ECB management board but if the director is to be Vaughan then he will command overall responsibility for coaching and selection. Vaughan is one of the busiest men in cricket, earning close to \u00a31million a year through his various media roles with the BBC, Sky, Channel 5 and the Daily Telegraph and his involvement with sponsors and the ISM management group. If he is to give up all of that \u2014 and it would be a clear conflict of interests if he continues his involvement in an agency that represents Stuart Broad, Joe Root and Jos Buttler \u2014 then he will want a massive salary and ultimate control of the team. On the day that both Strauss and Stewart threw their hats into the ring for the new job, one source told Sportsmail that Vaughan\u2019s appointment was already a done deal and that he could even be unveiled before Monday\u2019s first Test in the West Indies. Alec Stewart, who is also in the frame, stands at the KIA Oval ahead of a Surrey team photo shoot on Thursday . Vaughan and Stewart both work in the media as cricket analysts and commentators . Ultimately the decision will be taken by Harrison and particularly Graves, who is close to Vaughan and is clearly keen to implement huge and rapid change in the national team as he did at Yorkshire. The implications of the return to the England set-up of the 2005 Ashes-winning captain would be significant for the leading figures in the domestic game. If Vaughan becomes supremo then there may not even be the need for a head coach and, if the position does remain, it is impossible to envisage Peter Moores surviving even if England win their Test series against West Indies. Vaughan has been a constant critic of the coach in his second coming, saying he would be better off working with young players. There is no doubt that Graves \u2014 and Vaughan \u2014 would love Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie to succeed Moores, but convincing the Australian to throw in his lot with England will be challenging. Gillespie is happy at Headingley and with his Big Bash role with Adelaide. Vaughan, who has been an outspoken pundit, would have to build some bridges were he to take the role. Alastair Cook has often been a target of Vaughan\u2019s sometimes inconsistent criticisms and would be on borrowed time as England captain under him unless he scores big runs and wins lots of Test matches quickly. Vaughan was particularly critical of Jonathan Trott for his departure from last year's Ashes tour of Australia . Also, Vaughan would have to provide an explanation to Jonathan Trott for his strongly-worded column on his departure from the last Ashes tour with what was eventually diagnosed as \u2018situational anxiety.\u2019 Vaughan said he felt \u2018conned\u2019 by Trott, who he accused of \u2018doing a runner\u2019 from Australia. One man who would greet Vaughan\u2019s succession more warmly than most would undoubtedly be Kevin Pietersen, who would be handed a clear route back into the England team by the appointment of the captain he got on best with. If Pietersen scores heavily for Surrey and Vaughan is at the helm of the England team then a comeback that appeared impossible just a few months ago after the publication of his bitter autobiography really would be on. There is no doubt that if the job description had remained the same to that of Downton\u2019s then Strauss, who said  that he would be interested in the job, would be the outstanding candidate. Andrew Strauss is another former England captain who is being considered for the role . Paul Downton lost his job as the England and Wales Cricket Board's managing director of cricket . Strauss is widely respected by the England team and management but would be far more comfortable in a suit with distance between him and the players rather than in a tracksuit at the heart of the dressing room. The apparent moving of the goalposts, with the business side of Downton\u2019s role now disappearing, would seem to favour Vaughan over Strauss. The third man on the shortlist, Stewart, remains the outsider of the trio. These are clearly seismic times for English cricket with Graves and Harrison apparently dismantling everything created by ex-chairman Giles Clarke, who was  confirmed in a new role as ECB president. The bottom line is, with national selector James Whitaker in danger of becoming the next to follow Downton out of the door, the whole senior structure of the England team could change before this year\u2019s Ashes. If the dominoes keep crashing down, Vaughan could be at the helm of an England team this summer with Gillespie as his coach, Joe Root as captain and Pietersen back in the team. And that, following 15 months of turmoil since the England team unravelled so dramatically by losing the Ashes 5-0, would be truly remarkable.

She turned to Dr Zhai after losing a baby she conceived via IVF treatment on the NHS. Jane Parker had her son Rupert in 2009 when she was 41 after having treatment at Dr Zhai's clinic . She said: 'I got pregnant and I carried through for 11 weeks but then I miscarried a month ago. 'I think about it every day but you have to move on so that's why I'm here. You have to take positive steps and not think about what is lost.' May has an initial consultation with\u00a0Dr Zhai which costs \u00a3250 for an hour. During the assessment, Dr Zhai quizzes her on her lifestyle and observes that she doesn't appear to be in the best health because of the appearance of her tongue and her pale complexion. But she tells her she had potential and she's confident she will conceive. May pays \u00a3300 a month for tea made from Chinese herbs. Further check-ups with Dr Zhai will cost her \u00a3130, while three sessions of acupuncture at the clinic cost \u00a3350. After a period taking the Chinese herbal tea, she is then prescribed a mixture of Chinese herbs in a pill form which must be taken 24 times a day (12 in the morning and 12 in the evening) for two weeks, costing around \u00a3150. The BBC documentary catches up with May months on from her first appointment with Dr Zhai and while she still hasn't become pregnant, she remains hopeful. She said: 'I've got the clinic on my side, this can happen. It doesn't bother me that I'm not pregnant yet. At my last consultation, Dr Zhai said I'm not ready yet, I need to fix what's inside.' But May adds that if she still doesn't fall pregnant, she will ditch the alternative therapies in favour of IVF on the NHS again. Dr Zhai said acupuncture aids fertility because it 'promotes your body's natural healing response and stimulates natural energy flow' In her book, How To Get Pregnant, Dr Zhai said her methods work for those who can't be helped by IVF. She writes: 'I believe that our success rate is high because most patients who have trouble conceiving are not suffering from mechanical problems such as blocked fallopian tubes (these can be fixed by surgery or bypassed using IVF). Goji berries are one of the ingredients that may be found in Dr Zhai's fertility boosting vitamins . 'The most common causes of IVF failure are poor sperm production, poor quality eggs, malfunction of the ovaries or the blood supply with the abdomen not being healthy enough. 'Couples who find it difficult to conceive have problems that can often be helped by kick-starting the reproductive system, improving sperm quality and quantity and improving the menstrual cycle.' She said the herbal medicine, combined with a change to a healthy diet and light exercise, can work because: 'Herbal medicine has powerful healing properties which work on the internal organs and the reproductive system. 'It aims to clear obstruction, rectifies the balance between yin and yang in the organs and helps to restore normal bodily functions.' She also claimed: 'Most importantly, herbs have proved capable of reducing chromosomal abnormality in male sperm and female eggs so improving quality of both.' When it comes to another of her recommended treatments - acupuncture - she writes on her website: 'Acupuncture is believed to work by promoting your body's natural healing response and stimulating and balancing natural energy flow (known as Qi or chi). The BBC documentary Inside Harley Street also looks at other alternative therapies on offer for various ailments. 'Leech therapist' Maryam Rahbari, pictured, says the worms can work wonders for the health . 'Practitioners are trained to understand that the network of the energy pathway (known as meridians) that connect the organs of the body. 'When one of these pathways becomes blocked or malfunctions, problems such as pain, illness or disease may result. 'By stimulating the specific acupuncture points, TCM [traditional Chinese medicine] practitioners are trained to clear blockages in the body's meridian system, with the aim of restoring balance in the body.' Acupuncture involves inserting tiny needles into the skin and is an ancient Chinese treatment that is being embraced more widely in the west for problems such as stress and back pain. It has not yet been  proven to help women conceive but it is thought to increase the chances - possibly because it makes a woman more relaxed. As well as looking at alternative therapies for infertility on Harley Street, tonight's documentary also looks at the other unusual treatments - such as applying leeches to the skin to relieve pain - that people are turning to when traditional western medicine hasn't helped them.

But pace attack colleague Chris Jordan believes the Anderson family celebration party is 'just around the corner' as West Indies fell to 155 for four in response to England's first-innings total of 399. Anderson, watched by his parents, wife, two daughters and agent and needing four wickets to overtake the great Sir Ian Botham's haul of 383, claimed only one early victim in West Indies opener Devon Smith in his 13 overs, which went for 24 runs and eight maidens. Jimmy Anderson moved to within two wickets of Sir Ian Botham's record of 383 Test wickets . Anderson could only take the one wicket on day two of the first Test in Antigua . But even the England back-room staff were surprised that Anderson bowled just four overs in the last session of play with team-mates Jordan, Stuart Broad and James Tredwell sharing the other wickets to fall. It could have been better but a Ben Stokes wicket was ruled a no ball. Jordan took a stunning slip catch off Tredwell to dismiss West Indies vice-captain Kraigg Brathwaite, who claimed after play that he thought Anderson ' looked tired'. But Jordan said: 'Jimmy got us off and running with the first wicket and the rest of us tried to back that up, which I thought we did pretty well. If he keeps doing that and bowling the way he does those wickets are just around the corner. Chris Jordan jumps for joy after taking the wicket of Darren Bravo on the second afternoon . Jordan appeals for an lbw against West Indian batsman Kraigg Brathwaite, but it was unsuccessful . 'The stat is obviously there but I don't think Jimmy or any of us are going about our cricket or thinking about things differently. 'We're just trying to group balls as a bowling unit and create pressure. 'As a group we try and win every session, so we'll come back as hard as we can to break this partnership then make inroads into the tail.' Ironically, No 11 Anderson and Jordan were the pick of the lower-order England batsman in a last-wicket partnership of 38 as the West Indies bowling attack, inspired by a talk from bowling coach Sir Curtly Ambrose, captured the last five wickets for 58. West Indies opener Brathwaite did a good job of seeing off Anderson in a challenging first spell and though he eventually fell for 39, he enjoyed the test. Jordan later took a stunning catch at first slip off Tredwell's bowling to dismiss Brathwaite . 'Obviously when Anderson started with the new ball it was moving a lot, so facing him then was a little more challenging. 'But obviously he bowled a couple of overs before lunch as well so I don't know if maybe he was a little bit tired. 'It was a good challenge facing him when the ball is swinging both ways. The key is to keep as still as possible.' Brathwaite's knock would probably have lasted longer had anyone other than the athletic Jordan been stationed at slip, where he claimed a superb one-handed catch inches off the ground. Jordan is, of course, Barbados born - a fact not lost on Brathwaite. 'It was CJ who caught me, a fella from here, so it was quite unlucky.' About his catch, Jordan said: ' It was a reaction one but it rivals my best at this level.'", "reference": "Jimmy Anderson claimed his 381st Test wicket on Tuesday in Antigua .\nThe 32-year-old dismissed Devon Smith for 10 on day two of first Test .\nAnderson is still two wickets behind Sir Ian Botham's record of 383 .\nChris Jordan says that the record is 'just around the corner'"}, "32": {"id": "5d59fa7102b98c71abd058669dcd77ed3ca9ab5b", "article": "A mother-of-two lost more than ten stone after she became concerned that her size was causing her to look like a man. Kim Callaghan, 39, piled on the pounds after the birth of her two children, reaching a worrying  20st 3lb. However, the determined slimmer has now shrunk down to a slender 9st 10lb after taking up exercise and swapping starchy meals for smaller portions. Kim Callaghan became so worried that her weight was causing her to look like a man that she went on a dramatic diet that saw her lose half of her body weight . Kim's weight loss saw her drop an incredible ten dress sizes to slim down to a slinky size eight. Before she slimmed down Kim's wardrobe was limited to size 28 figure-hiding garments, and she was afraid she was losing her femininity. Kim who lives in Ardee, County Louth, Ireland, says she turned to masculine clothing as a way of hiding her shape. 'I only wore baggy trousers and flappy shirts when I was fat - I was trying to cover up my body because I was embarrassed. I stopped looking like a woman. 'Now I've slimmed down and I feel confident enough to wear dresses again. I feel healthy and very feminine.' Kim married her husband Sean Callaghan, 41, in 1999. After the pair got married they splashed out on a double deep-fat fryer. Kim piled on the pounds after giving birth to her two children, as she became heavier she worried that her husband Sean would not see her as the 'sexy' woman he married . Before her weight loss Kim was limited to a wardrobe of size 28 clothing she is now a slinky size 10 . The housewife's diet consisted mainly of convenience foods like chicken kiev, deep-fried chicken, potato croquettes and burgers. She said: 'We loved pizza, chips and chicken kievs. The deep fat fryer was my favourite thing in the house.' Soon after Kim gave birth to her children Owen, now 14, and Shannon, 13, and her weight gain accelerated. Eventually she tipped the scales at 20st 3lb and says that she found it increasingly difficult to find clothes to suit her. The turning point came for Kim when she struggled to keep up with her children she now takes part in regular exercise including cycling around her local area . Kim joined Slimming World in secret and lost a stone in her first three weeks . 'I tried to take pride in my appearance, but at that size it was impossible to find anything flattering, I ordered all my clothes from catalogues. 'Before long I had a wardrobe which could have been owned by a man. I had a signature cropped hairstyle and honestly looked nothing like a woman. I was worried that the the sexy, curvy bride which Sean had married had disappeared forever.' The turning point came for Kim when she was out with her children on St Patrick's Day in 2011. She had to stop and rest after struggling to keep up. She said: 'I was trying to follow the kids up a hill near our home. I was hot and sweaty and I had to stop to catch my breath. 'My weight was getting in the way of my life with my kids - I knew it was time to change. 'When I got home that night I found a Slimming World leaflet had been posted through my door. I thought it was a sign.' Kim started attending her local Slimming World classes in secret and was initially embarrassed to admit she was trying to lose weight. She said: 'It took all my courage to go to the meetings - I was convinced everyone would judge me. Kim feels far more feminine now that she is not limited to catalogue clothing . 'Three weeks later I'd shed a stone and I celebrated by telling my husband and the kids. They were all very supportive and amazed at what I had done.' In a bid to make a dramatic change she swapped greasy fried foods for healthy meals cooked from scratch. Kim even threw out her double deep-fat-fryer. The devoted slimmer also started running and cycling - and the pounds started to fall off. Soon she had slimmed down to the slinky 9st 10lb she is today and ditched her baggy unflattering clothes for good. She said: 'I love being able to go into shops and have everything fit me. I don't need to order from catalogues any more. 'I feel fantastic and I look great. I have a new life now.' Breakfast: Nothing . Lunch: Fry-up with four slices of buttered bread .

Health experts have warned that being socially isolated can be as harmful as smoking 15 cigarettes a day, leading to an increased risk of problems such as dementia and high blood pressure. Now campaigners say that local councils should draw up maps of the places where pensioners and others are most likely to suffer from social isolation. Map: This 'loneliness map' was drawn up by Essex County Council showing the areas where residents are most vulnerable to becoming socially isolated . Two county councils, Essex and Gloucestershire, have already implemented the maps, which allow them to target 'danger zones' of loneliness. A new report from the University of Kent and the Campaign to End Loneliness recommends the maps as a way of treating the problem across the country. In Gloucestershire, council bosses compiled the maps by studying statistics on a range of public health factors which are often linked to lonely people. They looked for areas with large numbers of over-65s, people living alone, people suffering from mental illness, households with no car and people on a low income. Danger: Being lonely can lead to health problems including dementia (picture posed by model) The council also surveyed residents to identify those who rarely speak to their neighbours, are unsatisfied with their social life and say they don't have someone to talk to. They then combined all those factors to map the districts where people are most likely to be suffering from loneliness, with the most vulnerable areas marked in red. A spokesman for the council said: 'Targeting local people who need our help the most is a priority for us in Gloucestershire and we are always looking at new ways to reach them. 'The map we've adapted from a model by Essex County Council means that we can work out how many people could be lonely and where those people need us most.' The Campaign to End Loneliness has now called on other councils to copy the maps and draw up their own versions for their local area. The campaign's director Laura Alcock-Ferguson said: 'Finding people who are experiencing loneliness can be challenging, as they are often also some of the most hidden people in our communities. 'However, it is encouraging that, across the country, there are excellent examples of councils that are employing different strategies to identify residents most at risk of loneliness. 'If local councils and services do not act now to find the people experiencing severe loneliness, we are likely to see the consequences in our hospitals and social care services.' The report identifies a number of other risk factors that might make people more likely to suffer from chronic loneliness. People from ethnic minorities, those recently bereaved or forced to care for their loved ones and childless pensioners are particularly susceptible.", "reference": "Local councils are urged to draw up maps of the residents who are at risk .\nEssex and Gloucestershire have already made 'loneliness maps'\nExperts warn that being lonely can lead to serious health problems ."}, "34": {"id": "4484750d5a5298f190f17cdadc2720b9729efec1", "article": "An Arizona woman has pleaded guilty to hitting her husband with their SUV because he didn't vote in the 2012 presidential election.

They reveal the country's rapid progress in constructing the runway on the contested Fiery Cross Reef which the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan all claim. China's building activity in the Spratly Islands has infuriated neighbouring countries and the United States whose leadership accused the country of bullying others with its 'military muscle'. Images reveal Fiery Cross Reef virtually untouched by man-made structures in March 2014 but by March this year, it had been transformed into an artificial island which could be used for military operations. They follow equally disturbing photographs released earlier this month showing a flotilla of Chinese vessels dredging sand onto another artificially-built island on the nearby Mischief Reef. Construction: Newly released satellite images reveal that China has built a runway (pictured) - which could be used for military operations - in a dispute region in the South China Sea . Disputed: China has built the airstrip (pictured) on Fiery Cross Reef in the Spratly Islands without consulting the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan who all claim the region . Territory: The area near the Spratly Islands (pictured) where China is constructing artificial islands is claimed by many other countries in the region . Serene: Satellite images from August 2014 (pictured) show Fiery Cross Reef as a virtually untouched and beautiful natural sea-structure . Controversial: Whereas just seven months later in March this year, dredging ships can clearly be seen around the artificial island which has virtually destroyed the reef . The worrying photographs were revealed by security analysts Jane's Defense Weekly who claim building work in the nearby Subu Reef could create space for yet another 3,000m airstrip. And the same report suggested China was also working to extend a runway of that length in the Paracel Islands further north which is seen as a vital shipping route. More than \u00a33.3trillion worth of trade passes through the potentially energy-rich section of the South China Sea every year. The United States' military commander for Asia has said China could eventually deploy radar and missile systems on the outposts it is building in the region, which would give it the power to enforce an exclusion zone. The images showed a paved section of runway 505m by 53m on the northeastern side of the reef which China began turning into an island with extensive dredging last year. China's ambassador to the United States has said it was 'natural' that his country's reclamation work would include military defence facilities. Cui Tiankai said there 'should be no illusion that anyone could... repeatedly violate China's sovereignty without consequences'. Its actions in the South China Sea have been described as 'aggressive' by Senator John McCain, chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee. Show of strength: Other satellite images released earlier this month showed a flotilla of Chinese vessels dredging sand onto another artificially-built islands on Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands (pictured) Force: Following their release, U.S. President Barack Obama accused China of using its military might to reclaim the contested territory in the South China Sea . He urged President Obama's administration  to move more military resources into the economically important Asian region - and boost cooperation with Asian countries worried by China. McCain claims Washington has a lot of work ahead to maintain its military advantage in the Asia-Pacific. He added: 'When any nation fills in 600 acres of land and builds runways and most likely is putting in other kinds of military capabilities in what is international waters, it is clearly a threat to where the world's economy is going, has gone, and will remain for the foreseeable future.' A U.S. State Department spokesperson said the scale of China's land reclamation and construction is fueling concerns in the region that China intends to militarise its outposts. They said: 'We do not believe that large-scale land reclamation with the intent to militarize outposts on disputed land features is consistent with the region's desire for peace and stability.' Japan's Vice Foreign Minister Akitaka Saiki said China had a duty to address regional concerns And his Korean counterpart Cho Tae-yong stressed the importance of stability in the South China Sea for trading nations like his. China's leadership has hit back at U.S. President Barack Obama who last week condemned the country for constructing an artificial island on Mischief Reef in another section the disputed South China Sea. Obama claimed Beijing was 'using its sheer size and muscle to force countries into subordinate positions' amid reports of controversial land reclamation efforts in the Spratly Islands. Worrying: A U.S. State Department spokesperson said the scale of China's land reclamation in the South China Sea (pictured) is fueling concerns in the region that China intends to militarise its outposts .

But a furious Chinese leadership hit back by claiming that Washington which possesses - and wields - the greatest military muscle. Only hours before Obama's comments, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying added that it has 'indisputable rights' to the Spratly Islands and it was 'protecting its nation's sovereignty', according to the BBC. She said the construction was to serve troops protecting the area, civilian activity such as search and rescue operations, scientific research and commercial fishing. Before-and-after images from the area show aircraft runways appearing from jungle, solid masses where there was once coral and man-made harbours replacing natural reefs. The country claims the work is necessary to safeguard its sovereignty which it asserts over most of the South China sea. But the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan all have overlapping claims to the region. The dispute centres around hundreds of tiny shoals, reefs and islets in the South China Sea known as the Spratlys and the Paracels. Several south Asian countries stake claim to the territory, though China tries to control the largest portion of the archipelago. Beijing has claimed its right to the collection of land masses is 2,000 years old which, they say, includes the islands in Chinese history. Taiwan supports its claim, and has its own airfield on the island of Taiping. Vietnamese officials say their government has ruled over the land since the 17th century whilst the Philippines, the closest geographically, says the islands belong to them. In 1974, Chinese forces seized the Paracels from Vietnam, killing 70 troops. There were further clashes between the two countries in 1988, with 60 Vietnamese soldiers killed. In 2012 China and the Philippines were embroiled in a lengthy maritime standoff over a Scarborough Shoal. The\u00a0Filipino military employed its largest warship for the dispute over the stretch of water which they call Panatag. Upon boarding a Chinese military vessel for inspection, officials claimed they found live sharks, clams and illegal reef. Later, Vietnamese border agencies refused to stamp passports asserting Chinese sovereignty over a handful of the islands and in January it was claimed China would be taken to a UN tribunal to challenge its stake.", "reference": "Reveals a massive construction effort on Fiery Cross Reef in Spratly Islands .\nThe region is claimed by Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan .\nChina could use runway to carry out military operations, experts have said .\nFollows other images of Chinese construction in disputed South China Sea ."}, "36": {"id": "096e418a953af86df0d1560bec95bc7bfee2e34b", "article": "Porto's defence was not the only thing to be ripped apart at the Allianz Arena on Tuesday night as a jubilant Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola was left with a hole in his trousers.

But the gas station owner never made it on a flight back to his home Hayward, California. Family members have identified him as a victim killed in mortar strike last week in the southern Yemeni city of Aden. He is believed to be the first U.S. citizen killed in the current violence in Yemen. Early Tuesday evening, the 45-year-old al-Labani was on his way back from mosque prayers when he was hit in the back by shrapnel from a mortar shell, his family said. He died minutes later. Violence quickly escalated in Yemen soon afer al-Labani arrived in February. \"When he got (to Aden), after a few weeks he noticed things were starting to get bad and then the (U.S.) Embassy closed,\" his cousin Mohammed Alazzani told CNN. For the past three weeks, al-Labani had told family members he was concerned about not being able to evacuate as the situation deteriorated in the country, according to his cousin. More than 200 people have been killed in Aden in the past 11 days, according to Naef Al Bakri, Aden's deputy governor. Two days before al-Labani was killed, he told his family the last option was to try to cross the border into Oman and fly to Egypt, but he never made it. \"The airports got closed and things got worse and worse,\" Alazzani told CNN by phone. \"People were hoping things would get better, but they only got worse and worse.\" Yemen has been rocked by violence and political turmoil for months. Houthi rebels -- minority Shiites who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- forced Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from power in January, placing him under house arrest and taking over Sanaa, the country's capital. Hadi escaped in February, fled to the southern city of Aden and said he remained President. He fled to Saudi Arabia last month as the rebels and their military allies advanced on Aden. Now the violence is intensifying as Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations target the rebels in Yemen with airstrikes. Yemeni-Americans are trapped in the conflict, but haven't gotten enough help from the U.S. government, the Council on American-Islamic Relations told CNN Sunday. Zahra Billoo, a spokeswoman for the advocacy group, said it's helping al-Labani's family and the families of other Yemeni-Americans. \"All of these other governments, Russia, China, Ethiopia, India ... they have all been evacuating their citizens. So to say that it's impossible for the U.S. to evacuate their citizens is difficult to grasp,\" Billoo said. Responding to the criticism, the U.S. State Department told CNN that there are no current plans to evacuate private U.S. citizens from Yemen. \"We encourage all U.S. citizens to shelter in a secure location until they are able to depart safely. U.S. citizens wishing to depart should do so via commercial transportation options when they are available,\" a spokesman for the State Department told CNN in a statement. \"Additionally, some foreign governments may arrange transportation for their nationals and may be willing to offer assistance to others.\" Yemeni-American advocates think more could be done. \"There have been travel warnings to Yemen for a few years now. What's not clear is, are they saying 'Be cautious' or 'Don't go at all'?\" Billoo asked. \"It still it doesn't sit well with many of us civil rights lawyers who believe that U.S. citizenship should be the ultimate protection.\" Fierce fighting continued across Yemen on Sunday amid an electrical blackout in parts of the country and political moves that could further fracture the already divided military. Intense airstrikes hit Sanaa overnight. Senior security officials in the Yemeni capital said the airstrikes targeted the military intelligence headquarters and the Defense Ministry's central command, military bases and missile depots. The blasts at the military compounds, which are inside the city, shattered the windows of many homes nearby.

Tragic: Danielle Davis says she looked to her faith when she was faced with the prospect of losing her husband Brian in 2011, just seven months after they were married when he was involved in a near fatal motorcycle crash . Davis tells WTOC that doctors told her they would have chosen to pull the plug had they been in her position. 'That's what they'd want their family to do,' she recalls hearing them say. But she refused to give up and Brian was eventually released into her care. Weeks went by and one day, miraculously, Brian spoke. 'I'm trying,' he told her. Danielle would soon come to the painful conclusion that Brian had no idea she was his wife. Brian tells WTOC that he also had no clue his father was dead or that he'd been married to begin with. Three years had been wiped from his memory for good. Though, finding out Danielle was his wife was a happy moment among many struggles. 'I saw her, and I was like, 'yeah,'' he recalls. Hopeless: Brian's motorcycle was split in two and doctors initially urged his wife to take him off life support . Danielle refused to give up on Brian and took him into her full time care as he was still bedridden and hooked to a feeding tube . Miracle: Eventually, Brian started to improve and miraculously spoke the words 'I'm trying' one day weeks after Danielle took him home with dismal prospects . Now, he and Danielle work on his rehabilitation daily and use yoga to help him sharpen his mind and regain control of his body. While Danielle is thrilled that Brian has improved to the point he no longer requires medications, she says on a GoFundMe page started for the cause that the couple is too strapped to pay for all the rehabilitative care Brian still requires. And insurance will no longer cover it. 'People with Traumatic Brain Injury need a lot of rehab, people continue to make improvements even 10 years after their injury,' she writes. 'Insurance doesn't pay for the amount of therapy they need so often times that person doesn't reach their full potential.' Thankfully, after just one month, the fundraiser has received some $11,000 in donations. As Brian continues to make great strides, most recently with his commitment to learning to walk the way he once did, he wants others to know how good they've got it. 'People don't realize how much they can actually do with their bodies,' he said. 'They take it for granted.'

And whilst many Australians are enjoying an abundance of sugary treats, many are wondering how much it's going to cost them around the waistline. According to the ABC, the key is to maintain an even balance of 'energy in' and 'energy out.' This means that the energy we put into our bodies through food and drink must be equated with exercise to burn the energy and avoid gaining weight. A small chocolate bunny contains 2212 kjs and would take an hour and ten minutes of swimming to work off . Indulging in two hot cross buns (without jam and butter) will take up to 50 minutes of running to work off . It may be surprising how much physical exercise it takes in order to burn off even the smallest of Easter treats. For four solid mini chocolate Easter eggs it would take 30 to 40 minutes of walking to work off the 550 kilojoules. A female of average weight would need to walk for the full 40 minutes, whereas an 80 kilogram male could burn it off in 30 minutes. One medium chocolate bunny takes two and a half to three hours of kayaking with women needing to paddle for half an hour longer than men to work it off. The key for Easter indulgence is noting our 'energy in' and 'energy out' and balancing food and fitness . Experts are advising that it is better to manage our energy consumption than to try and work it off afterward . Two hot cross buns takes up to 50 minutes running and if you have lathered it with butter and jam, it would take 80 minutes of running. Exercise physiologist Alex Lawrence from Exercise Sport Science Australia has said that many Australians still struggle to maintain a healthy weight as most do not realise how many kilojoules are in the foods we consume. 'It's a lot more efficient to manage your energy consumption, than to try and work off the energy after you've taken it in,' he said. Lawrence is not proposing that we all go and heavily exercise after consuming a small treat. He advises that it is better to make exercise and healthy eating part of your lifestyle so that you can indulge in treats every now and then. 'What we're trying to encourage people to do is make better lifestyle choices; to eat treat foods in moderation and to make sure they are physically active most of the time. That way when holidays, like Easter, come around they don't have to feel like they have to deny themselves,' he said.", "reference": "The key for Easter indulgence is noting our 'energy in' and 'energy out'\nFor four mini Easter eggs it would take 30-40 minutes of walking to work off .\nTwo hot cross buns without butter take up to 50 minutes of running .\nIt is advised that we manage our energy consumption instead of working it off after it has been taken in ."}, "40": {"id": "8f2e026d1e9f9e4cc084edafda5e742f6b3005fc", "article": "A 27-year-old mother has been charged with child neglect and had her twins taken into care after her three-month-old daughter was found dead. The baby was found on the floor of the roach infested apartment with bites on her legs and head. Brittany Cherokee Dawn Bell of Bartlesville, Oklahoma, appeared in Washington County District Court via video monitor from jail on Monday. The charge of child neglect was pursued by authorities over homicide as the Medical Examiner's Office could not determine the cause of death. Police were called to Bell's home on January 8 after she reported the death of the infant. Brittany Cherokee Dawn Bell of Bartlesville, Oklahoma, was charged with child neglect after the death of her three-month-old daughter, whose body was found with roach bites on her legs and head . While Bell slept on the couch, baby Alice somehow suffocated on the floor nearby. It is unclear how this happened and for how long she lay there . Her initial story was that she had put the baby, Alice, in a crib and then found her dead later on. She then changed her story and admitted to laying the baby on the floor. Bell said that the baby might have been smothered by her 18-month-old twins out of jealousy after she had fallen asleep while watching a movie with them. She said she was afraid one of them had killed Alice by sitting on her, which was why she initially said the child was in the crib. An autopsy listed the cause of death as sudden unexplained infant death with the manner of death undetermined. The medical examiner found abrasions on Alice's legs and head caused by roaches that infested the apartment. In an affidavit, investigator Jim Warring said: 'I can conclude that she laid the baby on the floor and fell asleep without waking during which time Alice may have been suffocated by one or both of her twins or became distressed due to the surface of the floor and suffocated.' 'Also enough time passed that roaches were able to start feeding on both the baby's legs and head,' he added. 'All of this took place less than 10 feet from the couch where Bell was reportedly sleeping.' Bell's initial story was that she had put baby Alice in a crib and found her dead later on. She then changed her story, telling authorities that she was worried one of her twins had smothered the baby . The charge of child neglect relates to a previous incident, on December 31, when a neighbor called police concerned that the children had been left alone and were crying. Bell returned to the apartment approximately five minutes after officers arrived and claimed not to have been away for very long, and acted like it was not a big deal. Neighbors told police that the children had been left alone on other occasions. The twins were taken away from Bell after the death of Alice. Tulsa World\u00a0reported that Bell has other children but they are not in her care. The affidavit stated: 'Enough evidence and probable cause exists to determine that the defendant has acted in a reckless and neglectful manner that has been dangerous and possibly fatal to the children in her care and custody.'

Lincoln's two greatest legacies -- indivisible union and irreversible emancipation -- grew organically from his Midwestern roots. He knew firsthand that no defensible border shielded the land of corn from the land of cotton. The entire region from the Appalachians to the Rockies drained through the Mississippi River, enabling farmers in this vast basin to float their goods down to market through New Orleans and from there to the world. He thus could never allow a potentially hostile power to control this geostrategic chokepoint in particular, or Dixie more generally. The U.S. landmass, he insisted, \"is  well adapted to be the home of one national family; and it is not well adapted for two, or more\" because \"there is no line, straight or crooked, suitable for a national boundary upon which to divide.\" Lincoln supplemented his Midwestern geography lesson with a distinctly Midwestern claim about constitutional history: \"The Union is older than any of the States; and in fact, it created them as States.\" Lincoln did not need to make this controversial claim to prove his case, and elsewhere he stressed the decisive legal point that the Constitution's text clearly prohibits unilateral secession. The Constitution is always and everywhere the supreme law of the land -- no matter what an individual state says. But Lincoln's additional assertion that the Union created the states, not vice versa, provoked strong disagreement in other parts of the country. Most Virginians, including Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, insisted that of course Virginia had come first!  At the outbreak of the American Revolution, the Old Dominion was already a century and a half old. Generations of Lees had helped govern Virginia long before the United States was born. But if Lee was, first and always, a Virginian, Lincoln was an American. His father came from Virginia, his grandfather hailed from Pennsylvania, and before that, the family had probably lived in New England. Abe himself had been born in Kentucky and had moved as a boy to Indiana, and later, as a young man, to Illinois. These latter two Midwestern states had undeniably been formed by the Union itself. These places had begun as federal territory -- the common inheritance of all Americans -- and it was the federal government that had indeed brought these new states to life. When young Abe moved to Indiana, it was just becoming a state, thanks to federal governmental action. It was a wise set of federal policies -- proper land surveys and a commitment to public education -- that had drawn the Lincolns and countless other Kentuckians to leave the Bluegrass State for a brighter future in the Midwest. Retracing Lincoln's assassination 150 years later . That brighter future also involved freedom from slavery. The Old Northwest had always been free soil, as provided for by a Northwest Ordinance that predated the U.S. Constitution.  The words of the 13th  Amendment -- the only constitutional amendment that Lincoln would live to sign -- promised to end slavery everywhere in America and did so by borrowing verbatim from Article 6 of the Northwest Ordinance. True, geography is not inexorable destiny. Many other Midwesterners in Lincoln's era embraced slavery and secession. Hugo Black, the Supreme Court justice who did the most to make Lincoln's constitutional vision a reality over the next century, was born and raised in Alabama. But geographic variation has always been a large part of America's constitutional saga. In the 1860 election that brought him to power, Lincoln swept almost all the Northern states, but did miserably in the slaveholding south. John Wilkes Booth, the dastard who ended Lincoln's life 150 years ago this week, was an embittered extremist from a slave state. So was Lincoln's nemesis on the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Roger Taney. Taney's most infamous ruling, the pro-slavery Dred Scott decision in 1857, had emerged from a court dominated by the South; although slave states accounted for less a third of America's free population, this region held an absolute majority of the seats on the court. Remembering Lincoln's murder . In our era, given the fact that Republican appointees have held a majority of the court for the last 40 years, the court has been rather moderate. Much of this moderation has come courtesy of northern Republicans on the Court -- most notably, Minnesota's Harry Blackmun, Illinois' John Paul Stevens, and New Hampshire's David Souter. All nine of the current justices learned their law in liberal New England, at Harvard or Yale, and the Republican appointee most attentive to gay rights, Anthony Kennedy, grew up in northern California, a corner of the country renowned for its respect for alternative lifestyles. Which takes us back to Lincoln. When Anthony Kennedy was a lad in California's state capital, the governor, a friend of the Kennedy family, was a Lincoln Republican named Earl Warren -- a man who would later author the Court's iconic opinion in Brown v. Board of Education, vindicating the constitutional amendments enshrined by Lincoln and his allies. Today, both parties at their best claim Lincoln. Jeb Bush aims to appeal to the better angels of our nature and Rand Paul is a Kentuckian who professes interest in racial outreach. Hillary Clinton was born an Illinois Republican. And the leader of her adopted political party -- who also happens to be president -- is a lanky and brainy lawyer from Illinois who knows how to give a good speech, and who swept to power in 2008 by recreating Lincoln's geographic coalition, winning every state within a four-hour drive of Chicago. In the largest sense, then, all Americans, of both parties and all regions -- whether or not they have ever set foot in Illinois -- are living in the Land of Lincoln.", "reference": "Akhil Amar: Lincoln's two biggest legacies, keeping union together and abolishing slavery, had Midwestern roots .\nLincoln saw the federal government as pre-eminent and believed there was no logical border for dividing the U.S."}, "43": {"id": "b7679c4855b19edaf7504033b4219a2c0b9d1906", "article": "At his heaviest he tipped the scales at a mind-boggling 70st.

Appearing on UK breakfast television programme in 2013, in the week they met in person for the first time, she said she 'just felt compelled to reach out and just try to help and that's all it was.' 'I have a lot of drive and just thought I could write letters and support,' she said. 'Things I set my sights on, I just go and do. I just knew that I should try and help.

Mr Mason's binge eating began in his 20s at the time of his father's death and a deterioration in his mother's health. He quit his job as a postman when his weight stopped him from finishing his rounds. As his weight soared he was left unable to stand or walk before finally becoming bed-ridden and being looked after full time by council carers. Firefighters had to demolish the front wall of his former home so they could drive a fork lift truck inside to lift him out and put him into an ambulance when he needed a hernia operation in 2002. Mr Mason was later given a purpose-built housing association home with extra wide doorways so he could move around.

One of the chimpanzees was high up in a tree with a long branch. 'Apparently very calm and satisfied, half asleep in the morning sun, the primate let the drone make its curious images. 'Until..... the drone got just a bit too close. Once grounded, the chimp investigates its prey, taking a selfie in the process - before eventually wandering off.

The gases - desflurane, isoflurane and sevoflurane - are potent greenhouse gases that have 2,500 times the impact on global warming compared to carbon dioxide. Anaesthetic is used to send patients to sleep during surgery (above) but it may also be warming the planet . Atmospheric scientists who have been monitoring the gases say that while the concentrations in the atmosphere are low, they are having an increasing effect on the climate. Dr Martin Vollmer, who led the study at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Material Science and Technology in Dubendorf, Switzerland, said the anaesthetic gases were capable of storing far more energy from the sun than carbon dioxide. The world needs to prepare itself for a rapid increase in the speed of climate change, scientists have warned. Researchers have found evidence that suggests the rate at which temperatures are rising in the northern hemisphere could be 0.25\u00b0C per decade by 2020 - a level not seen for at least 1,000 years. The analysis, based on a combination of data from more than two dozen climate simulation models from around the world, looked at the rate of change in 40-year long time spans. Over the 900 years preceding the 20th century, 40-year warming trends rarely showed an average rate much higher than 0.1\u00b0C per decade, the study found. But by 2020 the rate was expected to have risen to an average of 0.25\u00b0C per decade, give or take 0.05\u00b0C. Different scenarios of future emissions showed that even at the lower end of greenhouse gas generation climate change picked up speed in the next 40 years. He said: 'On a kilogram-per-kilogram basis, it's so much more poten . 'Modern halogenated inhalation anesthetics undergo little metabolisation during clinical application and evaporate almost completely to the atmosphere.' The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, found that concentrations of desflurane reached 0.30 parts per trillion in 2014. Isoflurane, sevoflurane and halothane have reached 0.097, 0.13 and 0.0092 parts per trillion in the atmosphere respectively. By comparison, carbon dioxide gas currently makes up 400 parts per million in the atmosphere. However, one kilogram (2.2lbs) of desflurane produces the same greenhouse effect as 2,500 kg (5,512lbs) of carbon dioxide. The researchers estimate that anaesthetic gas emissions currently combine to produce the equivalent effect in the atmosphere of 3.1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. The research team did not examine the impact of nitrous oxide, another major component of anaesthetic, as it is released by many other sources. The researchers have been taking air samples from remote sites around the Northern Hemisphere since 2000 while they have also obtained air samples in the North Pacific and the South Shetland Islands in Antarctic. The gases escape through vents in operating rooms (pictured) when breathed out by patients and from masks . The team also used two hourly measurements at a high altitude observatory at Jungfraujoch, Switzerland since 2013 to track anaesthetic gases. They then used computer modelling to produce global estimates for the concentrations of these gases. The gases escape from hospital operating rooms via air vents during surgery. An estimated 280 tonnes of anaesthetic gases are used every year. Jodi Sherman, an anaesthesiologist at Yale University who reviewed the paper, said hospitals should consider using other chemicals in anaesthetic. She said: 'There's nothing unique about desflurane that we can't do with other drugs. 'Desflurane we could live without, and every little bit makes a difference. 'Health care in and of itself in the US is one of the worst polluting industries. Scientists say that hospitals should consider alternative anaesthetics when performing operations like above . 'It generates eight percent of US greenhouse gases according to one study. 'Add to this the fact that climate change has been recognized by the World Health Organization as the number one health issue of the 21st century, and it behooves us to do a better job with emissions.' However, Edmond Eger, an anaethesiologist at the University of California San Francisco, said: 'What the report fails to note is that a major factor determining the environmental effect is the manner in which the anesthetics are used. 'Many anesthetists deliver sevoflurane or isoflurane in a two - three liters per minute flow but deliver desflurane in a lower flow - 0.5 to one liter per minute. 'Some believe that desflurane has clinical advantages that argue for its continued use.'", "reference": "Gases used in anaesthetic in are accumulating in the Earth's atmopshere .\nThe gases - desflurane, isoflurane and sevoflurane - have a greenhouse effect that is 2,500 times more potent than carbon dioxide, say scientists .\nNew study finds their concentrations are relatively low but are increasing .\nScientists urge hospitals to find more environmentally friendly alternatives ."}, "47": {"id": "d1e16650f106feb63c5c2a2c1c6af1945946a63d", "article": "Hog\u2019s Breath Caf\u00e9 in Aspley is facing online criticism after a customer found a sink plug in her salad.

Having struck his second shot 163 yards to within six feet of the pin, Jordan Spieth stood over his ball on the 18th green. History was assured. He wasn\u2019t going to three-putt from there, so whatever happened this would be the lowest 36-hole score in the history of the Masters. He wanted it to be more than that, though. The best it could be. The exuberance of youth was kicking in. Spieth missed. For the first time around Augusta, he made a mild mis-step. He wheeled away, hopped a little, almost coltish in his frustration. He marched back to his ball, prepared to tap it in. Except it wasn\u2019t a real tap-in. There was a bit still to do. And at that point, Spieth checked. He stepped away. He marked his ball. He let Henrik Stenson play. He did the sensible thing. Spieth always does the sensible thing. That is part of his wonder. Jordan Spieth walks off the 18th after carding a 66 to finish 36 holes at a 14-under 130 . Spieth leads Charley Hoffman by five strokes, matching the largest halfway lead in Masters history . Some might think that makes him boring. It doesn\u2019t make him boring. To shoot 14 under, the lowest two-round score at Augusta, and equal to the best 36-hole score recorded at a major championship, isn\u2019t boring. We may be watching a sporting phenomenon. A performance as breathtaking as Tiger Woods\u2019s arrival in 1997. There will come a time when such comparisons no longer seem like hyperbole. If Spieth repeats his achievement at the Hero World Challenge in Florida last year, perhaps, when he led from wire to wire and recorded a score of 26 under par. Those numbers are unlikely though. As the tournament committee set out ever more fiendish pin placements in the next two days to preserve the dignity of the famous greenery, his scores are bound to fall. Against that, it will be a lot harder to chase Spieth\u2019s total than just maintain it. Modern courses have, of course, been Tiger-proofed before \u2014 but in the short term Augusta may need to be Spieth-proofed, too, if his scoring stays stable. This was his sixth round as a professional here and his worst score is level par. He has been in the top three players in five of those six, too. \u2018I was a bit out of my comfort zone, at the moment on the 18th,\u2019 Spieth confirmed. \u2018I was going to have to work around Henrik\u2019s line \u2014 and I just thought if I step away I am definitely going to make this putt, so that was the only way I could miss. \u2018I have to work to control those things the next two days. If I can shoot 14 under then a lot of other players could shoot 14 under, so I have to be ready for that and to match their scores now. The stress levels can get pretty high. Still, it\u2019s pretty cool any time you can lead the Masters and to set a record is awesome.\u2019 Spieth broke Raymond Floyd's 36-hole scoring record by a stroke and blitzed the first 36 holes . At the age of 21 and playing in his second Masters, Spieth looks in complete control . Billy Horschel, Spieth\u2019s playing partner, had wished for an imaginary tape recorder at the end of the first day. Horschel deadpanned that he needed a device that replayed the message \u2018Nice hole, Jordan\u2019 as they stood on every tee. Nothing changed overnight. Many had Augusta pegged as the venue where Rory McIlroy would complete his personal grand slam in 2015; instead, this Masters may go down as the moment where he was placed in the threatening shadow of a young Texan gunslinger, now in the vanguard of an American revival. Up ahead of Spieth, Ernie Els laboured valiantly to stay in touch. It was a salutary reminder of the need for good timing in any sporting career. At the age of 25, as McIlroy is now, Els won his first major, the 1994 US Open. He was considered capable of dominating the sport for the next decade, and he won it again in 1997. By that time, however, a 21-year-old called Tiger Woods had announced his arrival at the 1997 Masters. The era of Els never materialised. McIlroy may have achieved more and younger than Els, and Spieth may not be the ice-cold winning machine Woods was at his age \u2014 but he has done a damn good impression of one over the first two days. Already in the record books, Spieth has many more landmarks in sight these next two days. The record for birdies here stands at 25 from Phil Mickelson; Spieth already has 15. His course management was outstanding. Spieth took Augusta on, yet remained entirely in control. It helps that he is exceptional, yet strangely unspectacular. As Graeme McDowell pointed out recently there are better drivers, better chippers, better putters \u2014 and the statistics bear this out \u2014 but none who do all three as well as Spieth. He might not have the best game; but he has the most complete. There were tiny aberrations \u2014 he found the pine straw twice on the back nine \u2014 but they were rare. Most of the time, he was consistency personified, picking out the best line, the best lie, the most advantageous position on the green. When he dallied with a bunker on the par-five eighth, his third shot was so perfect that he sunk a two-foot putt for birdie. Spieth made 15 birdies through two rounds as he blazed his way around the Augusta fairways and greens . The young Texan pumps a fist to celebrate a birdie on the 13th during his sensational round . \u2018That was special, even for you,\u2019 said Horschel\u2019s caddie Micah Fugitt. It was a masterful display, the work of a wise head not a callow college boy. It isn\u2019t just that Spieth doesn\u2019t think like a 21-year-old. At the 15th, a par five and a good birdie opportunity, he sensibly laid up, and then made four. Even when he missed, he missed cute. He has absorbed a lot from his mentor Ben Crenshaw, a fellow Texan and Augusta expert. Asked about \u2018Ben\u2019s advice\u2019 on Thursday, Spieth sweetly replied: \u2018Do you mean Mr Crenshaw?\u2019 There wasn\u2019t a hint of irony in his response. Had he stayed in school, he would be studying for his finals right now. Instead he is fast approaching \u00a310m in career earnings and on the brink of a first major. The next Tiger? That is a heap of pressure to drop on young shoulders. The idea that McIlroy is without a serious challenger has been truly debunked. When Spieth shot 63 to win the Australian Open at Royal Sydney, the conditions were windy and inhospitable. McIlroy said he could have played the course a hundred times in those circumstances and not made Spieth\u2019s score. Geoff Ogilvy claimed it may well have been the finest 18 holes of golf seen in Australia. Where do Spieth\u2019s first 36 holes stand in the annals at Augusta? Ray Floyd played the previous best 36 holes \u2014 13 under par \u2014 in 1976. Spieth now has that record, as well as that of the youngest player to hold the 18-hole lead. Like McIlroy\u2019s US Open victory at Congressional in 2011 this could see a grand rewriting of the record books. He has barely put a foot wrong. Nice hole, Jordan?

A jilted lover who sent explicit revenge porn images of his ex-partner to her daughter and set up 67 Facebook profiles to bombard her with abuse has been jailed. Jason Cotterill, 42, plagued his victim with abusive messages over the internet after she tried to end their relationship in October last year. A court heard he also emailed the woman a link to an online sex video she was in - and threatened to post it on to her Facebook page. Cotterill knew his victim from childhood and knew that she had been previously involved in making sex tapes, Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard. He and the victim had attended the same school when they were children but got back in contact through Facebook in 2013. They met up for three dates between January and September 2013 but had sex on just one occasion. The court was told that\u00a0the mother - a former sex worker - immediately regretted the liaison and told her lover she did not want to see him again. Soon afterwards she began receiving 'creepy' messages from the defendant,\u00a0saying he loved her and wanted to be with her. As a result, she\u00a0'unfriended' him on Facebook and changed her mobile phone number. During the trial the woman told the court he set up 67 different Facebook in an attempt to contact her after she blocked him on the social networking site. She said: 'He started setting up different profiles on Facebook to send me messages. He also sent my family messages and my friends messages because he couldn't get to me. 'I was very upset, it drove me insane, it made me depressed. I'm on medication. 'His language was absolutely disgusting. He was asking me why I wasn't playing any more, calling me names.' The victim said Cotterill found pictures of her on the internet that he threatened to send to her family and friends. He sent more than one to her daughter, she said. Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard he also emailed the woman a link to an online sex video she was in - and threatened to post it on her Facebook page. Cotterill knew his victim from childhood and knew that she had been previously involved in making sex tapes . In October last year, Cotterill sent the victim a link to an x-rated explicit video with a message that said: 'F**k it, I'm going to have it as my profile picture'. He also taunted the victim on Facebook, telling her: 'I am going to send some more pictures too because it's fun lol.' The 42-year-old was 'driven insane' and suffered depression and panic attacks after Cotterill spent a year sending 'disgusting' messages. David Houldcroft, defending, said Cotterill, who had two previous\u00a0convictions for harassment, accepted sending the link and that it would have caused her upset. Cotterill, of Oldbury, was jailed for 12 weeks and had previously been found guilty of harassment following a trial. As well as being jailed, he was also banned indefinitely from contacting his victim . 'He regrets that and understands that he has problems with relationships,' Mr Houldcroft said.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell (above)\u00a0has been criticized for not doing enough to prevent players from getting concussions . The league's top lawyer said Brody's approval 'powerfully underscores the fairness and propriety' of the settlement. 'Retirees and their families will be eligible for prompt and substantial benefits and will avoid years of costly litigation that \u2014 as Judge Brody's comprehensive opinion makes clear \u2014 would have an uncertain prospect of success,' NFL general counsel Jeff Pash said in a statement. The total NFL payouts over 65 years, including interest and $112million sought for lawyer fees, is expected to be more than $1billion. Critics contend the NFL is getting off lightly given annual revenues of about $10billion. However, plaintiffs would have first had to fight their way into court \u2014 instead of getting booted to NFL mediation under their players' contracts \u2014 to prevail.

An autopsy showed he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE . 'From a business point of view, (the NFL has)...avoided what may have been the biggest risk to their continued prosperity,' said Andrew Brandt, director of the sports law program at Villanova University law school. 'Removing this as a threat is extraordinary,' he said. The NFL lawsuits, and similar suits filed later against the NHL, the NCAA and others, has fostered debate, discussion and safety reforms about sports concussions. Yet the NFL games seem to be as wildly popular as ever. 'I know people talk about, it's dangerous, and mothers won't let their sons play football. But I don't see that. I don't see that at all,' Brandt said. About 200 NFL retirees or their families have rejected the settlement and plan to sue the league individually. They include the family of Junior Seau, the popular Pro Bowler who killed himself at his San Diego-area home in 2012 after several years of increasingly erratic behavior.

The NFL earlier this year said concussions have dropped by 36 per cent after they changed the way players tackle (above David Bruton #30 of the Denver Broncos lies on the ground in pain in 2014) Brody most recently asked for several tweaks, including partial credit for time played in NFL Europe and other developmental leagues, to broaden the settlement. Negotiators quickly agreed to her suggestions. She rejected other complaints raised at a November hearing, including those who say the agreement does not cover future deaths from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease that can only be diagnosed after death, or contemplate the day when it might be diagnosed in the living. Others oppose the award reductions for older men and those who played fewer than five years in the league. 'Although objectors insist that there must be compensation for CTE, the NFL parties were unwilling to settle claims based solely on a (diagnosis) ... rather than on manifest neurocognitive deficits,' the lead negotiators wrote in a March court filing urging Brody to approve the deal.

Hebshi, who has a Jewish mother and Saudi Arabian father, has said she was ethnically profiled based on her dark complexion. 'I filed this lawsuit because I didn't want others to experience the kind of unnecessary trauma that I did, and it has given me faith that the justice system can work to protect constitutional rights,' Hebshi said in a release. 'This settlement gives me some peace of mind. Now, I feel like I can finally put the incident behind me.' Hebshi of Sylvania, Ohio, was traveling home after visiting a sister in California when was removed from the Frontier Airlines flight after it landed Sept. 11, 2011. She was seated next to two Indian-American men, whom crew members had said spent a lot of time in the plane's bathroom. All three were detained, according to the ACLU. Hebshi was held for hours before being released. The two men also were released. 'People do not forfeit their constitutional rights when they step onto an airplane,' said ACLU attorney Rachel Goodman.

Ethnically profiled: Shoshana Hebshi, a woman of Arab and Jewish descent was strip-searched at Detroit Metropolitan Airport on the 10th anniversary on 9/11 . 'This settlement sends that critical message, and will help protect future passengers from having to endure what Shoshana went through.' The Airport Authority said its insurer agreed to a financial settlement to avoid 'further time-consuming and costly litigation.' That amount was not released. Airport police 'acted quickly and responsibly, and followed appropriate protocols in responding to a request for help from one of our airline partners,' Authority Chief Executive Thomas Naughton said in a release. 'I strongly support their actions. We remain committed to vigilantly protecting the safety of the travelling public.' As part of the settlement, Frontier will amend its employee handbook to more clearly state its zero-tolerance policy on discrimination and provide all new employees with training on that revision. The airline also will amend its customer complaint policy to ensure allegations of discrimination are given appropriate attention. Frontier Airlines declined to comment on the settlement.

Celebrating his win at the Chinese Grand Prix on Sunday, he sprayed champagne straight into the face of one of the hostesses. But a leading group which campaigns against sexism has condemned the behavior of the driver - who used to date ex-Pussy Cat Doll Nicole Scherzinger - as 'selfish and inconsiderate', saying he should be forced to apologise for 'specially directing' the bubbly into the woman's face. Others have called the driving ace an 'embarrassment to the UK', while another said his behaviour showed that he was an 'ignorant clown'. Scroll down for video . Right in the ear: Lewis Hamilton celebrates winning the Chinese Grand Prix by spraying the hostess in the face with champagne . Not impressed: The hostess looks less than impressed as she is sprayed with champagne on the podium in Shanghai on Sunday . Trademark move: It's not the first time the racing ace has sprayed a grid girl with bubbly - he's also done it after winning the Spanish Grand Prix and even at the Austrian Grand Prix, where he lost out on the top spot . Caught by surprise: The hostess's colleagues laugh in the background as she gets a soaking from the champion British racing driver . Drenched: Hamilton\u00a0controlled the contest in Shanghai to seal his second victory in three races and extend his lead at the summit of the Formula One world championship . Roz Hardie, chief executive of Object, a campaign on media sexism and 'sex object culture', said: 'The photographs appear to show that the woman is not just being splashed, but that the champagne is being very specifically directed into her face, which does not look like a voluntary piece of horseplay on her part. 'If this if the case we think Lewis Hamilton should apologise for his actions and think carefully about how he behaves in the future.\u00a0For most people, it would be apparent that she is not enjoying it. 'It is surely a very difficult position to be a grid girl and she would have had little option but to stand there and take it. That is something of which he should be aware. But instead, he appears to have abused her position. 'It's unfortunate that a great victory has been marred by what appears to be selfish and inconsiderate behaviour.' Ms Hardie added that the episode highlighted the more general issue of women being viewed as sexual objects in the motoring world. She said: 'Motor racing appears to unnecessarily portray women as sexualised objects and that probably makes it even harder for the women to stand up for themselves. We would hope people in the industry would be respectful to these women. On Twitter, Hamilton was described as a 'bully' and 'disgusting'.\u00a0Another user simply said: 'Man please stop spraying Champagne on the Podium Ladies. They don't like it', while one outraged user said he was a 'scumbag - an embarrassment to UK'. Another wrote: 'Have a bit more respect for the ladies please. Spraying Champagne in her face was out of order #child #idiot.' And one tweeted: 'Shame on you F1 and Lewis Hamilton for disgraceful treatment of women during champagne celebration#sexism.' It is not the first time the racing icon has whipped out his victory move. He celebrated in a similar fashion after winning Spanish Grand Prix last year, which was his fourth consecutive win in a row and\u00a0the one that finally put him on top of the World Championship table. And although he lost the Austrian Grand Prix to teammate Nico Rosberg, he didn't shy away from popping the cork directly at a hostess. The 30-year-old was even asked to demonstrate his champagne skills on Graham Norton's talk show in 2013. Sprayed: He's made it a signature move, here Hamilton sprays a hostess at Montmelo at the Spanish Grand Prix\u00a0at Circuit de Catalunya . But not everyone was offended by his behaviour. Many found his actions amusing, while another said: 'I can think of worse things to happen at work than getting sprayed in the face with champagne by @LewisHamilton.. Lighten up people!' Hamilton controlled the contest in Shanghai to seal his second victory in three races and extend his lead at the summit of the Formula One world championship yesterday. But it wasn't all smiles at yesterday's race after a serious feud was sparked between Hamilton and his teammate Nico Rosberg, following a press conference. His Mercedes partner accused him of severely compromising his strategy and leaving him under unnecessary pressure from Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel. With the top three drivers covered by only 3.5 seconds ahead of the final round of pit-stops, Rosberg reported on the radio that \u2018Lewis is driving very slowly. Tell him to speed up.\u2019 Hamilton, seemingly protecting his tyres, was given the hurry-up by Mercedes and both he and Rosberg eventually emerged from their final pit-stop first and second with Vettel third. The world champion, sitting beside his teammate, told the press conference yesterday: 'I wasn't controlling his race, I was controlling my own race. 'My goal was to look after my car. I had no real threat from Nico throughout the whole race.' Soaked: It wasn't all smiles after a serious feud was sparked between Hamilton and his teammate Nico Rosberg, following a press conference . Smiles: The Mercedes driver poses with his trophy and champagne bottle on the podium after winning the Chinese Formula One on Sunday . A visibly angry Rosberg replied: 'It's just now interesting to hear from you Lewis that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front when that was compromising my race. 'Driving slower than was maybe necessary in the beginning of the stint meant Sebastian was close to me and it opened up the opportunity for Sebastian to try an early pit stop to try and jump me and then I had to cover him. 'It was unnecessarily close with Sebastian as a result, and also it cost me a lot of race time because I had to cover him. Then my tyres died at the end of the race because my stint was just so much longer, so I'm unhappy about that.' The spat has reopened the wounds from last year when both men tried to out-manoeuvre, and at times out-pysch one another as their battle for the title unfolded. It culminated in the pair colliding with one another in the Belgian Grand Prix, resulting in Rosberg being reprimanded and sanctioned by the team. This proved to be a turning point in the championship as Hamilton went on to dominate the closing races en route to taking his second crown.

At least 10 Iraqi security forces were killed in the attacks, according to Faleh al-Essawi, the deputy head of Iraq's Anbar provincial council. And the head of the Iraqi military operation in Anbar province, Gen. Qassim al-Muhammadi, was wounded. The northern Ramadi districts of Albu Faraj, Albu Essa and Albu Risha were in the hands of ISIS by the time the day was done. Located about 70 miles (110 kilometers) west of Baghdad, Ramadi has seen intense and persistent fighting for months. ISIS took over parts of that western Anbar city in the first half of 2014, and it's been part of a tug of war ever since. Iraqi security forces discovered tunnels in February that they say could have led opposition fighters to a central government compound in the city.  But they didn't find all of them: A few weeks later, ISIS detonated hundreds of homemade bombs from a tunnel underneath an army headquarters there, according to Sabah Al-Karhout, the head of the Anbar provincial council. More than 40 Iraqi soldiers died in that explosion. Iraqi and allied forces have made inroads in recent weeks, beating back the group that calls itself the Islamic State, which took over vast swaths of Iraq and neighboring Syria last year. Their most high-profile victory, for instance, was the recapture of Tikrit. And U.S.-led airstrikes have already made a difference, according to officials in Washington and beyond. Still, ISIS remains a formidable force and, as the Ramadi assault shows, one that's still capable and willing to go on offense to take territory. That may be best illustrated by the case of Mosul, Iraq's second largest city and the site of one of its biggest embarrassments when Iraqi soldiers and police dropped their weapons and fled their posts as ISIS forces advanced last June. A U.S. official said in February that up to 25,000 Iraqis troops were expected to return to the key northern Iraqi city in April or May. But, on Thursday, a senior official in U.S. President Barack Obama's administration appeared to back away from that timeline -- saying an Iraqi-led assault on Mosul \"might be some time from now (or) might be soon.\" Calling for \"patience,\" an administration official said that winning Mosul is a complex endeavor. The same could be said for the entire effort to defeat ISIS. It will \"take a lot of capacity,\" the official said, \"and some time to build.\" CNN's Kim Acosta contributed to this report.", "reference": "Anbar provincial official: Suicide and car bombs were part of the ISIS assault .\nIraqi and allied forces have had recent success, but ISIS remains powerful ."}, "56": {"id": "9592ae805b1aa79a651641c19bb1f651e72bf223", "article": "Nigel Farage has revealed his preparation technique for tonight's crunch election debate \u2013 no booze until 6pm.

There will only be ten barrels of beer made and it won't be available in shops but there is talk of mass production if the drink proves popular. In the report, Robert Baumgartner, an assistant director at Clean Water Services, told regulators it was designed to 'raise awareness of the reusable nature of all water'. 'By highlighting craft beer, a product Oregon is known for around the world, the project will seek to engage... people everywhere in a conversation about water,' he continued.

Lowes, Industrie, Best & Less and the Just Group - which includes Just Jeans, Portmans and Dotti - were identified as some of the worst performing companies by The 2015 Australian Fashion Report. Amongst the best performers were Etiko, Audrey Blue, Cotton On, H&M and Zara. The report assessed the labour rights management systems of 59 companies and 219 brands operating in Australia. The 2015 Australian Fashion Report has named and shamed some of the worst Aussie clothing brands and companies for their ongoing exploitation of overseas workers . Amongst the best performers were Etiko, Audrey Blue, Cotton On, H&M and Zara . It found that only two of the companies could prove they were paying a full living wage to the workers in two of the three production stages of their clothing. None of the 59 companies could prove the workers at their raw material suppliers were paid a living wage. Unlike a country's legally set minimum wage, a living wage ensures that an employee has enough money to cover the necessities - like food, water, electricity and shelter - and still has a little left over for themselves and their dependants. In some countries like Bangladesh, where the minimum wage is as little as US$68 a month and a living wage is US$104, the difference can be made by paying each worker just an additional 30c per t-shirt. Lowes, Industrie, Best & Less and the Just Group - which includes Just Jeans, Portmans and Dotti - were identified as some of the worst performers . 'The whole point in our reporting scorecard is if these companies don't have rigours systems in place to mitigate against those risks then you can't be sure that there is no forced labour or child labour in their supply chain,' Gershon Nimbalker, an advocacy manager at Baptist World Aid, said . 'A mere 12 per cent of companies could demonstrate any action towards paying wages above the legal minimum, and even then, only for part of their supply chain,' the report states. 'Furthermore, 91 per cent of companies still don't know where all their cotton comes from and 75 per cent don't know the source of all their fabrics and inputs. 'If companies don't know how and where their products are made, then there's no way for them to ensure that their workers are protected.' Uzbekistan for instance, the world's fifth largest exporter of cotton, was notorious for its  child labour policies which saw children as young as 10 forced to work in the fields until the government recently  improved conditions by renouncing the use of child labour 'on a systematic basis'. 'Furthermore, 91 per cent of companies still don't know where all their cotton comes from and 75 per cent don't know the source of all their fabrics and inputs,' the report stated . Gershon Nimbalker, an advocacy manager at Baptist World Aid told Daily Mail Australia that part of the motivation behind the report was to shed light on how many of the world's 165 million children involved in child labour were employed by the fashion industry. 'The whole point in our reporting scorecard is if these companies don't have rigours systems in place to mitigate against those risks then you can't be sure that there is no forced labour or child labour in their supply chain,' he said. 'There were 61 assessment criteria that we used to grade the companies that were put together with lots of collaboration with international labour rights organisations. 'We found all the public information available on the companies - public statements, anything online - and compiled and assessed it before sending a copy to the company and asking for feedback or asking them to tell us what we missed. The report comes almost two years after over 1,100 Bangladeshi garment workers died when the Rana Plaza factory collapsed in Bangladesh due to building safety problems . 'We found all the public information available on the companies - public statements, anything online - and compiled and assessed it before sending a copy to the company and asking for feedback or asking them to tell us what we missed. 'The worst grades basically mean that they have very little public information available about what they're doing to protect workers and on top of that that they haven't engaged with our research process. About 75 per cent did engage, but one quarter didn't.'

The unofficial 2012 paperback book was revealed by a plaintiff in a lawsuit filed by four sexual-assault victims who want to stop the practice of sexual assault allegations within the military being handled by commanding officers. Former Tech. Sgt. Jennifer Smith, who said she was sexually assaulted by a fellow airman in Iraq, brought forward the songbook and she had filed an administrative complaint over the book in 2012. A book of songs used by the U.S. Air Force contains horrifying lyrics about rape, pedophilia and homosexuality . The complaint alleges some of the most disturbing content is found in the songbooks of the 55th, 77th, and 79th fighter squadrons of the Air Force . But Smith said the general assigned to address her complaint also sang the sexist songs with the airmen regularly and she did not hear back from him. Set to the tune of \u00a0Bye Bye Blackbird: . Back your a** against the wall, here I come b**** and all, bye, bye cherry. I know I ain't got a lot, but what I got will fill your t***, bye bye cherry. I took her to my cottage in the wild woods, . And there I took advantage of her childhood. Oh my God, it was nice, cherry bye bye. The complaint alleges some of the most disturbing content is found in the songbooks of the 55th, 77th, and 79th fighter squadrons of the Air Force, reports ABC News. The 130-page songbook contains 70 songs with titles including Pubic Hair, The Kotex Song and Bestiality. One of them, The S&M Man, is set to the tune of The Candy Man and describes sexually mutilating women and dragging AIDS victims behind a bus. Another one of them comes with the warning: 'THIS SONG IS ONLY FOR A VERY FEW SICK PEOPLE!!!!' A section of the book reads: 'This book is our thoughts, our songs and our games. 'Lesser individuals who have never strapped their a**** to a piece of flaming metal will considers these of little or no redeeming value. Because of this, the songs contained in this book are held as sacred by those of us that have.'

In a press conference Tuesday on the lawsuit, Smith said co-workers mocked and harassed her after she complained. 'I filed a formal complaint,' Smith said, reports USA Today. 'Six officers were punished in my case. All the officers received nothing more than a piece of paper reprimanding them for their behavior. All will still lead. All will oversee airmen and sexual assault claims.' In her original complaint, Smith also said she was sexually assaulted by her master sergeant in Germany. Smith escaped that assault when several other airmen intervened. Retired Air Force Col. Don Christensen, president of Protect Our Defenders, an advocacy group for military sex assault victims told Stars and Stripes: 'This is something that is used by Air Force officers today. 'These are the commanders who sing songs about raping women as fun.' The book is bound to look like an official Air Force publication - the bottom of its pages are labeled 'For Unofficial Use Only. Former Tech. Sgt. Jennifer Smith, \u00a0(pictured) who said she was sexually assaulted by a fellow airman in Iraq, brought forward the songbook and she had filed an administrative complaint over the book in 2012 . Air Force spokeswoman Capt. Brooke Brzozowske didn't comment on the lawsuit itself to ABC News, but said the book was from 2012, before the Air Force initiating a health and welfare inspections program where such materials would have been confiscated. She said the Air Force had contacted the Inspectors General to make sure the books were not still in use. She told Stars and Stripes that as a result of a 2012 six-month investigation there were 16 allegations against eight officers at Shaw Air Force Base who failed to prevent or investigate sexual harassment, condoned or refused to remove sexually offensive material and tolerated on-duty alcohol consumption. In 2014 there were nearly 6,000 victims of sexual assault in the U.S. military this year, up eight per cent from last year, according to a study. The Pentagon report, based on an anonymous survey and shared with the Associated Press, also found that retaliation remains an ongoing problem in stern military culture that emphasizes rank, loyalty and strength. Indeed, 60per cent of the women who reported some type of unwanted sexual contact complained about social backlash from co-workers or other service members. Under fire from Congress, Pentagon leaders and the White House, the military services have launched programs to encourage reporting, provide better care for victims, step up prosecutions and urge troops to intervene when they see others in threatening situations.

A dossier on Lord Janner is among 114 files on child sex abuse that has vanished from the Home Office, it was revealed today. The 1986 Janner file is mentioned in an investigation into an alleged government cover up but its contents remain a mystery. The Home Office has refused to comment on the dossier, which could potentially conceal the name of a second person, it is alleged. Last year NSPCC boss Peter Wanless led a review of Home Office files from 1979 to 1999 and concluded it would be 'impossible' to unearth this and the other 113 missing files. According to the Daily Mirror the paper, titled \u2018Greville Janner MP [redacted] re evidence in child abuse cases\u2019 is listed as \u2018not found\u2019 and \u2018presumed transferred to the MoJ [Ministry of Justice] but not located\u2019.

An explosive dossier compiled by MP Geoffrey Dickens is believed to be among 114 files known to have been lost or destroyed by the Home Office. In 1983 the Tory MP for Huddersfield West said he had eight names of 'really important, public figures' who unless they were arrested he would \u2018expose in Parliament\u2019. Based on his descriptions, these are thought to include MPs, civil servants, a diplomat and even a Buckingham Palace official. Some had links to the Paedophile Information Exchange, who wanted sex with children legalised, he said. Dickens handed his '40-page dossier' to the then Home Secretary Leon Brittan, which set out allegations of a paedophile circle \u2018operating and networking within and around\u2019 the Westminster elite. Another copy was kept by Mr Dickens' wife and another was allegedly handed to the then Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Thomas Hetherington and then the police. All the copies vanished and nothing came of the investigations but now the Dickens dossier is central to allegations that there was a high level cover-up to protect those in power. 'But I have to apply the code for Crown Prosecutors and that means I look at the evidence first: I was satisfied there was a realistic prospect of conviction. 'And then I look at the public interest, which means taking into account Lord Janner\u2019s medical condition and his dementia, which is so severe that in my view he would not be able to stand trial.

The most powerful woman in the NHS is facing the threat of a new inquiry into claims that she put patient safety at risk in a drive to meet targets, the Mail can reveal. Dame Barbara Hakin, national director of commissioning operations for NHS England, was accused of gagging a whistleblower who tried to warn about the impact of targets on ordinary patients. She was investigated by the General Medical Council, which concluded that there was no case to answer. However, it is now reviewing part of this decision and is appointing an independent expert to consider if the original investigation went \u2018far enough\u2019 in respect of patient safety. The GMC is concerned that there \u2018may have been a material flaw\u2019 in the previous decision, which could lead to the case being reopened. Dame Barbara, 57, a former Bradford GP who worked alongside Sir David Nicholson when he was NHS chief, was criticised for the gagging of whistleblower Gary Walker while she was in charge of East Midlands Strategic Health Authority. Mr Walker and other senior executives at the United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust (ULHT) claim that they had raised concerns with her that the enforcement of targets \u2013 implemented by the last Labour government \u2013 was endangering lives. This, they alleged, contributed to the trust being in the bottom 25 of the Department of Health\u2019s mortality league tables and being compared to the scandal-hit Mid Staffs. They took their allegations to the GMC, the regulatory body for doctors, who investigated but concluded that there was no case to answer. But following complaints to the watchdog about its review, it is calling for an independent report. The GMC said the absence of such a report \u2018may amount to a material flaw in the investigation\u2019 that may have affected the decision. \u2018There are concerns that the evidence gathered in the initial investigation did not go far enough in relation to allegations surrounding patient safety,\u2019 it said. The GMC concluded that the review is \u2018necessary for the protection of the public\u2019. Dame Barbara, 57, a former GP, was criticised for the gagging of whistleblower Gary Walker (above), who tried to warn about the impact of targets, while she was in charge of East Midlands Strategic Health Authority . It added: \u2018The specific question here is whether Dr Hakin\u2019s fitness to practise could be called into question on the basis of her insistence that ULHT met the NHS targets no matter what. Further evidence from an external independent expert would have been useful to consider whether Dr Hakin\u2019s actions were reasonable in all of the circumstances.\u2019 Dame Barbara, who earns around \u00a3205,000 in her current role and was referred to as the most powerful woman in the NHS by the Health Service Journal, said the original allegations were \u2018spurious and vexatious\u2019.

This weekend saw its TV channel sidekicks deliver a double header with a new ally to help set the scene. This no doubt will have the purists, and perhaps even some fans of the four teams involved, spitting at the very mention. But with Wembley on board for both games, I doubt the BBC and BT Sport will have minded presenting their coverage from HQ. However, on Saturday evening, Ian Wright was dead sheepish about it in the BBC\u2019s on-site studio. \u2018I don\u2019t like semi finals at Wembley\u2019, said Wrighty squirming awkwardly in his seat at the prospect of it. Well, some twenty four hour or so later, Wembley was certainly delighted to host them. Arsenal players celebrate during the victory over Reading which saw the Gunners reach the FA Cup final . Fabian Delph (centre) is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring against Liverpool at Wembley . Wembley Stadium was a great setting for this weekend's two FA Cup semi-final clashes . Prior to that first clash on Saturday between Arsenal and Reading, there had also been disgruntled talk from inside the Emirates Stadium. This time about the fact the match clashed with the big Premier league game between Chelsea and Manchester United. Yes, over on Sky Sports, you could have witnessed business as usual at Stamford Bridge. With a first half that Jamie Redknapp at one point described as \u2018difficult to watch\u2019. If you weren\u2019t watching Chelsea's victory, what you could see instead was what turned out to be a genuine sporting event, a real footballing occasion. Alongside Wright, the extremely engaging Jason Roberts hoped his old club Reading wouldn\u2019t treat their premature trip to north west London as \u2018a day out' and believed there was a chance the Royals could win against Arsenal. Well, they most certainly set aside the chance for some selfies and instead contributed wholly to a cracking game of football. A clash that was bursting out of the telly screen with atmosphere as the sun soaked some thrilling football and the crowd generated a groundswell of excitement. Reading, pictured celebrating after Garath McCleary's goal, contributed to a great encounter on Saturday . What\u2019s more, there were also a couple of errors that led to two memorable moments in the coverage. Firstly, when a film about the infamous 1990 FA Cup Semi Finals failed, Gary Lineker was left with a spare few minutes to fill. Which he did with a great chat about his guests' Cup Final Wembley memories. \u2018It\u2019s a wonderful experience, winning an FA Cup, isn\u2019t it Wrighty?\u2019, observed Lineker before turning to the distinctly pot free Alan Shearer. \u2018Don\u2019t start again, Gary!\u2019, barked Al, his brief annoyance serving only to make the moment even funnier for his fellow ex pros. And then there was Reading\u2019s Adam Federici. I was amazed at the end of the game when the director went through the familiar montage of close ups, and while doing so chose to cut away from manager Steve Clarke beginning to console his crestfallen keeper. A few minutes later, they did decide to show it, though. I almost wished they hadn\u2019t as it was nearly too harrowing to watch the poor fella\u2019s suffering. Nevertheless it was compelling stuff, and helped seal that first semi final as something a bit special. Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici (centre) is consoled by Royals boss Steve Clarke after the final whistle . Come Sunday, and the man who would be drawing the camera\u2019s unblinking gaze was this time established right from the get go. As soon as Steven Gerrard was announced in the starting line up, there was no doubt which player was going to be at the heart of BT Sport\u2019s story. Although it wasn\u2019t  all about the outgoing captain. They opened their coverage with a lovely little film in which two young fans - Villa\u2019s Tom and Liverpool\u2019s John-Paul (naturally!) - recreated each team\u2019s cup runs in their back gardens. We then saw the two young stars walking up Wembley way together, helping to remind us about the supporter\u2019s part in the occasion. This was reiterated with a pre-match lap of the pitch by host Jake Humphrey and his pundits which really drew those of us at home into the moment. It also enabled us to hear the Villa fans give Robbie Savage a, shall we say, robust welcome as he approached their end! Former Birmingham City midfielder Robbie Savage (right) received a robust welcome from the Villa faithful . From the moment we first saw Stevie G trotting out onto the pitch to warm up, right up until the moment  commentator Ian Darke exclaimed \u2018off the line, Gerrard\u2019s header\u2019, the outgoing skipper was very rarely far from the centre of attention. Come the final whistle, the Liverpool captain was clearly reluctant to be. It was something BT handled very cleverly by using their inset box innovation to show the on pitch interview with Man of the Match Fabian Delph as the main shot showed Gerrard sullenly leaving the Wembley turf for possibly the last time. Yet another moment that made Wembley the ideal setting for an FA Cup semi-final TV audience to enjoy even more magic from this season\u2019s tournament? I\u2019ll leave that thought with you.

The ex-Rangers youth has been mourning the loss of Shaun Cole, 22, who was found dead in a Miami street last weekend and is thought to have been the victim of a hit-and-run driver. A soldier who had served in Afghanistan, he was on holiday in Florida while on leave and had attended a music festival there before being found on a pavement with a head injury which proved fatal. Livingston boss Mark Burchill is hopeful that midfielder Darren Cole will turn out for his side on Sunday . Livingston star Cole, 23, was close to Shaun and paid tribute to the army private on his Twitter account this week. He wrote: 'I know you won't be here for the rest of our lives but I can promise I'll love you for the rest of mine.' Cole was granted time off by the Championship side as they prepare to face Alloa at McDiarmid Park in their first national final in 11 years. But he returned to training on Wednesday and is due to work with the players again after a squad day off on Thursday. Burchill is not putting any pressure on the 23-year-old to play despite the fact he has been a key member of the team since signing a short-term deal in February. He will give Cole as much time as he needs to grieve and accept whatever decision he makes - but admits that the former Murray Park youngster has given the impression he would like to be involved. Burchill said: 'Darren was away from the club initially and we don't really know what to expect but I am speaking with him constantly to plan with him. 'He came back to training on Wednesday but is still in a bit of shock after what has happened, which is completely understandable. 'If I'm honest, I really don't know if he is going to play so we will need to see how things go once we get towards Saturday and Sunday. 'I think Darren would like to play but he has never been through something like this before in his life. 'Him and Shaun were much closer than a lot of cousins are. They grew up together, were around the same age and lived in the same area. They were best mates. 'Darren and his family want to find out exactly what happened and get a wee bit of closure because they still don't know the circumstances. 'We will do everything we can as a club to keep his head straight. It goes without saying we would like him to be involved and I think he would like to be.

Her Tuesday morning visit to a coffee shop in LeClaire, Iowa was staged from beginning to end, according to Austin Bird, one of the men pictured sitting at the table with Mrs. Clinton. Bird told Daily Mail Online that campaign staffer Troy Price called and asked him and two other young people to meet him Tuesday morning at a restaurant in Davenport, a nearby city. Price then drove them to the coffee house to meet Clinton after vetting them for about a half-hour. The three got the lion's share of Mrs. Clinton's time and participated in what breathless news reports described as a 'roundtable'\u2013 the first of many in her brief Iowa campaign swing. Bird himself is a frequent participant in Iowa Democratic Party events. He interned with President Obama's 2012 presidential re-election campaign, and was tapped to chauffeur Vice President Joe Biden in October 2014 when he visited Davenport. 'What happened is, we were just asked to be there by Troy,' Bird said Wednesday in a phone interview. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . STAGED: Clinton sat to talk with three young Iowans at a coffee shop on Tuesday \u2013 all of whom were driven to the event by her Iowa campaign's political director . NOT SO ORDINARY: Austin Bird is a Democratic Party insider who chauffeured Vice President Joe Biden around Davenport, Iowa in October during a pre-election campaign trip . 'We were asked to come to a meeting with Troy, the three of us, at the Village Inn.' The other two, he confirmed, were University of Iowa College Democrats president Carter Bell and Planned Parenthood of the Heartland employee Sara Sedlacek. 'It was supposed to be a strategy meeting,' Bird recalled, 'to get our thoughts about issues. But then all of a sudden he says, \"Hey, we have Secretary Clinton coming in, would you like to go meet her?\"' 'And then we got in a car \u2013 Troy's car \u2013 and we went up to the coffee house, and we sat at a table and then Hillary just came up and talked with us.' Bird said 'we all were called.' 'I mean, Troy asked us all to do \u2013 to go to a meeting with him. And we didn't really know what it was about. I mean, he did. He knew.' It's unclear how many Iowans featured in photographs with Clinton that rocketed around the country on Tuesday were planted. 'The mayor of LeClaire was there, and his wife was there,' Bird said, recalling the scene at the coffee shop. Price was executive director of the Iowa Democratic Party until a month ago. Clinton's team tapped him last week to be its political director in Iowa. He did not respond to a request for comment. Bird is a government and community relations coordinator at Genesis Health System in Davenport, Iowa, according to his LinkedIn profile. A coworker at Genesis said Wednesday that Bird is 'basically a lobbyist in training. That's what he wants to do.' Bird disagreed, saying his role was 'more public relations.' He's also an outspoken progressive whose Facebook wall shows he ordered a 'Hillary For President' bumper sticker\u00a022 months ago. 'Is it 2016 yet?' he wrote in May 2013. Clinton's nascent campaign has carefully coordinated her image as a spontaneous, handshaking populist in her first days as a candidate, posing with Pennsylvanians at a gas station and venturing into an Ohio Chipotle restaurant for lunch. When no one recognized the former first lady \u2013 she was wearing sunglasses \u2013 the campaign leaked information to The New York Times so its reporters could get security-camera footage to prove she had tried to mingle with voters. Scripting supposedly off-the-cuff appearances is common in presidential politics but could hurt Clinton especially hard since her gonzo road-trip journey to America's broad midwest is designed to counter her image as cold, calculating and politically venomous. And planting party insiders in place of typical Iowans won't go over well in the Hawkeye State, where pressing the flesh and collecting caucus votes is a quadrennial full-contact sport. ASTROTURF: Setting up faux events for news cameras is nothing new in politics, but Iowans take presidential contests seriously and could punish Clinton for the deception . THE FIXER: Bird said Troy Prince (left, pictured with VP Joe Biden), who was executive director of the Iowa Democratic Party until he left last month to help Clinton's statewide political effort, recruited him and others to attend the 'spontaneous' coffee meeting . Clinton's campaign has already taken heat for depicting at least three people in her campaign launch video as 'everyday' Americans who were actually partisans with political connections. One was even a former campaign manager for Wendy Davis, the Texas Democrat who mounted a failed bid for Texas governor last year. In LeClaire on Tuesday,\u00a0Bloomberg and other outlets referred to Bird as a 'student' at St. Ambrose University, not as a hospital government-affairs staffer with Democratic party street-cred. He does study at St. Ambrose \u2013 part-time. But Bird's ties to the party are deep enough that his Facebook wall includes a photo of him standing in front of Joe Biden's limousine in Davenport. 'I was driving the Vice President when he was in town in October,' Bird noted in a Facebook comment. Biden was not there on official government business, but for a campaign stop in support of Democrat Bruce Braley. 'The Vice President will attend a grassroots event for Braley for Iowa with Representative David Loebsack,' according to White House press guidance for his October 27, 2014 schedule.", "reference": "Austin Bird\u00a0sat for coffee on Tuesday morning in the town of LeClaire, Iowa, chatting with Hillary Clinton as photographers snapped pictures .\nNews reports called him a 'student' and her campaign called it an unscripted event .\nBut Clinton's Iowa political director Troy Price drove Bird and two other people to the coffee house .\nBird is a hospital government relations official who interned with Barack Obama's 2012 presidential campaign .\nThe Iowa Democratic Party, which Price ran until a month ago,\u00a0tasked him to be Joe Biden's driver during an October Senate campaign trip in Davenport ."}, "75": {"id": "8e206658bea6ad126c247474babd5a7a01817d8d", "article": "One Wall Street trader closed out his week a few million dollars richer last Friday - and it was all thanks to social media. The unnamed trader used perfect timing to capitalize on one of the biggest deals of the year when Wall Street Journal mergers and acquisitions reporter Dana Mattioli took to Twitter to announce that Intel was in talks to buy one of its competitors, chipmaker Altera. Seconds later, the trader had snapped up 3,158 contracts of Altera, with each option contract giving them the right to purchase 100 shares. Scroll down for video . An unnamed Wall Street trader made a profit of approximately $2.5million on Friday thanks to a tweet from the Wall Street Journal . The trader purchased 315,800 shares of chipmaker Altera one minute after the Journal reported Intel was in talks to purchase them . CNBC reports that the trader paid $36 a share, and the call option was a mere 35 cents as options on the stock, at that point valued at $34.76 a share, were set to expire in just a few weeks. 3:32pm: The Wall Street Journal reports that Intel is in talks to buy Altera. 3:33pm: Trader purchases 315,800 shares of Altera at $36 a share for a total cost of $11,368,000 plus $110,530 for a $0.35 call option. 3:35pm: Nasdaq suspends trading of Altera in the wake of the Journal's tweet. 4:00pm: Trader sells Altera at the new share price of $44.39 for a total of $14,018,362. This, after factoring in the intital share price and call option, leaves them with a profit of approximately $2,539.832. This call option allowed the trader the right to purchase more shares in the company, in this case 315,800 shares, at the cost of $36, even though the value of shares quickly began to rise. Just 28 minutes later, when the market closed for the day, Altera was valued at\u00a0$44.39 per share. That was an increase of 28%, but because of the call option, the trader was able to sell their stocks at a far greater profit. So instead of making a 28% profit, the trader made a 2,220% profit of roughly $2.5million when they sold their shares. Even more impressive is that the trader managed to make the purchase just minutes before Nasdaq suspended trading of Altera because of the tweet from Mattioli. What's more, call options for Altera had at that point reached a price of $8.10 by the end of the day. There is also a chance, reports Matt Khouw, that the trader could have been aware of Intel's plan to buy Altera early, or that they used a bot to quickly buy the shares. 'A bot is not as outlandish as it sounds,' Khouw said. 'Traders need to aggregate and filter through tremendous amounts of data quickly and will rely on technology to help if it is available.' As for Intel's reported purchase of Altera, that still has yet to happen.

Mrs Cameron met Mitchell, aged four, at the Abbey Court School in Rainham, a special school \u00a0for three to 19-year-olds . She also spoke to five-year-old Jessica at the school, which aides said was 'very close to her heart' Mrs Cameron's first solo appearance three days into the campaign will be seen as a statement of intent from the Conservatives, who are desperate to wrest the seat back from Ukip following the by-election. Visiting a special school in the constituency, she joked that she was pleased that her campaigning duties did not stretch to a live TV debate. Mr Cameron is due to go head-to-head in a seven-way debate tomorrow night with the leaders of Labour, Lib Dems, Ukip, Greens, SNP and Plaid Cymru. Mrs Cameron told reporters: 'He doesn't seem too nervous but I'm very glad it's him doing it and not me.' When Mr Reckless defected from the Tories last year, the Prime Minister launched an extraordinary attack on his betrayal. Mr Cameron argued that committed volunteers have \u2018knocked on doors, stuffed envelopes, licked stamps to get his fat arse on the Commons benches, and this is how he repays them\u2019. But after the Conservatives threw the kitchen sink at the by-election triggered by his decision to join Ukip, Mr Reckless\u00a0held it with a majority of 2,920.

Mark Reckless defected from the Tories to Ukip last summer. After the Conservatives threw the kitchen sink at the subsequent by-election, Mr Reckless held it with a majority of 2,920 . In September, Mr Reckless followed Douglas Carswell to become the second Conservative to defect to Ukip. The turncoat MP was unrepentant about his defection, insisting the Tories had broken promises on immigration and reducing the deficit.

As it turned out, the emergency glass needed to be broken. The \u00a332million striker was required to stop Chelsea squandering the opportunity to open a seven-point advantage over their title rivals. Yet all they got was 11 minutes before Costa was forced off with a recurrence of the hamstring injury that ruled him out of the international break with Spain. Chelsea striker Diego Costa limped off with a hamstring injury shortly after coming on at the interval . Will he be out for a week, a month, two months, maybe more? \u2018It\u2019s too early,\u2019 said Mourinho, who went on to defend throwing Costa on. \u2018I don\u2019t say \u201cgamble\u201d because we did every test, every scan, the player trained for two days, he was 100 per cent with the team. \u2018The medical department were convinced he was ready. The player was convinced he was ready. Not for 90 minutes but he was ready to play and to help the team.\u2019 In the meantime a chunk of the Chelsea contingent will be wondering how they fill the void left by Costa. They need look no further than this win against Stoke as the answer presents itself in the form of Loic Remy and, of course, Eden Hazard. Blues striker Costa looks despondent as he sits on the turf following another injury to his hamstring . Hazard scored and assisted in the same Premier League match for the seventh time, and looked like a man ready to rubbish the idea he was too tired to play a full 90 minutes for Belgium in midweek. He tormented the Stoke defence here at Stamford Bridge, and has scored more Premier League goals for Chelsea over the past three seasons than any other player. That\u2019s 35, by the way. So, too, was Remy equally as clinical against Stoke. Acting as Costa\u2019s replacement for the starting XI, he proved more than a handful for the visitors on his fourth start for Chelsea in the Premier League. It took an outstanding one-handed save from Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic at full stretch to deny Remy\u2019s deflected shot from giving Chelsea the lead after just three minutes. Then, four minutes later, it was him again, going close as his curled shot skipped agonisingly wide of the far post. The man turned down by Liverpool was given the unfortunate task of trying to fill the boots of Costa, but rarely looked shy in doing so. Yet it remained 0-0 as half time approached. Was it time for Mourinho to roll the dice? It was in the 32nd minute his patience wore thin. Costa looks in pain after pulling up at Stamford Bridge during Chelsea's 2-1 win over Stoke City . Chelsea gave away possession in the final third \u2013 not for the first time \u2013 and a frowning Mourinho turned to his substitutes\u2019 bench, gestured at Costa with a nod, and the striker began warming up down the touchline. A sign he was to be introduced soon enough. It took a smidgen of luck for the deadlock to be broken thanks to the quick feet of Cesc Fabregas earning a penalty, and Hazard was cool as ever in putting Chelsea ahead. Never in doubt, as no player in Premier League history has taken more and never missed than Hazard. Yet Stamford Bridge\u2019s celebrations were short-lived. Mourinho\u2019s frustration grew when Charlie Adam channelled his inner David Beckham and scored from more than 60 yards out. With Thibaut Courtois left embarrassed, Mourinho knew it was time to \u2018gamble\u2019. Jose Mourinho was happy to have gambled with Costa's fitness despite losing the striker after 10 minutes . Off went Oscar, on came Costa for the second half. No sooner had he been on the pitch than he had to come off. He signalled to the bench after just 10 minutes and was replaced by veteran Didier Drogba. Yet this was all about Chelsea's go-to guy, Hazard, and Costa\u2019s worthy replacement, Remy. \u2018We have three strikers,\u2019 Mourinho declared afterwards. \u2018We decided at the beginning of the season to go more with Diego. He won the right of being first choice.\u2019 But by this evidence, Chelsea supporters need not lose sleep over their first-choice striker's injury. As Stoke found out, Remy can fill the gap left by Costa, and Hazard is simply every bit a Premier League title winner in the making.

Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, a top leader of the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba, was released early Friday from a jail in the Pakistani city of Rawalpindi, according to Yahya Mujahid, spokesman for Jamaat-ud-Dawa, a group with which Lakhvi is affiliated. Lakhvi was charged in Pakistan in 2009, accused of masterminding the November 2008 terror attacks that left more than 160 people dead in Mumbai, India's most populous city. Lakhvi still faces trial in the case. But an anti-terrorism court granted Lakhvi bail last year, a decision the Pakistani government said it would challenge. That challenge lasted until Thursday, when the Lahore High Court ordered his release, CNN affiliate and Pakistani outlet GEO News reported. Lakhvi posted bail totaling 2 million Pakistani rupees (more than $19,000), according to GEO News. India, Pakistan's neighbor and rival, condemned Lakhvi's bail release on Friday. The country contacted Pakistan's foreign secretary to underline \"that this has reinforced the perception that Pakistan has a dual policy on dealing with terrorists, and those who have carried out attacks or are posing a threat to India are being dealt with differently,\" said Syed Akbaruddin, a spokesman for India's Ministry of External Affairs. The accusation that Pakistan might treat India differently highlights long-running tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, which have fought three wars against each other since their partition at the end of British colonial rule. Pakistan's Foreign Office responded Friday by saying, \"It would not be proper to cast aspersions on Pakistan's commitment to countering terrorism at a time when Pakistan has entered a critical stage of defeating the menace of terrorism.\" The Foreign Office also blamed what it said was India's delay in cooperating in the case, saying it \"weakened the prosecution.\" In the Mumbai attacks, heavily armed men stormed landmark buildings around Mumbai, including luxury hotels, the city's historic Victoria Terminus train station and a Jewish cultural center. India executed the last surviving gunman from the attacks in 2012. Other suspects were all killed during the series of attacks, which went on for three days. More about the Mumbai attacks .

The Nordic country decided to tighten up its laws amid reports of animal sex shows, clubs and even animal brothels frequented by tourists taking advantage of its lax regulations.

New law: The Danish government bought in tougher legislation amid fears their relaxed legal stance on bestiality was making the country a destination for people who wanted to have sex with animals .

Greenblatt-Seay used a drone to film this cinematic overhead shot at Hummel Park in Omaha, Nebraska . The video begins from far overhead, showcasing the silver car as just a speck among the vast expanse of trees at Hummel Park in Omaha, Nebraska. Greenblatt-Seay used his drone, a DJI Inspire 1 model, to capture the cinematic effect before dramatically zooming in on the car's tires, headlights, dashboard and seats like a classic car commercial. Perhaps the best effect of the ad is that it is soundtracked with an old-fashioned 1987 Ford Taurus commercial.

Szczesny has found himself demoted to the substitutes' bench in recent months due to a combination of poor performances and the form of David Ospina since the new year. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger has benefited from competition for places brought by the \u00a33.2 million signing of Colombian Ospina from Nice last summer, as eight consecutive wins have lifted his side to second in the Premier League. Wojciech Szczesny hasn't played a Premier League game since the 2-0 defeat to Southampton in January . David Ospina boasts the highest win ratio of any Premier League player to make more than 10 appearances . Szczesny is expected to line up in goal for Arsenal in Saturday's FA Cup semi-final against Reading at Wembley, and Seaman believes the Poland international can make the number one jersey his own once more. 'With Wojciech, it must be hard for him now to be number two, coming off the back of a season where he was a regular and had been playing at his best, but it is totally just because he had a couple of bad mistakes and Ospina has gone in and done his stuff,' Seaman said. 'Either of them could be Arsenal's number one, it is about who is on form - and if Ospina keeps his form, then he is going to stay there.' Former Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman was speaking as an ambassador for the 'Know the Score' campaign against bowel cancer to Press Association Sport. Szczesny compounded his indifferent on-field performances by being caught smoking in the showers after defeat at Southampton on New Year's Day - the last time the 24-year-old started a league game for the North Londoners. But Seaman has every faith in the 6ft 5in deposed keeper, believing that if Szczesny takes the positives from a spell on the sidelines, he can emerge a far better goalkeeper in the years to come. The 51-year-old continued: 'It is not a difficult situation, but it keeps you on your toes to know that there is quality behind you. 'It is not just the games which make you play better, it is the training. 'The goalkeepers train together, and you see the other guy, you think \"I want to be better than him\" or \"I am going to show him how good I am\". That is day to day and is good because it brings the best out of you and tests you, so you become a better goalkeeper.' David Seaman is a former English goalkeeper who joined Arsenal from Queens Park Rangers in 1990 for \u00a31.3m, a then British record transfer fee for a goalkeeper. He spent 13 seasons at the Gunners, winning the old First Division Championship and the Premier League twice. Seaman also won four FA Cups, a League Cup and the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup during his time at Highbury. In all, he\u00a0made 564 appearances for the Gunners between 1990 and 2003, before joining Manchester City on a free transfer. A return of 11 wins from 12 starts has turned Ospina into a fans' favourite at the Emirates, but Seaman is only too aware of how quickly things can change in football, and has urged Szczesny to think carefully before making a decision on his future. 'Wojciech has a big choice now, but he has still got loads of time, I did not join Arsenal until I was 26,' said Seaman, who left Arsenal for Manchester City in 2003 after leading the Gunners to FA Cup glory over Southampton at the Millennium Stadium. 'It is about how he reacts, and what does the player want - does he want to play as a number one? Or is he happy being at a big club as a number two? 'It is all about his ambition. If he wants to be a number one somewhere, then how long is he going to have to wait? 'But if he leaves Arsenal, then it won't be the same level, because it is not until after they go, that all these guys realise how good Arsenal is.' When did Ospina join Arsenal? Arsenal signed Ospina from Ligue 1 side Nice last summer. The 26-year-old made close to 200 appearances for the French club during six seasons. How much did Arsenal pay for him? Originally signed as back-up and competition for Wojciech Szczesny after the Gunners No 2 Lukasz Fabianski joined Swansea, Ospina cost a paltry \u00a33million. Is he of international calibre? Ospina had won 52 caps for Colombia and impressed during their run to the World Cup quarter-final in Brazil last summer. When did Ospina make his first appearance for Arsenal? Ospina made his debut for Arsenal in a 2-1 defeat by Southampton in the third round of the\u00a0Capital\u00a0One\u00a0Cup back in September and only made one further appearance in the Champions League before 2015. When did he displace\u00a0Wojciech Szczesny as No 1? Ospina was recalled to the starting line-up as Arsenal beat Hull 2-0 in the FA Cup third round in January after Szczesny was at fault for both goals during a 2-0 defeat by Southampton. It later emerged that the Poland goalkeeper was caught smoking in the showers after the game. Ospina kept his place for the league game the following week and has played every Premier League match since. Did you know...

Many firemen have not been trained in basic first aid \u2013 yet they are being left to care for seriously ill elderly patients for hours while they wait for an ambulance. The Fire Brigades Union say the practice is irresponsible and dangerous but is becoming increasingly common because the ambulance service is so overstretched. The ambulance service is becoming increasingly reliant on firemen to attend life-threatening emergencies . The Fire Brigade Union say the practice is irresponsible and dangerous and becoming more common . Senior union officials say fire engines are routinely being turned into makeshift ambulances to ferry patients to A&E. They normally carry a few blankets, oxygen masks to protect against smokes and a defibrillator \u2013 to restart the heart. In one case earlier this year an elderly lady is feared to have died because she was left in the hands of fire crews for nearly 40 minutes while paramedics were delayed. The ambulance service is facing unprecedented demand from the rising and aging population and in some areas 999 calls are up by 15 per cent on last year. Paramedics are also having to respond to rising numbers of non-urgent calls from patients frustrated that they cannot get an appointment with their GP. They are also having to waste much of their time queued up outside A&E units which cannot accept their patients because staff there are also very busy. This has all led to the ambulance service increasingly relying on firemen to attend potentially life-threatening emergencies. The Fire Brigades Union yesterday warned that South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue were sending firemen with no medical training to 999 calls instead of ambulances. It pointed out that only a third of firefighters at this branch had any medical training \u2013 and even this only consisted of a four day course of basic first aid. Yet in one case they were left to help an elderly lady who had stopped breathing for 45 minutes whilst they waited for the ambulance to arrive. Senior union officials say fire engines are routinely being turned into makeshift ambulances to ferry patients to A&E . In another, they tended to a pensioner who had fallen and banged her head for two hours before they were forced to leave her on her own \u2013 to attend a fire. The practice is occurring across the country and last July, firemen took a 16-year-old girl with suspected bleeding on the brain to A&E in Warrington, Cheshire . In December, crews were sent to a care home in Ryde on the Isle of Wight where an elderly woman had a stroke and were ordered to cut the rings off her fingers which were turning blue because of poor blood flow. Ian Murray, vice-president of the Fire Brigades Union \u2013 which represents 44,000 firemen \u2013 said: 'We know only a small percentage of firefighters are trained to give basic first aid. 'It is irresponsible and dangerous to put untrained firefighters in the position of attending incidents to assist the ambulance service, with the knowledge that it is highly unlikely one will arrive for some considerable time.'

While the Government is desperately trying to recruit more GPs, medical leaders warn the speciality has become unfashionable as junior doctors fear being overworked. The news comes amid a chronic shortage of doctors, and last week it was revealed that 10 per cent of patients tried - and failed - to book a GP appointment in 2013/14. Access to a GP is about to get even worse, as new figures show a third of GP training posts remain unfilled . This means patients tried and failed to book almost 34 million GP appointments last year. Each August, junior doctors with two years experience after medical school begin training as either a GP or a hospital doctor. This year, 29 per cent of GP trainee places remain unfilled, at a time when there is already a shortage of doctors. In some parts of the UK, more than 60 per cent of positions remain unfilled,\u00a0sparking fears patients may struggle to see their GP. The figures, from the GP National Recruitment office website, were disclosed in an investigation by Pulse magazine. Overall, they show that more than 1,000 GP training posts are vacant. In the East Midlands, 64 per cent of posts are unfilled, with 63 per cent vacancy rate in the North East of England. In the West Midlands 47 per cent of posts are empty and across the south Coast 41 per cent of places remain unfilled. In 2013, the last time figures are available, there was a vacancy rate for GP trainee posts of 8 per cent at the same point in the recruitment process. Of the 12 areas across the England, Scotland and Wales, only London managed to fill its vacancies in the first round of recruitment. Doctors warn the figures mean we may be headed for a recruitment crisis, as there is already a shortage of doctors in many parts of the country . Two other areas \u2013 Kent, Surrey & Sussex and Thames Valley are expected to do so in the next round of recruitment.

He said: 'Some practices are having to close their doors, others are reducing the level of service, because there just aren't enough doctors and ever more demands on them,' he said. He added junior doctors are opting to become hospital doctors instead of GPs as they fear they will be overburdened by work as a family doctor. The figures will be a blow Health Education England, the body responsible for GP recruitment, who had set a target to recruit 50 per cent of junior doctors to become GP trainees by 2016. They were already forced to push back their deadline for this target by a year, after applications for GP training fell in 2014.

'It got to the point where I didn't feel comfortable unless I was wearing a new pair. 'But, eventually, my money started to run out and I had to buy budget ones instead.

He said his bizarre habit began after the breakdown of a relationship. 'Crisp pair': During his year-long addiction, Mr Almond bought some 365 pairs of new boxers - and threw most pairs into the bin after just one wear . Whenever they stayed over, they would wear the same underwear for several days running, which he thought was 'disgusting'. So, in a bid to get over his former partner, Mr Almond started wearing a fresh pair every day. He also moved back in with his mother, meaning he had extra money to spend on his obsession. He said: 'I did all my own washing and that meant that my mum never found out about my addiction to clean boxers. 'Luckily she never looked through my bin - it was full of boxers that I had only worn for one day at a time and then just thrown away.

Mr Almond eventually began feeling the squeeze when his mother increased his rent by \u00a3100. But, as his budget grew tighter, he simply reverted to budget boxers instead. 'At Christmas, when the shops changed their stock, I had no choice but to buy loads of boxers that had 'jingle balls' printed on them,' he said. But Mr Almond was again forced to rethink his lifestyle when he  received a hefty insurance bill through the post. He said: 'All of my savings had to go on paying my insurance.

'I can't stop': Chanel (L) picks up the blood from a local butcher . Chanel insists that, despite her young age, she is already starting to show signs of aging, which she is convinced will soon put a stop to her modeling career altogether. Her desperation to remain looking as young as possible for as long as possible has driven Chanel to a number of extraordinary lengths, most notably covering her body in animal blood , a process she insists will 'keep the skin looking soft and tight'. Her family, skeptical of the benefits ask for proof, but Chanel is unable to offer anything which backs up her bizarre claims. The model also shows off a myriad of other 'beauty fixes' she uses, including a daily shot of garlic powder, balsamic vinaigrette, sage, and olive oil - which she claims helps to 'preserve your body' - as well as a skincare regimen that involves washing her face eight to ten times per day. She also claims to have eaten\u00a0placenta, gone on fasts and put her body through many detoxes in her\u00a0quest to stay young.

The model, who claims to be a vegetarian, describes how 'even the roughest parts of the body like the elbows feel soft, and I think I owe that to the blood'. Later in the episode, Chanel claims that though she believes the blood bath helped her self-esteem, she 'has no desire to do it again'. Luckily for Chanel, the experience of filming with MTV seems to have had a positive outcome. As she reveals in a follow up Q&A with the channel, she was 'humbled' by the reactions she received.

The former Premier League defender said he had 'moved out of the marital home' in Yorkshire that he shared with his wife of 14 years, Gemma. Mr Carlisle tried to kill himself in December, two days after he was arrested on suspicion of drink-driving. Scroll down for video . Split:\u00a0Clarke Carlisle says he has 'moved out of the marital home' in Yorkshire that he shared with his wife of 14 years, Gemma. The pair are pictured together in 2013 . The 35-year-old father-of-three stepped in front of a 12-ton truck on the A64 near York in December, suffering cuts, bruises, internal bleeding, a broken rib and a shattered left knee. The incident has left the ex-Burnley defender with scars all over his body. On television this week Mr Carlisle, who has publicly struggled with depression, revealed the scars he still bears from his suicide attempt are a 'constant reminder' of his good fortune in surviving. Now Mr Carlisle, who played 131 times for the Clarets between 2007 and 2012, said the accident had led to him moving out of the house he shared with wife Gemma. The sportsman, dubbed 'Britain's brainiest footballer' after he appeared on Countdown in 2002,\u00a0told TalkSport Radio on a special Monday night show: 'At this point, Gemma and I have separated. 'I have moved out of the marital home because I have to focus on my well-being and equally as much Gemma has to do the same. 'She has to deal with her experiences and the effect that has had on her.' Mr Carlisle appeared on Good Morning Britain this week and revealed the scars he still bears from his suicide attempt are a 'constant reminder' of his good fortune in surviving . Asked about how his wife Gemma has taken it, he added: 'Every day has been incredibly tough and different. 'When you have been with someone for 14 years but masking things and thoughts from her, it was because I was a people-pleaser. 'I've desperately wanted to say what I know will make her happy and do the things that I think she wants me to do - instead of being myself.' Earlier this week Mr Carlisle apologised to the driver of the lorry which he jumped in front of in an attempt to kill himself. The former footballer said that he prays for the driver, Darren Pease, every day - but added that he has been unable to apologise in person because the haulier refuses to meet him. Star: Mr Carlisle pictured playing for Burnley against Aston Villa in 2010, at the peak of his footballing career . Appearing on ITV's Good Morning Britain on Tuesday, Mr Carlisle said he was 'so sorry' for putting Mr Pease through the ordeal of being involved in a near-fatal crash. Speaking earlier this month, Mr Pease, 53, said that he might never be able to drive a lorry again after hitting Mr Carlisle. Mr Carlisle played for nine different clubs in his 16-year career, including five years at Burnley, and served as chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association. Last week, he pleaded guilty to failing to provide a sample when he was stopped by police in December as his car was swerving around the road. He will be sentenced in May.

The 50-year-old needs just two more wins to achieve the fourth promotion of a career that has been mostly spent rescuing clubs from relegation after goals by Kieran Agard, Joe Bryan and Aaron Wilbraham clinched a local derby victory. In front of a sold-out Ashton Gate, City took revenge for a bitterly fought 1-0 defeat back in November which ended their unbeaten start to the season.

But it was the City boss who had the last laugh with a victory that left Swindon boss Mark Cooper having to pick his side up from two 3-0 defeats in four days that have finished their last hope of automatic promotion. Just to add to their woes they had both Yaser Kasim and Raphael Branco booked, meaning both will now serve suspensions. City had actually needed to ride their luck for much of the first half, with goalkeeper Frank Fielding pulling off three saves in two frantic minutes at one point. And Swindon striker Andy Williams cost Cooper's side their best chance of going in front when he cashed in on a mistake by Aden Flint to go through. He should have squared the ball back to strike partner Michael Smith who couldn' t have missed but instead tried to go it alone and gave Fielding the chance to save.

Ben Gladwin (left) brings the ball for Swindon as Bristol City's Joe Bryan (centre) gives chace in midfield . As if that miss wasn't frustrating enough for the visitors, they were then architects of their own downfall when City took the lead on 35 minutes. Yaser Kasim was put under pressure as Swindon tried to play the ball out from the back from a goal kick, and gave it away to Joe Bryan. The young wing back hit a perfect pass to send Agard clear to make no mistake with his 11th goal of the season. City had earned that goal for the way they worked to put pressure on defenders, and they made their own luck again when Derrick Williams stretched to divert Ben Gladwin's shot onto the underside of the bar. Swindon's strike partnership of Williams and Smith had shared 36 goals and it wasn't hard to see why as their movement constantly troubled City's defence. But Williams, who had 21 of them, couldn't quite find his shooting range and put another gilt edged opportunity over the bar just after half time when Massimo Luongo had sent him clear. But that summed up the story of the night with no end product to so much possession, and the game swung back City's way when Jordan Turnbull turned Bryan's cross onto the top of his own bar. With 11 minutes gone Bryan wriggled into some space on the edge of the box, put the ball onto his left foot, and beat Wes Foderingham with a perfectly placed shot into the top corner. And the win was wrapped up when Luke Freeman reached the byline and cut the ball back for skipper Wilbraham to fire home his 19th of the season.

The fund had been facing allegations of improper behavior after reports surfaced about undisclosed donations from foreign governments and a donor who was selling his uranium company to a Russian state agency at the same time the State Department had to approve the sale. Acting CEO Maura Pally defended the foundation's work and reaffirmed its commitment to transparency, describing its policies on donor disclosure and contributions from foreign governments as 'stronger than ever.' However, the tempered apology came the same day that a government watchdog said that the charity seemed like a 'slush fund' for one of America's most powerful political families. The acting CEO of the Clinton Foundation apologized after Hillary Clinton's presidential candidacy put it under intense scrutiny for undisclosed donations. Above, Clinton speaks at a foundation event in December . Maura Pally (left) said that money received from a businessman when he was seeking State Department approval for selling his company to Russia (right) could not be disclosed under Canadian law . Pally said the foundation expected to refile some of its tax forms, following a voluntary external review, because it had 'mistakenly combined' government grants and donations. She said the foundation would 'remedy' any errors but stressed the total revenue was reported accurately and that grants were properly broken out on audited statements on its website. 'Yes, we made mistakes, as many organizations of our size do, but we are acting quickly to remedy them, and have taken steps to ensure they don't happen in the future,' she said. Pally also described the foundation's work with the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership, which she said received funding from a separate organization in Canada. The partnership received more than $2million in donations from the Canadian chairman of Uranium One, Ian Telfer, when it was being sold to Russian state atomic agency Rosatom. Telfer's donations, given by his own foundation, came at the same time as the State Department, then headed by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, helped approve the sale. The transaction, which followed Bill Clinton helping businessman Frank Giustra secure some of the Kazakh uranium sites also being sold, needed to be vetted by a government committee because it gave one-fifth of US uranium production into foreign hands. Pally's blog post said that the Giustra partnership does not disclose its donors because under Canadian law they are not disclosed without prior permission from each donor. 'This is hardly an effort on our part to avoid transparency,' she said. The apology said that Uranium One Chairman Ian Telfer's donations to a foundation partnership with Frank Giustra (right) would have needed prior permission to be disclosed. Above, Giustra and Bill Clinton . A non-profit rating agency has placed the Clinton Foundation on a watch list. Above, the New York Times's David Leonhardt (left), philanthropist Melinda Gates (center) and Hillary Clinton . Despite the apology, a fellow at the nonpartisan government watchdog Sunlight Foundation questioned the foundation and the Clintons' association with it, according to the New York Post. 'It seems like the Clinton Foundation operates as a slush fund for the Clintons,' Sunlight's Bill Allison said. The Clinton Foundation is said to have taken more than $140million in grants and pledges in 2013, spending\u00a0$84.6 million on 'functional expenses' including payroll and just $9million on direct aid. The foundation, which was also placed on a watch list by the non-profit rating organization Charity Navigator, said that the excess money is in pledges rather than hard assets. Though the rating organization said it 'takes no position on allegations made or issues raised by third parties' it said on its website that it 'has determined that the nature of this/these issue(s) warrants highlighting the information available so that donors are aware of the issues in question'. Charity Navigator also refused to rate the foundation, citing insufficient methods to gauge its 'atypical business model'. Since announcing her run for president, Clinton has sought to dismiss questions about financial support of her family charity and allegations of undue influence as 'distractions and attacks' by Republicans seeking to discredit her. Pally said 'So yes, we made mistakes, as many organizations of our size do, but we are acting quickly to remedy them, and have taken steps to ensure they don't happen in the future'.

Having originally signed for Chelsea in 2004 for a fee of \u00a324million from Marseille, Drogba took time to forge his redoubtable status against Wenger, his first two appearances ending goalless. It was the 2005 Community Shield when he first put Arsenal to the sword, lashing two goals past Jens Lehmann in a 2-1 victory at the Millennium Stadium before scoring the decisive goal in a 1-0 victory in the Premier League three weeks later. In 2007, Drogba overturned the one-goal advantage Arsenal had in the 2007 League Cup final through Theo Walcott with another brace, again in Wales. And Drogba's third double against Arsenal was in similar circumstances on March 23, 2008. Bacary Sagna gave The Gunners the lead before Drogba struck twice in nine minutes at Stamford Bridge. The 2009 FA Cup semi-final allowed Drogba to break Arsenal's hearts again with silverware in sight, this time at Wembley. Like the 2007 League Cup final, Walcott put Arsenal ahead but Florent Malouda equalised before Drogba won the cup tie with a goal in the 84th minute. In the next two encounters between the London sides, Drogba netted a double in each game to lead Chelsea to a 3-0 and 2-0 victory respectively. On October 3 2010, he opened the scoring as Chelsea beat Arsenal 2-0 at Stamford Bridge which was his last goal against Arsenal in Chelsea colours.

Emwazi, who is originally from London, was planning on joining al-Shabaab in Africa but changed his mind after his friends were killed amid accusations they were set up by rival group members. Instead he travelled to Syria where he joined Islamic State and became synonymous with their gruesome beheading videos posted online. Scroll for video . Mohammed Emwazi (left), now known as masked killer Jihadi John (right), planned to join al-Shabaab in Somalia before going to Syria because two of his friends were killed, a source has said . According to a 29-year-old Syrian, named only as Ayman, Emwazi was obsessed with al-Shabaab and constantly spoke about the fighting in Somalia. In an interview with The Independent, Ayman says Emwazi once confided in him that he planned to join al-Shabaab before coming to Syria because Somalia was too dangerous. Ayman, who said he met Emwazi in Syria after ISIS captured his hometown, added: 'Mohammed was obsessed with al-Shabaab, he was angry about what happened in Africa. 'Some of his friends had been killed, some sent to prison and he thought they had been betrayed.' Emwazi became convinced al-Shabaab had been infiltrated by Western spies after friends Bilal al-Berjawi (pictured) and Mohammed Sakr were killed . The friends referred to are likely to be Bilal al-Berjawi and Mohammed Sakr, two members of the 'London Boys' gang of extremists that grew up with Emwazi in Maida Vale, north west London. Al-Berjawi passed through UK Border Control at least five times between 2006 and 2009 as he travelled between London and African terror cells, and helped to radicalise Emwazi while in the UK. Three years ago he was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Somalia, and according to Ayman, Emwazi was convinced that his location had been given to the Americans by fellow members of al-Shabaab during an internal power struggle. Emwazi also believed that another friend, Mohammed Sakr, who at one time had lived next door to al-Berjawi, was also betrayed to his death after he was killed in February 2012, also in Somalia. Emwazi has previously been accused of trying to join al-Shabaab, and was detained in August 2009 after flying to Tanzania in east Africa with a group of friends. They had claimed to be going on a wildlife safari, but were sent back to the Netherlands by security forced, where Emwazi later claimed he was questioned by an MI5 agent who tried to recruit him. Al-Berjawi and Sakr were also detained in Kenya around the same time, but later returned to Africa and were able to make it to Somalia, where they joined the fighting. Ayman claims that Emwazi also intended to return, but after his friends were killed he decided against it, believing al-Shabaab had been infiltrated by Western spies and was too dangerous. He added: 'Perhaps the British should be sorry they did not let him go to Somalia, he would probably be dead now like his friends.' In 2012, Emwazi fled Britain for Syria, despite being on terror watchlists, where he eventually joined the ranks of ISIS. Emwazi was accused of trying to join al-Shabaab in 2009 when he flew to Tanzania before being sent back home by security force. He joined ISIS in Syria in 2012 (pictured, al-Shabaab militants in Somalia) It is thought that during the early stages of the conflict Emwazi was a prison guard, along with three other Britons, leading to them being nicknamed The Beatles. Escaped captives had given him the name John, after Beatles lyricist John Lennon, which eventually became Jihadi John. In previous interviews, French hostages have described how Emwazi talked to them about al-Shabaab and the war in Somalia, making them watch videos of the fighting there. Emwazi first rose to international attention in August 2014 when he appeared in a video showing the beheading of American journalist James Foley. Since then he has been seen in videos showing the beheading of Steven Sotloff, another American journalist, Peter Kassig, a former U.S. solider. Also murdered at the hands of Emwazi were David Haines and Alan Henning, two British aid workers, and Japanese hostages Kenji Goto and Haruna Yakuwa.", "reference": "Mohammed Emwazi wanted to join al-Shabaab in Somalia, source claims .\nStopped in 2009 after flying to Africa and was put on flight back home .\nSource claims he intended to go back, but did not after friends were killed .\nBilal al-Berjawi and Mohammed Sakr died\u00a0during\u00a0drone strikes in 2012 .\nThe same year Emwazi travelled to Syria where he joined Islamic State ."}, "104": {"id": "5f4fcacd7e634fc9d49d96e1012ece864a18bfe7", "article": "It looks like a clumsy bottle top, or maybe the missing part of a child\u2019s toy.

Critics have expressed alarm at the move, with Human Rights Watch's Asia director Brad Adams saying it marked the country's \"deepening descent into dictatorship.\" Martial law was lifted Wednesday when the Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej approved a request from Prime Minister General Prayuth Chan-ocha to proceed. Prayuth -- head of the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) junta -- immediately invoked Article 44 of the country's interim constitution \"to curb acts deemed harmful to national peace and stability.\" Article 44 states, in wide-ranging terms, that when the head of the junta believes it is necessary in the name of public harmony or to prevent the undermining of national security, then he has the power to act as deemed necessary. According to a statement issued by the NCPO, the new order grants military personnel powers to issue summons and arrest those who commit crimes against the royal family or against national stability, who commit crimes involving war weaponry, or who violate the orders of the NCPO. Designated military personnel were granted powers to seize assets, to block media from reporting or publishing, and to detain suspects up to seven days, the statement said. Unauthorized political gatherings of more than five people were banned, while those who defied NCPO orders could be imprisoned for up to a year, it said. Those who were detained could not leave the country without the approval of the head of the NCPO. Human Rights Watch said in a statement that the new security order would allow Prayuth \"to issue orders without administrative, legislative, or judicial oversight or accountability.\" \"Thailand's friends abroad should not be fooled by this obvious sleight of hand by the junta leader to replace martial law with a constitutional provision that effectively provides unlimited and unaccountable powers,\" Adams said in a statement. Sunai Phasuk, Human Rights Watch's senior researcher on Thailand, told CNN the move would see Prayuth \"become a strongman with ultimate power in his hands to wield as he wishes.\" \"This is a dangerous indication that the junta is not going to keep its promise to restore democracy and respect for human rights in Thailand,\" he said. Rupert Abbott, deputy director for Asia Pacific at Amnesty International, called in a statement for the NCPO to \"reinstate the rule of law and constitutional protections for human rights which the 2014 coup steamrolled over.\" Meanwhile, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein expressed alarm at the news. \"Normally I would warmly welcome the lifting of martial law -- and indeed strongly advocated for it to be lifted in Thailand,\" the High Commissioner said. \"But I am alarmed at the decision to replace martial law with something even more draconian, which bestows unlimited powers on the current Prime Minister without any judicial oversight at all. This clearly leaves the door wide open to serious violations of fundamental human rights.\" Martial law was imposed shortly before Thailand's military seized power last May, ousting the democratically-elected government of Yingluck Shinawatra after months of sometimes violent street protests. Since then, the NCPO has curbed civil liberties, muzzled the media and rounded up opponents. Amnesty International says that since May, hundreds of people have been arbitrarily held and dozens brought before military courts for engaging in peaceful political gatherings or expression. Thai political scholar and coup opponent Pavin Chachavalpongpun told CNN that the move from martial law to the new security order amounted to \"pouring the same wine into a new bottle.\" \"The junta is trying to reinvent itself, but the substance is still there,\" he said. \"In a word: it's absurd. Everyone knows in Thailand they had to abolish the martial law because of international pressure. \"But Article 44 is a lot worse than the martial law because it gives total power to the NCPO.\" Thailand's military rulers have insisted that such restrictive measures are needed to maintain stability, following a decade of political conflict which has pitted a royalist, middle-class Bangkok elite against Shinawatra's supporters, mostly drawn from the urban working class or the rural north. But Pavin did not believe there was a sufficient threat to national security to justify the new order. \"The notion of national security has been exploited over and over,\" he said. A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok said it was important that Thai citizens were allowed \"to freely exercise their fundamental rights, including the rights of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.\"", "reference": "Martial law has been lifted in Thailand after 10 months .\nIt has been replaced by a new order granting sweeping powers to the military junta .\nCritics warn the move deepens the country's \"descent into dictatorship\""}, "107": {"id": "5d062da8b49aaf8565592c7302e5f927242dc645", "article": "Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge was left in stitches by an impersonation of club legend Michael Owen. Ahead of the Reds' FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa at Wembley on Sunday, the England international met up with comedian Darren Farley as part of an exclusive promotional video to showcase the TV coverage of the match by BT Sport. Farley, who first rose to prominence on YouTube, specialises in mimicking a number of Anfield stars both past and present. Daniel Sturridge cannot stop laughing after hearing Darren Farley's impression of Michael Owen . Owen, now a BT Sport pundit, played for Liverpool between 1996 and 2004, scoring 118 league goals . His hauntingly accurate of portrayal of Owen was certainly one of his best performances and had Sturridge gasping for breath. Between the giggles, the pair discussed the fascinating clash with Villa and Sturridge's trademark goal celebration dance. However, while Farley's Owen impression was certainly on point, his dancing left a lot to be desired. Sturridge is a major doubt to feature in the game with Villa, facing a late battle to overcome a hip injury. Villa, meanwhile, have their own concerns with winger Gabriel Agbonlahor rated 'touch and go' in relation to a hamstring strain, while midfielder Carlos Sanchez is suspended.

Denver Broncos cornerback\u00a0Aqib Talib and his brother are being investigated for aggravated assault after an altercation at a Dallas-area nightclub on Wednesday morning, according to reports. During a 2011 incident involving two guns when he playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Talib and his mother were accused of shooting a gun at his sister's live-in boyfriend in Garland, Texas. Denver Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib and his brother Yaqub are being investigated for aggravated assault . Talib was in trouble before and was wanted on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in 2011 . During the latest incident, a shot was fired outside of Club Luxx in Dallas, Texas, after a physical fight inside . During the incident on Wednesday, Talib and his brother Yaqub had a physical altercation with someone inside Club Luxx and then a shot was fired outside around 2am,\u00a0WFAA reported. When Dallas officers responded to the active shooter call, the man who called police said three black men had been involved in a disturbance and one of them had tried to punch him. The man also said one of the men pulled out a gun and aimed it at him before firing a round off into the sky outside the bar and causing 'an immediate panic'. The Talibs left the area in a Range Rover and a Jaguar and went to the XTC Cabaret. Police found the brothers at the second club and impounded the vehicles to look for evidence. The brothers were both questioned and an investigation into the incident is ongoing. The general manager of Club Luxx, confirmed the Talibs were at the club but denied that anything with a gun transpired, the\u00a0Dallas Morning News reported. Hanney Kamal said: 'One-hundred percent that did not happen. 'I was there. Somebody might have called the police because there was a yelling argument. Talib signed a six-year, $57 million contract last year . 'It's athletes \u2014 someone sees them yelling and dials 911. 'Everyone was asked to leave the club, which they did of their own free will, and that was it.' Broncos vice president of public relations Patrick Smyth said: 'We have been in touch with Aqib regarding these reports and will continue to monitor this situation.' Dallas police falsely reported Talib had been arrested for throwing bottles last June during an NFL camp afterparty, the\u00a0Denver Post\u00a0reported. The police apologized after it ended up being Yaqub who was arrested. During the 2011 incident in Garland, felony warrants were issued for Talib and his mother Okolo Talib on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Police suspected them both of firing shots from a Ruger .380 handgun at\u00a0Shannon Billings, the boyfriend of Talib's sister, and also believed the NFL back\u00a0attempted to pistol-whip Billings with a Springfield 9mm semiautomatic handgun during the incident, the Boston Globe\u00a0reported. They had apparently learned Billings was being physically abusive towards their family member. Talib, who owned both weapons. reportedly yelled during the pistol-whipping: 'You're going to make me throw away my career.' The charges were dropped because prosecutors believed Billings, a registered sex offender with the state of Texas, would not make a credible witness. Garland Police spokesman Joe Harn said: 'It was very fortunate no one was killed and no one was hurt seriously. 'There wasn't a great deal of distance from one person to the other that was shooting.' After the 2011 incident, a felony warrant was issued for  Okolo Talib for an assault with a deadly weapon charge . In addition to playing for the Broncos, Talib has also played for the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Bucs . In addition to the gun incidents, Talib was investigated after an alleged assault on a Florida cab driver. He then resisted arrest on charges of simple battery. The shutdown corner also fought with teammates and was suspended for violating the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing substances. Talib signed a six-year, $57 million contract with Denver in March 2014. He also has played for the New England Patriots during his seven-year career. During his time with the reigning Super Bowl champs, Talib said: 'I'm a competitor on the field, man. 'That's kind of what we're talking about right now, just football.' If charges are brought with regard to the incident in Dallas, Talib could face discipline under the NFL's personal conduct policy and a suspension seems possible given his history.

But the bad news \u2013 for them, at least \u2013 is that any well-earned break won\u2019t last for long. TV chiefs yesterday announced the Cornwall-set drama will be coming back for eight more episodes after it helped BBC1 deliver its strongest start to a year for a decade. Scroll down for video . Fans, rejoice! Aidan Turner has been signed up for a second series of BBC period drama Poldark . BBC1 boss Charlotte Moore confirmed that Turner\u2019s broody Ross would return for another series, alongside actress Eleanor Tomlinson, who plays love interest \u2013 and now wife \u2013 Demelza. \u2018I can exclusively announce that Sunday night\u2019s new phenomenon Poldark that has captured the nation\u2019s hearts has been commissioned for a second series,\u2019 Mrs Moore said, adding that the series had helped BBC1 to an \u2018outstanding start\u2019 this year. About 8.1million people on average have watched each episode, helping the flagship BBC channel attract more than a quarter of television viewers in evenings, when the battle for attention is most competitive. The series, based on Winston Graham\u2019s novels, follows Ross Poldark after he returns from the American War of Independence only to find that his father has died and his former fianc\u00e9e, Elizabeth, has married another man. There are 12 Poldark books in total, seven of which are set in the 18th century. The other five then follow Poldark\u2019s children through the 19th century. The first series of Poldark, written by Debbie Horsfield, covers the first of Mr Graham\u2019s two novels, named after Ross Poldark and Demelza. Successful role: Aidan has won legions of dedicated fans since stripping off as the swoon-worthy Captain Ross Poldark in the revival of the 1970s TV show . The second series will move on to the third and fourth books, named after their child, Jeremy, and scheming banker George Warleggan. Women up and down the country watched on tenterhooks as Poldark\u2019s affections shifted to his kitchen maid Demelza. But it is the scenes featuring Turner in a state of undress which sent them into the biggest frenzy. Many have taken to Twitter to express their approval whenever he appears without his shirt \u2013 working with a scythe in the fields or swimming naked in the sea. \u2018If Poldark gets any hotter we\u2019ll have to call the fire brigade,\u2019 one viewer commented.

Miss Walters, 21, was horrified to discover that the family looking after Magic had sold him at auction for just \u00a3200. Magic's fate has sparked fury in the equestrian community, and an appeal for his whereabouts has been shared 58,000 times on social media sites. Jade Walters, 21, was shocked to discover the family she loaned her beloved pet horse Magic to had sold the animal (pictured right and left being ridden by Miss Walters) for \u00a3200 . Selling a horse at auction is notoriously risky \u2013 bidders are not vetted and some horses are bought for slaughter. Miss Walters said: 'We would never in a million years have considered sending Magic to auction \u2013 they're horrible places. The thought makes me cry.' It was two months before she discovered the horse had been sold \u2013 making it all the more difficult to trace Magic, who could have been taken out of the country or sold to an abattoir. Miss Walters, who had owned the 17-year-old chestnut pony for seven years, said: 'I consider him like a child, he thinks of me as his mum and he's been taken from me. My heart is broken. 'He could be anywhere by now, I don't know how to find him and even if we do, what state will he be in?' The care assistant from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, advertised for a temporary owner last year after the cost of his upkeep went over \u00a34,000 a year. A woman in the West Country responded and took Magic to help her daughter improve her riding. Miss Walters pictured with her new horse Lad after her previous pet was sold at auction without her knowledge . Miss Walters said: 'He was getting very expensive. Loaning a horse is common for people who can't afford the expense of the purchase but can afford the upkeep. So while they don't have ownership, they have a duty of care. 'I was naive. The woman I loaned to seemed very respectable and said she wanted her 12-year-old daughter to get more experience riding.' But after six months, Magic's temporary owner said keeping the pony was too expensive and he was proving too difficult for her daughter to ride. They agreed that she would help Miss Walters look for an experienced rider to buy him for \u00a3500. But just 12 days later, on February 10, Magic was auctioned. However, Miss Walters did not find out until last week when she decided to bring Magic home. 'He has always been treated like a prince, so being fought over at an auction by a crowd looking for a quick deal makes me sick.' Her mother Julia, 53, said the woman had no right to auction Magic, adding: 'The arrangement was that if she had any interested parties, she would pass them to me. 'In no way was Magic to be sold without our knowledge.' Last night, the seller insisted there was 'another side to the story', but declined to comment further.", "reference": "Jade Walters, 21, loaned her horse Magic to help a young girl learn to ride .\nBut she was horrified to discover the family looking after him sold him .\nShe claims it was two months before she found out he was sold for \u00a3200 .\nNotoriously risky horse auctions often see animals being sold for slaughter ."}, "111": {"id": "91c0d2ba2ccab7161d9f4908a749d05b30098f88", "article": "Britain should be wary of adopting trendy pupil-led teaching techniques from Scandinavia because they may be making standards worse, a new report claims. Progressive education experts in the UK have long pushed for our system to emulate the group work and independent study that is popular in Finland, which has regularly topped international league tables. But a new analysis of Finnish education suggests pupil aptitude has actually declined since the country embraced fashionable teaching methods. Pupil-led techniques: A new analysis of Finnish education suggests pupil aptitude has actually declined since the country embraced fashionable teaching methods (file picture) According to research by the Right-leaning Centre for Policy Studies, Finland only did so well before because of the influence of traditional teacher-led methods. But it has slipped down international rankings tables as the new liberal techniques became more widespread. The findings will add weight to arguments by Michael Gove that a return to traditional teacher-led lessons are the way to raise standards in schools. The former education secretary made it his mission to fight the \u2018progressive\u2019 methodology of the education establishment, which he referred to as \u2018the Blob\u2019. Report author Gabriel Heller Sahlgren said: \u2018My research shows that the methods that we have been trying to push through in England and America for years are not good for test scores. \u2018Pupils who aren\u2019t motivated are not necessarily interested in learning. If you give them too much freedom, it\u2019s difficult to know if they\u2019re learning anything. It\u2019s not very effective. Former education secretary:\u00a0The findings will add weight to arguments by Michael Gove (pictured) that a return to traditional teacher-led lessons are the way to raise standards in schools . \u2018Here in the UK, there is a tendency to abolish traditional methods because they\u2019re old, but we need to decrease this bias.\u2019 Finland was proclaimed an \u2018education superpower\u2019 after appearing at the top of international rankings tables between 2001 and 2009. Many in the education establishment have pushed for the Finnish model of pupil-led learning to be used as an inspiration for the British system. Instead of giving whole-class instruction from a blackboard, teachers have instead adopted small group work, independent learning and educational activities and games. But today\u2019s report, which examines education policy and performance in Finland over the last half century, found implementation of the new methods coincided with a recent slump in performance. Between 2006 and 2012, Finland\u2019s performance in PISA tests run by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) declined. It sunk by 18 points in scientific literacy, 23 points in reading literacy, and 29 points in mathematical literacy. In 2006, it was second in the world for maths, while in 2012 it was 12th. Rankings for reading and science also slipped several places. Report author: Gabriel Heller Sahlgren (above) said the methods 'are not good for test scores' Teachers training in the 1990s learnt the new methods and only began to teach them in the 2000s, the report said. Before this, education in Finland had been traditional, hierarchical and teacher-led, according to the author, and it was this that was responsible for its stellar performances in the league tables. Mr Sahlgren added: \u2018The reforms in Finland that people are crediting with its improvement actually only began in the early 2000s. \u2018When Finland was improving, the education system was very authoritative and teacher-led. Finland was improving in the 1980s but rounded off in around 1995. In the early 2000s, it started to fall.\u2019 The report, titled \u2018Real Finnish Lessons\u2019, said that Finland\u2019s education system had instead been buoyed by socio-economic factors until recently. These included a strong work ethic and cultural sense of responsibility, as well as the high status of teachers leading to talented individuals entering the profession. Mr Gove prompted a fierce backlash from teachers two years ago after saying he wanted them to stop using innovative approaches which \u2018dumbed down\u2019 education. He gave an example of \u2018making Plasticine models to represent Hitler\u2019s main aims as Fuhrer\u2019 as a method which had \u2018nothing to do with passing on knowledge\u2019. He said part of the problem was a \u2018belief that education should not be an activity in which the teacher imparts knowledge to the child but a pursuit - by the child - of what it finds interesting\u2019.

Tesco does still have the biggest share of the lucrative market, which research by Kantar shows has grown by more than 10 per cent over the last year and is now worth \u00a3490million. The leader has improved its market share in the increasingly fashionable premium ale market, but it's believed Aldi is luring customers away from Tesco, offering a smaller range but cheaper prices. Another chapter: Fluctuations in the premium ale market are just a small part of the shopping revolution which has seen shoppers flock away from giants like Tesco and towards the growing discounters . To use an example of the difference in price, Aldi sells bottles of Newcastle brown ale for \u00a31.24. They costs \u00a31.64 at Tesco and Waitrose and \u00a31.65 at Morrisons. The discounter has also increased wine sales by 24 per cent over the last years which shows drinkers with all tastes are now flocking to Aldi to buy their booze. It's another chapter in the rise of discounters who are slowly stealing market share from the big three, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda. Other research, also by Kantar, showed that Aldi overtook Waitrose as Britain's sixth biggest supermarket with its performance in the first three months of 2015, increasing share of the whole supermarket industry from 4.6 top 5.3 per cent in a year. The top four supermarkets, Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons have all lost market share in the first three months of 2015. Aldi, Waitrose and Lidl managed to increase thiers, with Aldi showing the biggest rise . Tesco has had a troublesome year, with its year-on-year share price down 18 per cent. Last year, they discovered a \u00a3263million gap in their accounts which involved rebates to suppliers and is being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office. Shortly afterwards they sacked boss Phil Clarke who was replaced by Unilever executive Dave Lewis, who announced a series of money-saving measures to try and turn the tide.. The research into the premium ale market doesn't tell a very consistent story, with all but two of the big supermarkets managing to increase their market share. Sainsbury's currently has the second largest share in the beer market which it has improved by 7 per cent while Asda, third, increased by 1.5 per cent. Upmarket Waitrose, which also saw a double-digit increase in the premium ale market, now has a 5.1 per cent share of the entire supermaket industry. But while Aldi made great gains, Lidl, the other rising discounter to have improved its share in the supermarket industry, saw a 7.9 per cent fall in its proportion of the premium beer market. Morrisons\u2019 share dipped 1.4 per cent . In January Tesco published the location of 43 loss-making stores that will close, and shelved plans to open a further 49 stores. City bosses expect them to announce huge losses in profit next week. It's been a totally different story for Aldi, which offers cheap prices and a smaller range that have helped them compete with the big boys. Aldi \u2013 motto Spend a little. Live a lot \u2013 stocks virtually all own-branded goods and and they're market share has grown by 0.7 per cent this year. It plans to open 60 new stores in 2015, more than than Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco put together. Between January and the end of March, Aldi sales grew by 17 per cent from the same time a year earlier. The total market share of the \u2018big four\u2019 fell below 73 per cent, the lowest for a decade. Kantar Worldpanel said Aldi had recorded double-digit growth for the past four years. More than half a million new shoppers visited the store in the three months to March 29, compared to a year before. Lidl also saw sales jump by almost 12 per cent over the period to secure a 3.7 per cent market share.

A dog has been evicted from social housing for terrorising  postmen\u00a0- meaning neighbours can have their mail delivered for the first time since February 2014. Mother-of-two Hayley Sandiford has been told she must get rid of her seven-stone American bulldog Winston by the end of April or she will also have to leave her house in Blackburn, Lancashire. The pet has attacked several terrified postmen but Miss Sandiford says Royal Mail are victimising Winston and claims her family are being 'taunted all the time' by people in the area. Angry neighbours have even left notes on her front door saying 'keep your devil dog away', she says. One postman on his rounds reported Winston bounded 100 yards up the street towards him before clamping his powerful teeth around his mailbag. The victim had to cower behind a tree and throw his one remaining letter to distract the animal before diving behind a gate and alerting a colleague to take cover. A second postmen reported being being bitten on the arm and had to kick Winston in the head twice to fend him off. Winston's attacks have led to a 14 month ban on all postal deliveries to 60 homes in his neighbourhood. Residents living on two surrounding roads  have been making make a four-and-a-half mile round trips, sometimes by taxi, to collect their mail. Twin Valley Homes housing association has now taken Miss Sandiford, 30, to court and she must find a new home for the dog by 4pm on April 30 or her tenancy is at risk. Obsessed: Miss Sandiford admits her American bulldog has 'a thing' for chewing up mail - but unfortunately this has led to him also attacking postal staff . Legal battle: A housing association has decided to end a ban on postal deliveries to the area of Blackburn by demanding that Winston is evicted . The ruling at Preston County Court means the post to the area is due to resume on May 1. Today Miss Sandiford, who has asked a friend to take in Winston, said: 'I feel sick and gutted to be losing Winston. Winston had been brilliant and I have done everything they asked me to do but they're still making a big deal out of it. Court case: Miss Sandiford outside court last year after Winston was threatened with destruction for attacking a postie . 'I have had things stuck on my door saying keep my 'devil dog' away. I don't even like going out anymore I'm not the same kind of person. My kids have been affected at school through it because people would say stuff and my son gets into trouble because of that. We are being taunted all the time. 'Winston is one of the nicest dogs. He is not a danger - I wouldn't have him near my kids. 'Unfortunately he does have a thing about postmen but it is the mail they carry and not the postmen themselves. I don't get much post only bills and a lot of junk mail and he loves ripping them up. He doesn't touch the kids toys he'd rather play with the leaflets that come through the door. 'Winston did jump up at the postman - but he is a very bouncy playful little thing and he forgets how big he is - although I accept it must have been scary for the postman.' Winston's first trouble came in February last year after it bit an unnamed postman on the arm whilst being taken for a walk by his owner's nine-year-old son. The postman suffered a bite wound which broke his skin and he underwent medical treatment in hospital. Although postal deliveries were suspended no action was initially taken against the animal but at 10am on July 9 the 'thick set and stocky built' dog bounded up to postman Paul Warnock whilst he was on his rounds. Mr Warnock who had only delivered to only a handful of houses later told a court hearing: 'Straight away I was worried because it was quite a big dog. As soon as it spotted me it came running towards me fast, at speed. 'Then it was showing it's teeth and growling at me. It was coming at me aggressively, I was frightened. I was backing off then all of a sudden it went for me it grabbed the bundle of mail. It was in the middle of the street because I was backing off so much.' Mr Warnock ran behind a tree for cover and added: 'When I got behind the tree I saw a gate, I thought if I can get inside the gate it's safe. I was left with one letter. It was still going for me. I had one piece on mail, I threw it to take it's eye off me and ran behind the gate. It would have attacked me in the street.' Keen: Winston once ran 100 yards to get to a post bag and the postman only managed to dive into a garden because he tossed a letter into the middle of the road . 'When I got behind the gate the dog was roaming the street. I saw my colleague further up the street coming down, he heard the commotion. I shouted \"Get back get back, dog loose on the street!\".' His colleague took cover behind a gate and watched Miss Sandiford get hold of the dog. Last October Miss Sandiford pleaded guilty to being the owner of a dog dangerously out of control and was handed a six month community order with a six month supervision requirement. She was also told that whenever is taken out for walks, he must be muzzled and kept on a harness with two dog leads and has to be accompanied by a person over the age of 16. Miss Sandiford was also ordered to keep her home securely fenced, but now it appears she must part with Winston to keep her home. David King, one of Miss Sadiford's neighbours said: 'It's brilliant news if they are going to start up the deliveries again. We've waited a long time to get the mail back. My wife is disabled and having to go down to the depot every time we get a letter is hugely frustrating. It's also frustrating that it has taken so long for this to be sorted. Trevor Smith said: 'The Royal Mail could have handled this a lot better and sorted it sooner. I can't understand why they stopped delivering to so many houses anyway. I'm not happy about it. I'll believe the deliveries are restarting when I see it.' Ian Bell, head of Twin Valley Homes, said: 'We're delighted to get this result. The people in the area have suffered due to a lack of a postal service and being in fear of this dog for too long, but now they can see an end in sight. The Royal Mail confirmed a health and safety assessment had been carried out on Miss Sandiford's neighbourhood which highlighted an 'unacceptable level of risk associated with deliveries.' A spokesman said 'Suspending deliveries is a last resort but we take the health and safety of our employees very seriously. We apologise to all affected customers and we are pleased with this outcome.'", "reference": "Court rules American bulldog Winston must leave his home this month .\nPet's attacks led to 14-month ban on  deliveries on two Blackburn roads .\nHis owner Hayley Sandiford claims Winston is 'not a danger' to anyone .\n'Unfortunately he does have a thing about postmen but it is the mail they carry and not the postmen themselves', she said .\nWinston's eviction means that postal deliveries will resume on May 1 ."}, "116": {"id": "d442ef485d738eeeed7c21778899dd3b17048736", "article": "A parody video that mocks American skiers and plays on stereotypes about US tourists has gone viral on the internet, but not all viewers are finding it amusing. The profanity-laced comedy sketch by 26 Minutes, a news satire programme broadcast by Radio Television Suisse, follows \u2018Jeff Randl\u2019, who travels to Switzerland to compete in Xtreme Verbier. With more than 300,000 views on YouTube since late March, some viewers said they were offended or didn\u2019t find the humour in the show\u2019s over-the-top depiction of Americans on the slopes in Switzerland. The comedy sketch follows 'Jeff Randl', who travels to 'Sweden' to compete in Xtreme Verbier . Jeff, portrayed by one of the French-language show\u2019s presenters, is a blonde, mop-haired snowboarder who tells the camera he has travelled from Lake Forest, California to \u2018Sweden\u2019 to compete in the freeriding event. The Bible-toting and pot-smoking character plays on the usual stereotypes about US tourists \u2013 from being loud and inconsiderate to arrogant and less worldly. Scenes show Jeff smoking a \u2018joint\u2019 while travelling up the mountain on a gondola, saying \u2018Excuse me, I\u2019m American\u2019 as he pushes his way past other skiers or snowboarders, and barrelling down the slopes without care or caution. At one point, Jeff tells the camera: \u2018Sweden, I think that\u2019s one of the 50 states of Europe or something. I don\u2019t like it too much here, you don\u2019t give a s*** what people are saying.\u2019 Jeff (right) offends others by being loud, jumping queues and smoking marijuana on a gondola . He later takes offence to a rainbow-coloured gondola, saying: \u2018Hey, this machine is gay. I don\u2019t like it.\u2019 The end of the video shows Jeff being buried in an \u2018avalanche\u2019 and pulling his Bible out of his jacket. When he is hauled out of the snow by a rescue team, he believes he is saved by God and shouts: \u2018I\u2019m American, and God bless America.\u2019 The video has received mixed reviews on YouTube, although the majority of comments appear to be from those who found humour in the satire. The snowboarder takes offence to a rainbow-coloured gondola at the Swiss ski resort of Verbier . Of the negative reviews, one viewer wrote: \u2018Kind of offended by this, definitely not entertained. Pretty poorly thought out satire.\u2019 Another said: \u2018Still trying to find the funny in this.\u2019 Of those who found it funny, one viewer said: \u2018I\u2019m an American\u2026 and I freaking love this\u2019.

Comedian Vincent Kucholl, who played the role of Jeff, told Swiss newspaper Le Matin that he has enjoyed seeing the response from Americans, and he rejected suggestions that the sketch was racist. He said: \u2018It\u2019s funny that they are reacting ... but we did nothing wrong.

Yet the 29-year-old German, who trails Hamilton by 17 points in the drivers' standings, is deeply concerned by Ferrari from what he witnessed over the course of the two 90-minute sessions. 'We are very quick on one lap again, and Ferrari are very dangerous on the long run,' said Rosberg. 'They have serious pace, which is very worrying. It looks like they are a genuine threat.

The elephant's 32nd birthday would have taken place on Wednesday. Studies vary on how long Asian elephants live in captivity. A 2008 study which looked at Asian elephants in European zoos says they have a median life expectancy of 19 years. A 2004 study indicated a 36-year median for Asian elephants in North America. Zoo veterinarian Jim Storms said in a\u00a0release on the Oregon Zoo's website that Rama's 2013 tuberculosis diagnosis did not play a role. Deputy Director Chris Pfefferkorn said in the release the leg injury took place in 1990 as Rama was sexually maturing.\u00a0He said in what is considered normal activity for the animals, older female elephants shoved Rama out of the herd and into a moat.

A Labour shadow minister was left gobsmacked after a primary school pupil told him he supported Ukip \u2013 because he wanted to get 'all the foreigners out the country' Mr Hunt appeared taken aback by the child's support for Ukip to get all the foreigners out the country . The exchange at Howitt Primary School at Heanor, Derbyshire, was recorded by BBC East Midlands and broadcast last night. Today the headteacher said that the unnamed boy's comments were 'not representative of the school'. The school has more than 400 pupils aged three to 11 and spent the last two years in special measures until January this year. Its latest Ofsted report says: 'Most pupils come from White British backgrounds. There are very few pupils from other heritage groups or who speak English as an additional language'. In the town of Heanor, which is 10 miles north of Derby, 98.2 per cent of the population is white. Nigel Farage yesterday insisted Ukip was not anti-immigration . In 2006 a Channel 5 documentary dubbed the town the 'skinhead capital of Britain' when the BNP came second in a council by-election and a government advisor said later that it was one of a few 'unhealthily all white' towns in the UK. The remarks come just 24 hours after Ukip claimed it was not an anti-immigrant party. A Ukip spokesman today claimed the boy had been brainwashed by the media. He said: 'Sadly I suspect the child has been drinking in all the propaganda. This is the information that people are continually being told, but it's not true. 'I thought it was rather sad that he thinks that is what Ukip is for. But it is not a surprise because that is how we are portrayed in the media.' The party's manifesto chief Suzanne Evans cast doubt on the party's promise to ban unskilled workers for five years before telling supporters that Ukip was not anti-immigration. In remarks which risk angering supporters opposed to foreigners arriving in the UK, Mrs Evans said: 'Ukip is not anti-immigration. Immigrants are not the problem. It's our current immigration system that is the problem. 'We will not pull up the drawbridge, we will simply start to control who walks over it.' However the manifesto includes a pledge to limit net migration to 50,000 and introduce a total ban on unskilled migration for five years. Yesterday it emerged Ukip has abandoned hopes of winning dozens of seats at the General Election and is now targeting just ten. The party reduced the number of constituencies where it is concentrating resources as it loses ground in the polls. A party strategist said 'something extraordinary' would now need to happen for it to win in places outside its target list. Since October, support for Ukip has tumbled from 19 to just 12 per cent as voters focus on the big choice between Labour and the Tories at the election.", "reference": "Primary school pupil told Tristram Hunt he would vote Ukip if he could .\nThe child, 10, explained it was so to 'get all the foreigners out the country'\nHis mother tonight admitted she was embarrassed by the exchange .\nShe said she had sat her son down and explained it 'isn't about foreigners'"}, "122": {"id": "bd455285a50d2889e62524440a636c7946280b7c", "article": "The goals may have dried up at club level for Graziano Pelle but the Southampton striker repaid Italy coach Antonio Conte's faith by scoring against England.

His sleepless nights must be becoming all the more frequent as these haunting weeks go by. Down rained the boos yet again from a disgruntled bunch of supporters who deserve so much more than this; far more than a team lacking identity and direction. Those fans will quite rightly point to the fact their side were out-played for large parts against Rotherham, a club with a far inferior budget and experience at this level. They are losing faith in their manager, even though Fulham should retain their Championship status from here. Ross McCormack (left) pokes home the equaliser but Fulham were unable to push on for the winner . That they came away with a point was down to poor finishing from the Yorkshire visitors, nothing more. Ross McCormack came to the rescue after Matt Derbyshire\u2019s early opener to spare blushes. Fulham just want this wretched campaign over. \u2018First half we were awful,\u2019 Symons said. \u2018Second half was a huge improvement to a bit better than awful. We\u2019re limping closer. \u2018The sooner we get the points needed the sooner I\u2019ll start sleeping in an evening.\u2019 That spoke volumes. Kit Symons (centre) admitted his side were second best and says the club need to rebuild in the summer . \u2018It is slow and it\u2019s painful. We need to rebuild in the summer. It\u2019s an anxious period - people are concerned. The players did show good character to come from behind.\u2019 Steve Evans\u2019 team still await their fate after being charged for fielding an ineligible player, Farrend Rawson, during the win against Brighton earlier this month. Should the Football League follow the precedent set with AFC Wimbledon last year, the Millers will find themselves lumped with a three-point deduction. When that judgement is to be made remains unclear - although it almost certainly will come before the final day on May 2 - meaning the relegation dogfight could go to the wire, with resurgent Millwall enjoying a game in hand. Rotherham knew points must be won here, and set about bossing proceedings from the very first minute. Matt Derbyshire (centre) pokes home the opener after four minutes to put Steve Evans' side in the lead . Fulham XI:\u00a0Bettinelli, Richards, Turner, Burn, Husband, Parker, Guthrie, Tunnicliffe (Hoogland - 54), Ruiz, McCormack, Smith .

Goals: Derbyshire 4 . Booked: Broadfoot . Referee: Andy Davies . How it came to pass that Matt Derbyshire might\u2019ve put the visitors three goals up inside the first four minutes will mystify Symons. Eventually the former Olympiacos striker settled for one, the simplicity galling for a club who were facing Tottenham this time a year ago. Firstly Derbyshire clipped wide inside the six-yard box before the long legs of Dan Burn prevented him from tapping home seconds later. But Fulham fell asleep from Ben Pringle\u2019s corner to present Derbyshire with a third opportunity and he wasn\u2019t to miss, stabbing in from close range to signal the Craven Cottage dissenters to find their voice. Matt Smith\u2019s header was cleared off the line in an instant reply, but Symons\u2019 side looked shot, as they had been here against Brentford and Wigan previously. And they allowed Derbyshire in again, this time Burn misreading a high ball, but he was thwarted by Marcus Bettinelli. Danny Ward squandered a glorious chance from 12 yards, skewing a shot wide as Fulham continued to be carved open. Bryan Ruiz (10) is denied a goal by the on-rush Arsenal loanee\u00a0Emiliano Martinez of Rotherham . Fulham's remaining  fixtures:\u00a0Blackpool\u00a0(A), Middlesbrough\u00a0(H),Norwich (A) Rotherham's remaining fixtures: Norwich (H), Reading (H), Leeds (A) Kirk Broadfoot was guilty of missing a superb chance from another corner and the central defender later struck a post. Saying they could have scored five before the break isn\u2019t hyperbolic. 'They could've been out of sight,' admitted Symons. Bryan Ruiz spurned a good opportunity for the hosts, McCormack then failing to stretch far enough to covert at the back post. Every stray pass was met with groans, each overhit cross with sighs. Many are resigned to these turgid displays, but more than a small section just will not accept it. Symons was bailed out by McCormack though, who got on the end of Scott Parker\u2019s pass to poke in a 67th-minute equaliser. It was a rare moment of quality, but edges them closer to safety. Matt Smith (centre) was unable to continue his good goalscoring form for the Cottagers . \u2018The goal is a blatant handball by McCormack,\u2019 Rotherham assistant Paul Raynor fumed. \u2018We dominated possession and created a number of opportunities.\u2019 \u2018You hope something\u2019s going to fall for us. One thing that can never be labelled against our team is a lot of character and desire. That\u2019s the minimum we expect. We\u2019re enjoying the challenge and had a difficult week. A good word to use is defiance.\u2019 Symons added: \u2018I\u2019ve seen the goal again and there\u2019s probably an element of doubt, but I\u2019d expect them to have a moan about it.\u2019 The goal gave the whole place a lift, Smith unfortunate not to win a penalty after Craig Morgan\u2019s shove and substitute Tim Hoogland thumped a header over when unmarked at the back post. Oddly, one point may have been three but that would\u2019ve merely masked glaring deficiencies. For all the talk of difficulties, staying in the division is the only thing that matters.

Deila believes treble success will help not only attract players to the club this summer, but also help keep those who are already at Parkhead and perhaps thinking of moving to pastures new.

The building, which was built in the 1960s and belongs to Zheng Gong Hospital in Henan Province, was under threat of demolition as it is situated in the path of a road expansion project, reports\u00a0People's Daily Online. But hospital bosses decided to save time and money - and avoid paying for a new building - and employed a team of engineers to put 'wheels' on the building. The two-storey brick hospital outpatient building in China is being rolled every day on giant metal 'wheels' The large brick building is 1,700 square metres in size and needs more than 1,000 wheels to 'roll' it . Now, the two-storey hospital outpatient building in the city of Zhengzhou, in central China, is being slowly and carefully pushed just a few metres a day on the giant cylinder-shaped rollers. The engineers aim to 'push' the entire structure south by 17.5 metres to its new, designated spot, away from the demolition zone. The 'wheels' the building is being moved on are large, cylinder-shaped metal rollers. The People's Daily reports the large brick building is 1,700 square metres in size and requires more than 1,000 wheels to make the daily 'walk' possible. One of the engineers working on the project secures the metal sheeting and rollers which are being used . It will take three days of careful and slow rolling to move the hospital building 17.5m to its new, safe spot . While it should only take three days to move the building to its newly assigned spot, engineers say the preparation has taken over a month. The entire building was initially placed on metal plates, which then had the cylinder-shaped rollers wedged between them. The ambitious project is expected to be completed in the next couple of days. It is not the first time engineers in China have carried out such a move. In November 2013 a six-storey building in Shanghai which weighed 12,000 tonnes was moved 38 metres with the help of 18 lifting jacks. And according to the Guinness Book of Records the largest building to have ever been moved in this way is another Chinese achievement - in 2004 the Fu gang Building in Guangxi Province was moved 36 metres and took 11 days to complete.

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has spoken - and acted - in a way which suggests her strong supporting for legalizing same sex marriage . Ruth Bader Ginsburg has already made up her mind about gay marriage, a report has claimed, ahead of a landmark Supreme Court hearing which could legalize the practice nationwide. The famously liberal justice, who is 82, will be part of a decision which begins hearing arguments tomorrow on whether states are allowed to ban same-sex unions and refuse to recognize those made in other states. Ginsburg, who has sat on the court since 1993, has been unusually open about her opinions ahead of the cases. cutting against a long-held tradition of not speaking out in advance. The new report, Yahoo! Politics, cited interviews in which Ginsburg has referred to the American public becoming more accepting of gay rights in general - and has even officiated at same-sex ceremonies. Ahead of the first such ceremony, held in Washington, D.C., \u00a0in August 2013, she told the Washington Post\u00a0that she understood the symbolic implications of her involvement. She said the wedding, of her friend\u00a0Michael M. Kaiser, president of the Kennedy Center, to economist John Roberts, would 'be one more statement that people who love each other and want to live together should be able to enjoy the blessings and the strife in the marriage relationship.' She will get the chance to make her views known in the upcoming case of Obergefell v. Hodges, for which arguments will be heard from Tuesday and a decision is expected this summer. The case is being brought by James Obergefell, an Ohio man who married his husband in Maryland but was not allowed to name himself as spouse on his husband's death certificate in his home state. Currently 37 states allow gay marriage, as well as Washington, D.C. - but Ohio is one of 13 which has held out. Protests: Pictured are gay rights protesters camped out in front of the Supreme Court this weekend.\u00a0Obergefell v. Hodges will be heard from tomorrow . Votes: Ginsburg is one of four liberal-voting Supreme Court justices, though Anthony Kennedy (front row, second from right) has often sided with them on gay rights issues. Pictured above are all the Supreme Court Justices. On the front row (left to right) are Clarence Thomas, Antonin Scalia, John G. Roberts, Kennedy and Ginsburg. Behind them (also left to right) are\u00a0Sonia Sotomayor, Stephen Breyer, Sameul Alito and Elena Kagan . The Supreme Court will determine whether the Constitution guarantees all citizens the right to same sex marriage, which could void all the remaining bans. And if it determines that recognizing gay marriage is still up to individual states, the court could also decide that states are obliged to recognize gay marriage performed elsewhere in the U.S. After a 2012 ruling, the federal government is already required to recognize gay marriage in states where they are allowed. The liberal wing's four justices are expected to vote in favor of gay marriage, and could be joined by the more conservative Anthony Kennedy, who has often sided with liberals on issues of personal freedom, which would provide the five votes necessary for a majority. In an interview with Bloomberg\u00a0earlier this year, Ginsburg insisted that 'it would not take a large adjustment' for Americans to accept gay marriage across the board, and that the country has become far more accepting. Gay marriage opponents have said that Ginsburg previous actions and public statements go so far as to make her unfit to hear the case. Battle: The case was prompted by James Obergefell, left, who wants the state of Ohio to recognize him as his husband's spouse on his death certificate. He is taking on Richard Hodges, right, who leads Ohio's department of health . Couple: Obergefell, left, married his husband John Arthur in Maryland shortly before his death - but has not been allowed to name himself as Arthur's spouse on his death certificate . Both the National Organization for Marriage and the American Family Association, which oppose gay marriage, have demanded that Ginsburg remove herself from the case because she officiated over the ceremony. They made the same demand of Justice Elena Kagan, another liberal justice, who has officiated a ceremony as well. If both justices were to agree it would leave the court two liberals down and unlikely to side with the legalization. However, according to legal scholars, neither has done anything wrong because the earlier court decision had already vindicated same-sex marriages in states which had legalized them. It has been speculated that Justice Kennedy could be the swing vote in this issue. A recent report by the\u00a0Associated Press\u00a0speculated that his professional links with a California law school dean who hired him in the 1950s could have embedded some early sympathies. The report, citing people who knew him when he taught at McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, said that being mentored by Gordon Schaber, who never married and was widely thought to gay, could swing him towards favoring gay rights. Kennedy is likely, the report said, to eventually write the Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which would follow several other written opinions expanding gay rights.", "reference": "Liberal champion, 82, has spoken widely about gay rights .\nShe even officiated at a same-sex ceremony in August 2013 .\nOpponents have said it makes her unfit to rule on upcoming case .\nObergefell v.

Over the pond, New York City FC manager Jason Kreis is finding life increasingly difficult following a patchy start to the season which continued on Thursday night as Philadelphia Union snatched a late draw in a match which had been bossed for long periods by the men in sky blue. The pressure hasn\u2019t reached Manuel Pellegrini proportions. It's too early for that. New York City FC's Mehdi Ballouchy opened the scoring before his side were pegged back . Yet Kreis and NYCFC will be under no illusions about the task in hand. Things need to improve. And fast. A superb second half strike from Mehdi Ballouchy looked to have put an end to a run of just one win from the first five matches. But, as is ever the case in MLS, haphazard defending allowed CJ Sapong to stab in on 86 minutes. As long as David Villa stays fit - he came off at halftime with a hamstring strain here - and the squad continues to gel, Frank Lampard will arrive here in the summer and join a side who slowly but surely will have adapted to the task in hand by then. This though was a reminder of how much work needs to be done. The Big Apple sports fans have been quick to adopt City\u2019s plans though it will take more time \u2013 and a more wins \u2013 for the club to really catch light. They will never, and don\u2019t expect to compare to the might of the Yankees, Knicks, Jets or Giants. They are sporting titans in a city bursting with stars. Certainly a look around Yankees Stadium at kick-off was all you needed to see that the initial spike of interest in NYCFC has quickly dimmed. David Villa was forced off with a hamstring injury at half time on Thursday night . The opening game attendance of over 60,000 seemed like a hazy distant memory. It\u2019s another reminder, not that the club bosses required one, of the desperate need for a permanent football specific home. But, to be fair, as the game wore on the atmosphere and excitement was enough to leave the attendees wanting more even if the League itself does little to help the product on the pitch. MLS needs to start acknowledging international breaks like everyone else. City\u2019 s Mix Diskerud, arguably their best player thus far, was unavailable having played for the US in their win over Mexico on Wednesday night while the likes Robbie Keane missed League matches during the last round of Euro 2016 qualifier. That cannot help the progress of the game here. Another quirk this side of the pond saw Philadelphia lock horns with Kreis\u2019 side just four days after beating them at home 2-1. It\u2019s perhaps an attempt to recreate the mini-series of matches like in baseball. City, though, created nothing of note early on. David Villa\u2019s second MLS strike in Philadelphia had brought his side level before Vincent Nogueira slotted home a late winner yet the Spanish star was feeding off scraps here. Indeed the chances were falling at the other end of the pitch, Venezuelan striker Fernando Aristeguieta firing just over to keep the stuttering home side firmly on their toes. Villa sparked into life every time the ball fell at his feet yet his markers weren\u2019t giving an inch. Three surrounded the former Barcelona forward on 25 minutes and after he was ushered out of play, full-back Sheanon Williams needed no invitation to get stuck into the Spaniard by pushing his square in the chest. New York City have made a slow start to the MLS season, winning just once . It was handbags at best. Yet it showed just how wary Union were of Villa\u2019s class. And on 27 minutes, the first moment of magic should have resulted in the opener. A sweet flick from the 33 year-old beautifully teed up Ballouchy only for the Moroccan to blaze over. He really should have scored. It goes without saying that Villa was emphatically the best player on the pitch. A canny dummy helped split the Philadelphia backline in half but Khiry Shelton couldn\u2019t get round keeper John McCarthy. Kreis needed the rest of the team to start performing after the break though. And , to their credit, they did. Ned Grabavoy was denied by McCarthy\u2019s outstretched leg before Adam Nemec headed wide. Finally there was some urgency and on 57 minutes, there was a goal. It was a superb strike by Ballouchy who cut inside with an excellent first touch before curling home. Philadelphia though, home of Rocky Balboa, stayed strong before delivering that late knock-out blow. Perhaps Kreis should give Pellegrini a call at some point soon. Both are enduring tough times.", "reference": "New York City FC's patchy start to the season continued .\nMehdi Ballouchy put the home side ahead but CJ Sapong levelled late on .\nCity have won just one of their opening six matches in MLS .\nDavid Villa was forced off at half time with a hamstring strain ."}, "129": {"id": "014176e9e7b04a1adf06c2fd7ed764e5adee98b3", "article": "HBO has launched its HBO NOW channel on the Apple TV set-top box, iPhone and iPad ahead of the series premiere of HBO hit show Game of Thrones on\u00a0April 12.

The HBO Now service however, is currently only available in the US.\u00a0The company has not yet revealed whether HBO Now will be rolled out internationally. With HBO Now, the company is aiming to reach people who have broadband access but don't want to pay for a traditional TV package of dozens of other channels. For the monthly fee, viewers will be able to get HBO content without having to pay for an entire cable package, the company said. The first month is free for early-bird subscribers, the company added. 'This is a transformative moment for HBO,' said chief executive Richard Pepler after an introduction from Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook. The service will ship with the Apple TV in the US, which is now at a lower price of $69 (\u00a345). The price cut is a reaction to devices such as the Google Chromecast having lowered their price to $35 and Roku 2 costing just $70. Time Warner said it wants to push its HBO Now service to the 10 million broadband households that are not subscribed to a cable TV bundle service. It is also targeting the 70 million US cable TV subscribers who aren't HBO subscribers. Outside the US, HBO shows are available through online and pay TV subscription services, such as Sky.

The shere volume of snow that fell earlier this year, nearly 65 inches fell in February alone, means that huge piles of the white stuff still remain. Except the remaining 'snow' isn't very white any more but rather a disgusting black color riddled with trash including broken pieces of glass, plastic shards and goodness knows what else.

To some avid skiers snow is still snow and one in particular couldn't resist the urge to take to the slopes of Boston's temporary new resort. Vlad Tarasov even filmed his journey down the slopes at Boston's largest snow farm located in the city's Seaport District. 'I've been skiing for 20 years, but never like this,' he told The Boston Globe\u00a0about the 'surreal' experience of climbing the slopes on April 5 and looking down the South Boston urban sprawl. The one-minute video gives viewers a first-person perspective of the experience as Tarasov pushes through the filthy, trash-filled ice pile that served as a dumping ground for the historic winter snowfall. Tarasov recalls having to avoid junk including rusted lawn chairs, parking cones, broken bottles, and 'pretty much every kind of trash you'd ever find on a Boston street.'

Sanchez had his selection of clubs once Barcelona had decided to let him leave, and following the World Cup, the 26-year-old was convinced to continue his career under Wenger's expert guidance, going on to make an instant impression in English football. The French coach, however, admits the possibility Liverpool could use their interest in Sanchez as leverage during negotiations over Luis Suarez's move to the Nou Camp last summer was always on the cards. Alexis Sanchez was courted by a number of elite clubs last summer but eventually chose Arsenal . Sanchez has made an instant impact in English football and has scored 19 goals so far this season . Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger (right) is delighted that Sanchez decided to join the north London club . 'At the end of the day, only Sanchez can explain to you why he has chosen us. I don't know why he did that, but we are happy that he made that decision,' said Wenger of the \u00a332million Chile forward, who has netted 19 goals so far. 'I was (aware of Liverpool's interest), but you never know if it is really true, but I thought it could be because of the interest in Suarez (from Barcelona). 'In the negotiations, yes, it is a strength - and it makes sense, an exchange and some money for Liverpool.' Wenger believes the way Sanchez has adapted so quickly to a change in environment proves he is one of the best around. 'If you look at the qualities, efficiency, work-rate, fighting spirit - (he is at the) top,' the Arsenal boss added. 'When it (the game) becomes flat, he can revitalise the strengths and dynamics of the team and the supporters.' Ahead of the key Barclays Premier League clash, Wenger was keen to play down any talk of a potential summer transfer move for Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling, who has so far rejected a new contract offer. Despite the Reds having lost to Manchester United before the international break to dent hopes of another top-four finish, Wenger has been impressed by the way Brendan Rodgers has developed his team following the sale of Suarez and injury to striker Daniel Sturridge. 'He has done very well. I think he found a solution at the right time,' the Arsenal manager said.

Tim Farron was accused by the dead man's widow of 'betrayal' after an inquest found that Jo Stephenson jumped from the roof of his house while suffering 'intense stress'. Mr Stephenson, deputy leader of Cumbria County Council, fell from the three-storey property in Windermere after being vilified over new parking charges in Mr Farron's Westmorland and Lonsdale constituency. Now Mr Stephenson\u2019s widow Hilary has angrily accused Mr Farron \u2013 a former party president dubbed \u2018Saint Tim\u2019 because of his religious beliefs \u2013 of reneging on a deal to support her late husband over the policy. Tim Farron (left) was accused by Jo Stephenson's (centre) widow Hilary (right) of 'betrayal' after an inquest found that he jumped from the roof of his house while suffering 'intense stress' Mr Stephenson initially survived his fall and was coherent enough to tell the paramedics that he had intended to kill himself. He died of his injuries three weeks later. The shocking sequence of events unfolded after Mr Stephenson led controversial Lib Dem plans to boost the council's income by ending free street parking in Cumbria. Local sources claim that Mr Farron \u2013 favourite to replace Mr Clegg if the party flops in the Election \u2013 promised to support the charges in return for the exemption of Liberal Democrat-dominated parts of the county. But, according to Mrs Stephenson, when the plan provoked a furious backlash from local residents, Mr Farron stayed quiet as 59-year-old Mr Stephenson was bombarded with aggressive messages on Facebook and Twitter. 'They'd negotiated a deal but Tim reneged on it and shoved Jo into the forefront to take the wrath,' she told The Mail on Sunday. 'Jo would just say, 'it's not what gentlemen do, is it?' But it is what politicians do. I don't know the details of it [the deal]. I just know Farron reneged on it and it left Jo in a very uncomfortable position. He felt betrayed. 'When I found out that Tim Farron happened to be on holiday on the date of Jo's funeral, I was very pleased. Would I have barred him? Let's just say I was very happy that the date coincided with his holiday.' Kendal coroner's court heard last month that in the run-up to the day on which he jumped off his roof, Mr Stephenson had been under 'considerable political pressure', and 'preoccupied by a culmination of matters'. Nick Clegg's arch-rival for the leadership of the Liberal Democrats Tim Farron (pictured) was at the centre of a bitter row last night over the death of one of the party's councillors . He dialled 999 himself, telling the operator: 'Come quickly. I threw myself off the roof, I tried to kill myself.' The deputy coroner ruled that the fall was 'no accident' but stopped short of ruling Mr Stephenson committed suicide. Mrs Stephenson, who had two children with Mr Stephenson, does not believe her husband was suicidal but that he was so distressed by the personal attacks on him, he was not thinking properly. She recalled: 'I looked out of the bedroom window and saw an ambulance outside. I found Jo propped up against a chair talking to the paramedic on the phone.' Last month, Mr Farron launched a thinly-veiled leadership challenge to Mr Clegg, saying he would bring the party 'back from the dead'. The committed Christian brushed aside claims by enemies in the Clegg camp that he was a 'sanctimonious, God-bothering, treacherous little s***', and vowed to revive the Lib Dems. Mrs Stephenson questioned Tim Farron's 'saintly' image, saying: 'He wants everyone to love him and do what he says but he is just a typical modern politician who likes to whizz around the Lakes from one photo opportunity to another. 'He may see himself as a future leader of the Lib Dems but he's not the sort of character I would like to see in that job.' Mrs Stephenson said her husband was 'absolutely delightful,' adding: 'Jo didn't seek political glory, he wasn't like that.' Last night, Mr Farron, 44, said: 'I'm really saddened by these comments which are completely false and I strongly refute them. 'That does not change the fact that I have immense compassion for Hilary. Jo was an outstanding servant to our community and he is hugely missed.'", "reference": "Jo Stephenson's widow accused Tim Farron of betraying her late husband .\nHe was vilified over the new parking charges in Mr Farron's constituency .\nDeputy leader of Cumbria County Council fell from a three-storey property .\nAn inquest found he jumped from the roof while suffering 'intense stress'"}, "133": {"id": "e18345390254b92ea517b2ea39ef8c9f5f683019", "article": "How do you fancy taking a tour of the Grand Mosque of Abu Dhabi, seeing Berlin's historic Checkpoint Charlie or exploring Cape Peninsula in South Africa?

The photographer admitted he has been chasing shots of skiers on volcanoes for several years and said he was thrilled to finally capture the image to perfectly contrast the hot and cold conditions. He said: 'It was a bit unreal seeing Oscar skiing near the lava. 'I was chasing this image for around five years and have tried, unsuccessfully, at many active volcanoes in South America, North America, Europe and Asia - but things always stopped me. 'Bad weather often reduced the visibility, eruptions are obviously very unpredictable and skiers weren't always around.

Centre-backs Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo will also miss the trip to the Premier League leaders, and with Jonny Evans completing his six-match ban, Louis van Gaal described it as \u2018the worst scenario\u2019. Jones and Blind, who was injured by Vincent Kompany\u2019s controversial challenge in the Manchester derby last weekend, both have ankle injuries while Carrick limped out of that game with a tight calf and Rojo later reported a stomach muscle problem.

United\u2019s injury setback means that Luke Shaw and Radamel Falcao could both be recalled against Jose Mourinho\u2019s side. \u2018I have to tell that we have four injuries who played the last match so that\u2019s not so good for us,\u2019 said Van Gaal. \u2018We had very good hope that we should recover two of the four but it\u2019s not like that. Carrick is out and Rojo is out, but also Blind and Jones. \u2018That\u2019s the worst scenario because Rojo and Jones are good players at the left central defender position. Evans is suspended so we don\u2019t have many choices. Blind and Carrick could play the midfield holding position and I don\u2019t have any other option, or I have to play Wayne Rooney in that position again. I have to puzzle a lot for tomorrow. \u2018Other players can take profit of the momentum now. It\u2019s always like that. It\u2019s not special in the life of a manager or a team. \u2018You have seen that I took Jones off pitch (against Manchester City) because of injury, you have seen that Carrick was off the pitch, you have seen the tackle of Kompany against Blind. Only Rojo is a little bit surprising because he felt it the day after the match. \u2018It\u2019s because of the distance between the matches. Blind and Jones were very close to playing but it was not enough. \u2018Other players can take profit of the moment now. It\u2019s always like that.

It\u2019s more when and if, and I don\u2019t believe in when and if. I believe in facts. The fact is that we are behind Chelsea. \u2018But, alright, we have to play against them and so do Arsenal so we can lay pressure on Chelsea\u2019s shoulders. You never know, you\u2019ve seen it in previous Premier League seasons. So I cannot say it is not possible, but it is not logical. \u2018They play at home but I think that Chelsea will be satisfied with a draw. Of course they will want to beat Manchester United and we want to beat them, the question is how long players can play in the discipline. \u2018We live for these titles, we are doing this for that. The only satisfaction you have as a manager is when you win a title. When you are second or third you can play Champions League, but a title is more fixed for you and you have your name on it. That\u2019s why managers are fixated on titles. When you reach that goal you are happy. \u2018To be involved in the game with young people to reach a goal, that is also a goal of mine. That is why I\u2019m still a manager because I don\u2019t have to work anymore \u2013 you can count on that. I like to work with young people and help them in their career.\u2019 Robin van Persie (back right) has only been training with United for a week but may return to feature . Van Gaal gave a young Mourinho his break in coaching at Barcelona. Asked to compare the Portuguese with his current assistant Ryan Giggs, the United boss admitted that he has been surprised by the Old Trafford legend\u2019s work ethic. He said: \u2018It\u2019s always difficult. People compare with each other because Jose Mourinho was not the world-class player that Ryan Giggs was. So that\u2019s the same thing with me. I was not as world-class as, for example, Johann Cruyff yet our ambition is maybe then higher. \u2018But I have to admit that I could not imagine when I spoke with him (Giggs) in May or June to ask him to be my assistant manager and we spoke about how we saw it, that he works very hard. As an ex-player you are not used to working very hard and he is a very hard worker, and he reads the game very well like Jose.

By 2014, that number had climbed to 47%, according to a survey conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute. That's more than the 45% who said they opposed same-sex nuptials. The margin is small but statistically significant, said Robert P. Jones, CEO of PRRI, because of the exceptionally large pool of respondents: 40,000 adult Americans. (Eight percent refused to answer or said they didn't know their stance on same-sex marriage.) According to PRRI's poll, there are now more people of faith who favor marriage equality than stand against it, a dramatic turn in one of this country's most divisive debates and a generational shift with the potential to sweep through everything from the wedding industry to the 2016 presidential race. \"There's been a huge swing in the last decade,\" said Jones. \"There are now big, mainstream groups on both sides of the debate.\" If the U.S. Supreme Court has been paying attention, it likely saw this trend coming. Each time the high court has considered a case related to same-sex marriage, the pile of amicus briefs from religious groups supporting gay rights has inched a little taller, and the crowds protesting outside their grand marble steps has gradually grown more diverse. On Tuesday, for example, as the Supreme Court hears oral arguments in Obergefell v. Hodges, a case widely expected to produce a landmark ruling on same-sex marriage, an interfaith coalition of clergy led by the dean of Washington's National Cathedral is planning to march in support of LGBT rights. \"I join with many across the spectrum of American faith communities in my hope that the Court's ruling will permit same-sex marriage in all 50 states,\" the Very Rev. Gary Hall, the cathedral's dean, said in a statement. \"I trust that their judgment will end discrimination against those who seek God's blessing on their marriages.\" Clergy from Hall's religious denomination, the Episcopal Church, have also submitted an amicus brief in support of same-sex marriage. The brief is endorsed by nearly 2,000 faith leaders, including rabbis, Methodist ministers, Lutheran bishops, seminary professors and Congregationalist chaplains. Another brief, submitted by the Anti-Defamation League, is signed by Jewish, Hindu and Presbyterian groups. In a reverse of traditional arguments against gay marriage, some members of these groups say their religious rights will be curtailed if states do not allow them to perform same-sex nuptials. Prominent and powerful religious groups are lined up on the other side as well, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, National Association of Evangelicals, Southern Baptist Convention, Assemblies of God and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also known as the Mormon church. Together, leaders of these faiths represent more than 120 million Americans. But as PRRI's survey shows, there are often differences of opinion between the pulpits and the pews. Despite vocal opposition from the U.S. Catholic Bishops, for example, 60% of Catholics now favor same-sex marriage. That's a huge increase from 2003, when just 35% backed gay rights, according to survey conducted at the time by the Pew Research Center. Mainline Protestants -- so-called for their prominence in 20th century American life -- also saw a huge shift in the last decade. While 36% supported same-sex marriage in 2003, now 62% do. At a glance, the pro-gay marriage faction is now strikingly diverse, encompassing Buddhists, Catholics, Jews and Hindus. But the pro-traditional marriage crowd is just as motley, bridging black Protestants, Mormons, Muslims and white evangelicals, according to PRRI's survey. Same-sex marriage rights worldwide . Legalized nationwide:Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, South Africa, Sweden . Legalized in certain regions:Brazil, Mexico, United States . Civil unions or domestic partnerships:Andorra, Austria, Brazil, Colombia, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Greenland, Hungary, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Slovenia, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Uruguay and parts of Australia, Mexico, United States and Venezuela . The survey data comes from PRRI's American Values Atlas, conducted between April and December of last year. PRRI is a nonpartisan, nonprofit research group that focuses on faith and American culture. Separate surveys conducted by PRRI and other groups show much of the newfound religious support for same-sex marriage is coming from younger Americans. Seven in 10 Millennials, for example, support same-sex marriage and say that faith groups alienate young adults by being judgemental on sexual ethics. Half of millennial Republicans say gays and lesbians should be allowed to marry, and 43% of white evangelical millennials agree. Those numbers could put GOP presidential candidates in a tight spot, said Jones, as they try to expand their base and appeal to younger Americans. \"The real challenge for GOP candidates is how can they plant their feet deftly enough not to offend older conservatives in the primaries but still be able to pivot in the general election to a younger generation,\" Jones said. Politicians may pivot on same-sex marriage, but Bible-believing Christians should not -- even if public opinion turns against them, said Denny Burk, a professor at Boyce College, a Southern Baptist school in Louisville, Kentucky. \"For me, the number of people who come to the message is not the main issue. There are periods when the Gospel is popular and periods when it's not. You can't base your evaluation of its truthfulness on its popularity at a given historical moment.\" Still, Burk said he doesn't doubt that more millennials accept same-sex marriage, and he fully expects the Supreme Court to legalize gay weddings countrywide this June when the justices render a decision in Obergefell v. Hodges. But the fight is far from over, Burk said. \"Just like we've seen this decades-long culture war with abortion, we're going to see the same thing with gay marriage.\"", "reference": "There are now more people of faith who favor marriage equality than stand against it, according to a new poll .\nIf the U.S. Supreme Court has been paying attention, it likely saw this trend coming ."}, "138": {"id": "225f2330a6477e05fd3cebb31d3c87243cd40eb6", "article": "April 8, 2015 .

The 28-year-old, who is on loan to Everton, was reportedly interviewed by officers under caution over the alleged assault earlier this month. A teenage waitress claims England footballer Aaron Lennon (pictured playing for Everton) grabbed her, slapped her and ripped her top . After taking part in Everton's 1-0 win at home against Southampton on April 4, Lennon is thought to have headed to Suede nightclub in Manchester with friends. Lennon, who has 21 England caps, lives in a penthouse apartment in the city centre. That night, the venue, which is popular with Premier League footballers, was packed with hundreds who had come to see singer Trey Songz perform. But later in the evening, the waitress claimed to have been attacked by the player in the VIP section - where booths cost \u00a32,000. She was interviewed by Greater Manchester Police four days later. A source told\u00a0The Sun's\u00a0Michael Hamilton and Dean Wilkins that the girl, who is 'very pretty', had worked at the club for just under a year. He added that the footballer and his friends were 'spending a lot of money on drinks'.

'She came out about an hour later and was annoyed security had not done anything and kicked Lennon out. 'She says he grabbed her and ripped her top and then slapped her.'

Klim told DMA that there is a start contrast in her fitness and diet habits when she is in Australia versus her life at home in Bali. 'I exercise in Bali for two hours a day, but then when I'm in Australia I don't exercise at all,' she revealed, adding that in Australia she struggles to find the time in her schedule. 'My diet in Bali is a lot healthier in Bali than it is in Australia. It's so much easier to eat really healthy food there, it's all organic, locally grown food. 'We don't snack in Bali either - we don't have chips and lollies and things, so I find it a lot easier to eat over there.

Most people will pick out a phantom-like picture of Albert Einstein. But if you see a Hollywood pin-up, you may need a trip to the opticians. At normal viewing distance, healthy eyes should be able to pick up the fine lines on Einstein's face, causing the brain to disregard Marilyn Monroe's image altogether. Scroll down for video . The image was created by superimposing a blurry picture of Monroe over a picture of Albert Einstein drawn in fine lines. Features with a high spatial frequency (Einstein) are only visible when you're viewing them close up, and those with low spatial frequencies (Monroe) are only visible from further away. Combining pictures of the two produces a single image which changes when the viewer moves closer or farther away from the screen. This classic optical illusion was created several years ago by neuroscientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In a recent video,\u00a0AsapScience highlighted the process behind the trick, which can also be seen in a still image by anyone if they move closer and then farther away from the screen. \u2018Depending on how well you\u2019re able to focus or pick up contrast your eye will only pick out details,\u2019 the video explains. \u2018Up close, we\u2019re generally able to pick up fine details like Einstein\u2019s moustache and wrinkles. \u2018But as the distance increases, or if your vision is poor and creates a more blurred image in the first place, your ability to pick up details fades away. \u2018Instead you only see general features, like the shape of mouth, nose and hair, and are left seeing Marilyn Monroe. \u2018 . The MIT team, led by Dr Aude Oliva, has spent over a decade creating hybrid optical illusions that show how images can be hidden with textures, words and other objects. When you look at the image above, whose face do you see? At normal screen viewing distance you should see the face of Albert Einstein. Squint your eyes or take a few steps back from the image and Marilyn Monroe should come into view . 'Marilyn Einstein' was created by superimposing a blurry picture of Marilyn Monroe over a picture of Albert Einstein drawn in fine lines. Features with a high spatial frequency are only visible when viewing them close up, and those with low spatial frequencies are only visible at a distance. Combining pictures of the two produces a single image which changes when the viewer moves closer or farther away from the screen. Dr Oliva\u2019s group say these images not only reveal vision problems, but can also highlight how the brain processes information. In one study, participants were shown hybrid images for just of 30 milliseconds, and only recognised the low spatial resolution, or blurry, component of the image. On the top row, up close, you can see that the man on the left is scowling, while the woman on the right has a placid facial emotion. Move back, and the faces change expressions and even genders. If you squint, blink or defocus, the angry man turns calm, and the calm woman turns angry, and male . At normal viewing distance, you may see a dolphin. But disguised within the low spatial frequency of this hybrid is a car, which you will see once you step back a few metres . But when the images were shown for 150 milliseconds, they only recognised the image that was produced in fine detail, or in high spatial resolution. In a separate test, they were shown sad faces in high spatial resolution and angry faces in low spatial resolution. They superimposed pictures used both male and female faces. When displayed for 50 milliseconds, participants always saw an angry face, but were unable to pinpoint the sex of the person pictured. Dr Oliva says this shows that our brains discriminate between picking out fine detail in some situations, and broader detail in others. The brain\u2019s processing of fine details happens slightly later than processing other features, according to the research. The teams believes hybrid images such as this may prove useful to advertisers who want to change how their logos appear at different distances. It could also be used to mask text on devices so only someone viewing close up can read it. These images contain old fashioned maps of the distribution of cranial organs which can only be seen at close range to the image. At a distance, all that will be seen are two normal portraits . Hybrid images can create textures with viewing distance. This picture shows an example of a woman's face that turns into a cat at close distance .", "reference": "Look at the hybrid image at a normal viewing distance from the screen .\nIf the image of Einstein doesn't appear, it may mean you have bad vision .\nIllusion shows how we focus on different features depending on distance ."}, "142": {"id": "cc4b8927a1ce9a998668c782a43b964c80aa8b78", "article": "A 46-year-old man has been reported missing after a kayak he had taken out with his fiance capsized in choppy waters.

Nyia Parler cannot be extradited to face the charges in Philadelphia until she completes an unspecified \"treatment,\" Maryland police said Monday. When she does arrive, she will be charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, recklessly endangering another person and related offenses, in addition to the attempted murder count, O'Brien said. The Montgomery County (Maryland) Department of Police took Parler, 41, into custody Sunday after Philadelphia police reported that she left her 21-year-old son in the woods while she hopped a bus to see her boyfriend in Maryland. A man walking through the woods found him Friday \"lying in leaves, covered in a blanket with a Bible and a wheelchair nearby,\" Philadelphia police say. Citing federal health care privacy laws, Montgomery County police spokesman Capt. Paul Starks said he could not divulge why Parler was receiving treatment, but he said she had to complete it before she could be extradited. She remained in treatment as of Tuesday morning, Starks told CNN. If she chooses not to challenge her extradition, she will be transported to Philadelphia once the treatment is complete, he said. For more than four days, police say, the quadriplegic man, who also suffers from cerebral palsy, was left lying in the woods of Philadelphia's Cobbs Creek Park. Low temperatures reached the mid-30s during the week, and rain was reported in the area Wednesday and Thursday. The man is unable to communicate how he came to be in the park, but Philadelphia police Lt. John Walker told reporters that the man's mother left him there the morning of April 6. Starks identified the mother as Parler on Monday. \"The mother went to visit her boyfriend down in Maryland, over in Montgomery County, and we believe she placed the child into Cobbs Creeks Park,\" Walker said at a news conference. Walker told CNN the man was transported to Presbyterian Hospital, but CNN affiliates reported he was being treated at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He suffered eye problems, dehydration, malnutrition and a cut to his back that raised infection concerns, the lieutenant told reporters. \"This kid's obviously a fighter,\" Walker said during a Saturday news conference. \"It's just unbelievable how we found him out there last night. To see that kid laying there, it's heartbreaking to see another human, especially a mother, can treat someone like that.\" Officials at Philadelphia's School of the Future, which the man attends, became concerned when he didn't show up for classes last week and tried to contact his mother but eventually reached an aunt, Philadelphia police said. \"The aunt was in contact via text message with Nyia throughout the week and when she expressed her concerns about the complainant, Nyia replied, 'We're OK,' which the aunt believed meant that the victim was with Nyia in Maryland,\" according to a police news release. When police tracked down the mother, she told them her son was with her, Walker said. \"She indicated to both family members and the police officers that the child was with her down with her boyfriend in Maryland,\" he said. The boyfriend was not aware of what happened, Walker told CNN affiliate KYW-TV. Walker told reporters she bore \"clear criminal liability in this case.\" There was no reason for the man to suffer, Walker told philly.com, because the mother had sisters willing to take care of him. Two of his aunts, who have tried to obtain guardianship of him, were staying with him at the hospital, police told the website. Parler's sister told police that Parler has another child, a 16-year-old. The mother's arrest was only the beginning of the investigation, Walker told reporters.

After all, the actor was serious when he recently told Variety \"It will probably win best picture at the Oscars, unless the Oscars don't want to be relevant ever.\" But rather than ignore it because it's a glossy, blockbuster action film, some might argue that the movie goes against type for Academy Award nominated films because the cast is so diverse. \"Furious 7\" hits theaters Friday, months after controversy was stirred about the lack of diversity at the Oscars. There were no actors of color nominated and no women in the directing category, which was dominated by white males. Mexican filmmaker Alejandro Gonzalez I\u00f1arritu went on to win best director for \"Birdman.\" The lack of diversity was so glaring (even with the mostly black cast of the movie \"Selma,\" which received a nomination for best picture) that it spurred the Twitter hashtag \"#OscarsSoWhite.\" In contrast, \"Furious 7\" couldn't be more racially and ethnically inclusive. The cast includes Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson -- a Samoan/black man -- black actors Christopher \"Ludacris\" Bridges and Tyrese Gibson, Hispanic performer Michelle Rodriguez, Thai martial artist Tony Jaa, Beninese expatriate Djimon Hounsou and the late Paul Walker, a blue-eyed, blond-haired California native. The filmmakers even went so far as to make sure casting directors in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, where key scenes were filmed, found diverse extras. \"We were mainly looking for the diverse look of the (United Arab Emirates),\" Miranda Davidson, owner of the casting company, told The National. \"They really wanted to make sure we reflected the international feel of the country.\" Almost since the beginning, the \"Fast and Furious\" films have had a diverse focus and appeal.  The band of street racers, which encompassed white, black, Asian, Hispanic, male and female and bond as a family, has done well at the box office with each iteration. In 2011, then Boston Globe film critic Wesley Morris wrote, \"Go on and laugh your Benetton, Kumbaya, Kashi, quinoa laugh, but it's true: The most progressive force in Hollywood today is the 'Fast and Furious' movies.\" \"They're loud, ludicrous, and visually incoherent,\" he said. \"They're also the last bunch of movies you'd expect to see in the same sentence as 'incredibly important.' But they are -- if only because they feature race as a fact of life as opposed to a social problem or an occasion for self-congratulation. (And this doesn't even account for the gay tension between the male leads, and the occasional crypto-lesbian make-out.)\" According to the Motion Picture Association of America's 2014 Theatrical Market Statistics Report, while Hispanics make up 17% of the U.S. population they account for 25% of frequent moviegoers. Likewise, women make up 52% of moviegoers. Entertainment Weekly points out that the film franchise is doing a much better job of reflecting its audience than others in Hollywood. \"Despite the films' cumulative worldwide gross of almost $2.4 billion, their racial inclusiveness remains an outlier; American movies are still overwhelmingly white,\" EW's Chris Lee writes. \"According to UCLA's 2015 Hollywood Diversity Report, a mere 16.7% of 2013 films starred minorities in lead roles.\" At least one moviegoer tweeted that he appreciated the effort. Diesel told EW the franchise has come a long way from the original 2001 film, which featured segregated gangs of racers pitted against each other. \"It doesn't matter what nationality you are,\" the star said. \"As a member of the audience, you realize you can be a member of that 'family.'

Buhari said he'll \"rapidly give attention\" to curbing violence in the northeast part of Nigeria, where the terrorist group Boko Haram operates. By cooperating with neighboring nations Chad, Cameroon and Niger, he said his administration is confident it will be able to thwart criminals and others contributing to Nigeria's instability. For the first time in Nigeria's history, the opposition defeated the ruling party in democratic elections. Buhari defeated incumbent Goodluck Jonathan by about 2 million votes, according to Nigeria's Independent National Electoral Commission. The win comes after a long history of military rule, coups and botched attempts at democracy in Africa's most populous nation. In an exclusive live interview from Abuja, Buhari told Amanpour he was not concerned about reconciling the nation after a divisive campaign. He said now that he has been elected he will turn his focus to Boko Haram and \"plug holes\" in the \"corruption infrastructure\" in the country. \"A new day and a new Nigeria are upon us,\" Buhari said after his win Tuesday. \"The victory is yours, and the glory is that of our nation.\" Earlier, Jonathan phoned Buhari to concede defeat. The outgoing president also offered a written statement to his nation. \"I thank all Nigerians once again for the great opportunity I was given to lead this country, and assure you that I will continue to do my best at the helm of national affairs until the end of my tenure,\" Jonathan said. \"I promised the country free and fair elections. I have kept my word.\" Buhari, 72, will be sworn in on May 29. He will take the helm at a critical time, as Nigeria grapples with Boko Haram, serious economic woes and corruption. This isn't Buhari's first time leading Nigeria, but it's his first time in nearly 30 years. A military coup brought Buhari to power in late 1983, closing a brief period of popular rule by Shehu Shagari. But Buhari himself was ousted by another military coup in August 1985.

Buhari praised voters for exercising their right peacefully. \"Your vote affirms that you believe Nigeria's future can be better than what it is today,\" he said in his statement. \"You voted for change, and now change has come.\" Buhari campaigned as a born-again democrat to allay fears about his strict military regime. He stressed that Nigeria's security needs to be the next government's focus. His campaign was also fiercely anti-corruption. He ran under the slogan of \"new broom,\" and his supporters were often pictured holding brooms in the lead-up to the vote. Despite years of democracy, analysts say, corruption has hindered Nigeria from building a stable economy. One of Buhari's biggest challenges will be Boko Haram, which has been terrorizing Nigeria as it tries to institute a strict version of Sharia law in the country. In the past few years, the terror group has bombed churches and mosques, killed hundreds of people and kidnapped more than 200 teenage girls from a boarding school. Even the presidential vote had to be postponed because of the radical militants. The election was originally scheduled for February 14, but was delayed six weeks because the military needed more time to secure areas controlled by Boko Haram. Yet the violence persisted. On Saturday, residents in the northeastern state of Gombe said at least 11 people were killed in attacks at polling stations, apparently by Boko Haram extremists. Jonathan had been criticized for not doing enough to combat Boko Haram. Before the election, African affairs analyst Ayo Johnson said the vote would come down to who could make Nigeria feel safe. \"Many Nigerians will not forget (Buhari) was a military leader during a dictatorship,\" Johnson said. \"Or maybe they will feel that they need a military leader to address fundamental problems such as terrorism.\" Boko Haram isn't the only obstacle facing the new president. The economy is another major issue. Nigeria overtook South Africa last year as the region's largest economy. Nigeria is one of Africa's largest oil producers and is a major supplier of crude oil to the United States. It also hosts many international oil companies and workers. But many complain that the country's vast wealth from oil exports doesn't trickle down to the average citizen. As many as 70% of Nigerians live below the poverty line, surviving on less than a dollar a day. Christian Purefoy reported from Lagos; Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta.

But one Russian YouTuber captured the terrifying moment a stream of soil flowed down a bank next to a main road, crushing trees in its powerful path and leaving toppled power lines in its wake. The eerie phenomenon is called an 'earthflow' and is a rare type of landslide.

In the video, snow-covered soil can be seen sliding down the bank at the side of a road, which is thought to run between Novokuznetsk and Bolshaya Talda. The earthflow also blocked nearby railroad tracks  and caused power outages, but no one was hurt. Commenting on the post, a user called Michal said: \u2018The landslide looks like it may have come from a large coal mine area.' Alexander Giniyatullin kept a remarkably steady hand filming the scary scene in the Kemerovo Region of Russia (shown by the red marker), which is thought to have happened at 1pm on April 1 . An earthflow is a type of landslide. It's a viscous flow of fine-grained materials, such as clay, sand and silt that have been saturated with water and moves downhill because of the pull of gravity. As the earthflow moves down a slope, it remains covered with any vegetation and typically leaves a bowl-shaped depression behind. Earthflows usually begin in a large basin on the upper part of a slope where debris and weathered material accumulate. They are usually triggered by heavy rainfall, so that when the debris becomes saturated with enough water, it starts flowing downhill. The speed of an earthflow can vary depending on the amount of water present and the angle of the slope and varies from 0.11 to 12.4 mph (0.17 to 20 km/h). As the earthflow gathers momentum, it can be seen crushing trees in its path, and the sound of crumbling soil and splintering wood can be heard in the video. The cameraman backs away as the material eerily creeps across the width of the road, where he was previously standing and it seems to spread along the bank at a walking pace. An earthflow is a viscous flow of fine-grained materials, such as clay, sand and silt that have been saturated with water and moves downhill because of the pull of gravity.

It is slower than a mud flow, which can cover villages beneath mud in minutes.

Research suggests that rockfall son Mont Blanc (pictured) are caused by warming temperatures . Climbers have long suspected that hotter summers trigger rockfalls on the slopes of Mont Blanc in the French Alps. Now a study of 533 rockfalls reported by climbers or spotted on satellite images of the mountain since 2003, has bolstered the opinion that climate change is making popular routes up Europe's highest mountain more treacherous. Ludovic Ranavel of the University of Savoie at Le Bourget-du-Lac in the Alps, spotted a strong correlation between the number of rockfalls and air and rock temperatures on the slopes, New Scientist reported. He thinks that melting permafrost may be to blame, because it loosens rocks that were held in place with ice, causing them to fall. The expert revealed that 95 per cent of rockfalls around the mountain occur during between June and September - the hottest months of the year. Most begin in areas 10,170ft (3,100 metres) above sea level, close to the zone containing perma ice, he told the European Geosciences Union's general assembly in Vienna. As the Alps get hotter, the zone is thought to be receding, creating more rockfalls than before. They are usually triggered by heavy rainfall, so that when the debris becomes saturated with enough water, it starts flowing downhill. The video shows a stream of water running down the road as the debris falls down the slope, indicating the mass of soil is waterlogged. The speed of an earthflow can vary depending on the amount of water present and the angle of the slope, varying from being barely noticeable to relatively rapid, as seen in the video when a road becomes completely blocked in a matter of minutes. Experts at San Diego State University said speeds can range from 0.11 to 12.4 mph (0.17 to 20 km/h). In fact, it can take minutes or years for material to move down slops and earthflows can affect anything from a few metres of land, to several hectares. In the video, the flow of debris is quite fast and it\u2019s possible to see industrial equipment toppled at the top of the slope, while trees are crushed beneath the moving earth and what appear to be power lines and pylons pulled down and dragged along by the moving mass of earth. The movement seems to speed up as the cameraman beats a hasty retreat down the road. When he pans back along the way he has come, the road is completely blocked by a debris that looks as if it is between one and two storeys high in places. Towards the end of the footage, the speed of the earthflow seems to decline, but it continues to creep across the road, to completely cross it.", "reference": "Eerie earthflow was\u00a0captured\u00a0in\u00a0the Kemerovo Region of Russia .\nIt left a wide path of destruction, toppling pylons and\u00a0crushing\u00a0trees .\nEarthflows can vary in speed from barely detectable to 12 mph (20km/h)\nThey are a form of landslide where fine soil or sand becomes waterlogged ."}, "158": {"id": "66446280bec4f20b1c9cf2676b5ca0b31b999669", "article": "Alarmed by a rash of explosions and injuries caused when amateurs make hash oil, lawmakers in Colorado and Washington are considering spelling out what's allowed when it comes to making the concentrated marijuana at home. The proposals came after an increase in home fires and blasts linked to homemade hash oil. In Colorado, at least 30 people were injured last year in 32 butane explosions involving hash oil \u2014 nearly three times the number reported throughout 2013, according to officials with the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, a state-federal enforcement program. Scroll down for video . Nicholas Broms, who was involved in a drug-related explosion last November, poses for a photo showing his burn scars from the explosion in Portland, Ore. Washington's legal marijuana law in 2012 did not permit the production of hash or even edibles at home; it technically remains a felony even to use weed purchased at a state-licensed store to make brownies. Nevertheless, many people have done it. Federal prosecutors in Seattle have brought charges in five cases where hash oil operations blew up, including at one apartment complex where an 87-year-old former mayor of Bellevue died after sustaining an injury while trying to escape a fire that started in another unit. People make hash oil at home for the same reasons they make beer, wine or booze \u2014 to save money, make it to personal taste, or as a hobby. Though there are safer methods, such as soaking marijuana in a vegetable-based glycerin, one common practice is to force a solvent such as butane or propane gas or liquid through leafy cannabis, a process that separates its psychoactive material from buds, leaves and stems. After the extraction, the hash-maker then releases the gas or boils off the liquid, leaving behind marijuana's psychoactive material in a potent goop. The resulting product \u2014 called hash oil or shatter or wax in even more concentrated form \u2014 can be used in vaporizers or added to foods without the grassy taste raw pot imparts. Without proper ventilation, though, the gases can pool in a room, where a spark from an appliance can trigger a severe explosion, knocking buildings off their foundation in some cases. Washington lawmakers are proposing to allow limited home hash production, though butane or other explosive gases would be banned except for use by commercial producers. Safer methods would be OK, and adults would be allowed to use cooking oil, butter or similar substances to make edibles. Alarmed by a rash of explosions caused by amateur hash production, Colorado and Washington lawmakers are considering limits on making the marijuana concentrate at home . 'We have a little problem here with people blowing themselves up,' said Washington state Sen. Ann Rivers, the Republican sponsor of that state's measure. 'Anything we can do to stop that from happening.' In Colorado, where hash regulations vary by jurisdiction, a bill up for its first vote next week in a House committee would establish a similar ban on the use of explosive gases to make hash. 'People who make it at home, they can do so with alcohol or methods that are safe,' said Colorado state Rep. Yeulin Willett, a sponsor of the bill. Colorado's largest jurisdiction, Denver, banned some types of home hash production late last year. A similar ban is under discussion in the state's third-largest city, Aurora. But some marijuana activists argue that when pot is legal, concentrating it at home should be legal, too. They compare the hash explosions to fires caused by turkey fryers and call it a problem with a new product that is best addressed by consumer education. 'Sure, there have been numerous dangerous explosions and fires from idiots who are determined to blow themselves up participating in activities which need considerable safety precautions,' said Timothy Tipton of the Rocky Mountain Caregivers Cooperative. Tipton insisted that butane extraction is perfectly safe with proper ventilation or when done outside. Supporters of home production also say Colorado's law is on their side. The state's marijuana legalization measure specifically included concentrated marijuana and all its production methods. This photo released Wednesday, May 21, 2014, by the Central Pierce Fire and Rescue, shows debris following an explosion the night before in Puyallup, Wash. when hundreds of butane canisters exploded . Just last month, the Denver district attorney dropped a case against a man facing felony charges of manufacturing marijuana concentrate and fourth-degree arson. The man, Paul Mannaioni, was charged last year after a hash oil explosion sent him and two other people to a hospital. Mannaioni challenged the legality of Denver's hash oil ban, prompting Colorado's former attorney general to say the marijuana amendment allows limits on home production. The charges were later dismissed after prosecutors said they couldn't tie him to the explosion beyond a reasonable doubt, leaving the legality of the city's hash oil ban unresolved. Some marijuana advocates said a statewide ban would invite more legal challenges. 'It's a patient's right to make their medicine,' said Jason Warf of the Southern Colorado Cannabis Council. But Colorado lawmakers backing the homemade limits said the state should err on the side of caution. 'This is something we need to nip in the bud,' Willett said.", "reference": "Lawmakers in Colorado and Washington are considering spelling out what's allowed when it comes to making the concentrated marijuana at home .\nAt least 30 were injured in Colorado alone in 2014 in butane explosions involving hash oil .\nPeople make hash oil at home to save money, make it to personal taste, or as a hobby ."}, "159": {"id": "dbce61d253b9e770529817b484aeb8b0cca76a73", "article": "(CNN)A family trip to a Nebraska zoo turned terrifying for one family after the gorilla they were looking at leaped toward the exhibit window, cracking it.

He also drove young children to his 'hideout' in the woods where he allegedly forced them to perform sexual acts on him and raped them. Parents even let their children sleep over at his apartment. The Tampa Bay Times\u00a0reports that Shepard, who has a history of molesting children dating back 20 years, served 15 years in prison for molesting two boys, age six and nine, at a roller rink in 1998. As his term in prison neared its end, authorities filed petitions to keep him locked up under the Jimmy Ryce Act, a Florida law that allows sex offenders to be kept behind bars past their sentences if they're likely to re-offend. Shepard posted these sex offender notifications around his apartment complex, but told parents he was convicted of sleeping with a preacher's teenage daughter . Parents soon began to trust Shepard and even let him babysit their kids, authorities say . Two psychologists examined Shepard and found that he wasn't likely molest children again after his release, the Times reports. Dr Karen C. Parker testified on behalf of Shepard at a hearing. Dr\u00a0Martin Falb, the state's expert, diagnosed him with\u00a0pedophilia, depressive disorder and adult antisocial behavior. He said Shepard was likely to re-offend. But at a hearing, he said he was 'straddling the fence' on whether Shepard should be kept locked up or be released, according to the Times. According to the newspaper, Shepard had been caught having sex with other inmates in prison and had a confrontation with his live-in lover, his step-brother, after his release. When he  moved into Cedar Hollow, he was required to post flyers to his neighbors informing him that he was a convicted sex offender. He still managed to win the trust of parents in the neighborhood. Within a month, a young boy was allowed to spend the night with him.

The hosts made a number of changes from the side that lost 25-18 at Leicester in the Premiership last weekend with McGuigan, Ben Moon, Tomas Francis and Tom James being drafted in. The Chiefs were also forced into a late change with Damian Welch pulling-up in the warm-up so Ben White was promoted from the bench to play in the back row, skipper Mumm moved into the second row and Sam Skinner added to the replacements. Newcastle, who lost 46-17 to Exeter in the Premiership last month, started with two changes in the backs from the side that narrowly lost at London Irish with Juan Pablo Socino in the centre and Harris on the right wing. Both defences were tested in the opening 10 minutes but it was Exeter who made the first breakthrough just before the quarter-hour. Dave Ewers of Exeter Chiefs (centre) makes a break during his side's 48-13 victory against the Falcons . After the Falcons were forced to touch down over their own line, Exeter broke off the back of the five-metre scrum and Ewers barged over the line. Slade added the extras from out wide on the right and the Chiefs were under way. Exeter increased their advantage midway through the half when wing Matt Jess, who was on course to score from a loose ball, was pulled back twice off the ball by full-back Alex Tait. Referee Marius Mitrea had no hesitation in awarding a penalty try - which Slade converted - and Tait went to the sin-bin. Newcastle kept the Chiefs at bay while they were a man down and when they were back to full strength the visitors were awarded a penalty 12 metres out in front of the posts, which fly-half Catterick slotted over to get his side off the mark. Slade and Catterick then swapped penalties to leave Exeter with an 11-point lead at the interval. Dan Temm of Newcastle Falcons tackles Thomas Waldrom during the quarter-final encounter . That soon became 18 points as just 45 seconds after the restart Ewers broke from inside his own half, shrugged off a couple of half tackles, before offloading to number eight Waldrom to stretch for the line. Slade converted and, 12 minutes later, added his second penalty from 30 metres out to make it 27-6. The Chiefs' fourth try came just before the hour-mark when Will Chudley chipped over the head of the defence and into the arms of McGuigan to go over, with Slade again adding the conversion. The Falcons may have looked down and out but Harris rounded a couple of forwards to score a breakaway try under the posts with Catterick converting to cut the deficit to 34-13.

McCall has put Rangers in the driving seat for second place in the Scottish Championship and a place in the semi-finals of the play-offs after taking over from reluctant caretaker Kenny McDowall. McCoist was put on gardening leave just before Christmas after handing in his notice following three-and-a-half difficult seasons in charge under the chaotic reigns of the likes of Craig Whyte and then Charles Green and his allies. But his failure to win a cup competition and his team's style of play drew serious criticism. Walter Smith (right)\u00a0spent two spells in charge as manager of Rangers and has hailed Stuart McCall's impact . Smith (right) attended a John Hartson Foundation golf day to raise money for testicular cancer awareness . Smith was chairman for some of that period after accepting Green's offer to join the board - a decision he soon regretted - and insists the club was too badly run to ensure true success on the park. Smith, who was attending a John Hartson Foundation golf day to help raise money for testicular cancer awareness, said: 'The guys worked with me for four-and-a-half years there and did a great job for the club, and I was hoping they would get a good opportunity. 'I got great support from Sir David Murray but it's not turned out that they have had the same support from the people who have been running the club. So it has been very difficult for them to show what they can do. 'That's the crux of the matter, it's the circumstances they have been in that have caused them as much trouble as anything else. 'I'd be very surprised if anybody could show me a club that isn't well run, that are doing really well. 'The problems have been well documented and now they have got to concentrate on doing what they do, and that's Rangers getting back to the Premiership first and foremost and then trying to settle into a position where they can get back to being a winning team.' McCall played under Smith for seven seasons, winning six titles in the process, and the 67-year-old was pleased to see the former Motherwell boss take over, despite his pain at the exits of former assistants McCoist and McDowall. McCall was appointed Rangers manager in March until the summer as a replacement for Kenny McDowall . 'I'm not happy to see it because it cost friends of mine their job,' he said. 'But that happens in football and when other people take over I am obviously pleased to see Stuart take over and I hope he does really well. 'He has been brave enough to take the job until the end of the season. If he gets promotion, he will put himself in a very good position to get the job on a more permanent basis. 'He has gone in there and got a reaction. That happens in football. It has happened to me and a whole load of other managers, when you leave and someone else comes in, they get a reaction. Rangers have won five out of nine Scottish Championship matches since McCall's arrival at Ibrox . 'Performances have been brighter and hopefully he will keep that going until the end of the season.' However, Smith has warned that Rangers fans might have to be patient in their desire to see the club competing at the very top of Scottish football, despite power now lying in the hands of the likes of Paul Murray and Dave King following last month's general meeting. 'I'm obviously happy to see everything at the club settling down,' the former Scotland boss said. 'The lack of headlines would indicate that's the case. 'The people that are running the club are just getting their feet under the table and finding out what they have to do to move the club forward. I think that's to be expected at this stage. Smith did, however, open up about Ally McCoist's departure and admitted it wasn't easy to see . 'It will obviously take a bit of time but they will be able to handle that aspect of it. Everyone who is there now is there for the football club and that's a big, big thing. 'To be fair, when I was involved on the Rangers board, it would have been different from any other boardroom never mind anything else.

With a heavy schedule in mind, the Hoops boss returned midfielder Nir Bitton, Gary Mackay-Steven and striker John Guidetti his starting line-up. Thistle manager Alan Archibald was forced into one change with forward Kallum Higginbotham coming in for the injured Kris Doolan but he was mostly a spectator as the Firhill defence was forced to withstand an early Hoops' barrage. Celtic came close twice before two minutes had elapsed. Stefan Johansen doubles Celtic's advantage in the 63rd minute with left-footed shot into the bottom corner . Johansen is mobbed by his team-mates following his second-half strike . Parkhead defender Virgil van Dijk, up for a corner, flicked an Armstrong cross against the crossbar at the near post before a desperate blocking tackle by Maryhill defender Conrad Balatoni prevented an almost certain goal from Johansen's drive. Balatoni again came to Thistle rescue in the ninth minute, beating Guidetti to a header in front of an empty goal, after left-back Emilio Izaguirre had troubled Fox after surging into the penalty area. Moments later, Mackay-Steven was set up Johansen but his goalbound drive from 12 yards was deflected away by Thistle defender Callum Booth. Yet, in the 21st minute, in a rare attack, the visitors almost snatched the lead but Higginbotham's spectacular volley from 14 yards was saved by Craig Gordon - but only on the stretch. Commons' long-distance drive in the 28th minute just cleared the bar but a minute before the break he was more accurate from the spot, firing the penalty low into the corner giving the despairing Fox no chance.

Two minutes after the break Commons forced Fox into a decent save with a powerful 25-yard drive and while the Maryhill defence cleared their lines from rebound it looked ominous. Thistle continued to defend stoutly and desperately in equal measures but were undone again when Johansen took a clever Guidetti pass before rolling the ball into the corner of the net from 10 yards.

'As a result of General Motor\u2019s bankruptcy declaration in 2009, what foreign government became one of its largest shareholders?' Even after using two of her lifelines to narrow down the answer, McElroy answered China, which was incorrect. The correct answer was Canada. She walked away with around $5,000.

She opened the appearance by sharing an anecdote with Vieira about having to scramble to find a babysitter after being informed she was chosen to be on Millionaire jsut two days prior to taping.

The message read: 'As you may be aware, some students erroneously received an email this morning directing them to a... post that included some inappropriate material. 'We take this matter seriously and apologize for any upset it may have caused.' The university says federal law requires it investigate all reports of inappropriate behaviors of a sexual nature.

The song can\u2019t be identified and doesn\u2019t fit the pattern of noise generated by the few known species of beaked whale, raising hopes that it could be coming from a completely new species. While beaked whales make up the second largest family of cetaceans, relatively little is known about them, mainly because they spend very little time on the water\u2019s surface. Experts are sure the noise isn\u2019t made by Arnoux's beaked whales or Cuvier's beaked whales (stock image), because the signal doesn\u2019t match . There are 22 species of beaked whale and all of them are elusive deep divers, meaning that they are most often identified by their songs, which they use to navigate. The mysterious \u2018Antarctic BW29 signal was recorded near the Orkney Islands, South Shetland Islands, and Antarctic Peninsula by scientists led by Jennifer Trickey of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, at the University of California, in La Jolla, California. They have recorded the noise more than 1,000 times to conclude that it\u2019s unique in the composition of sounds making the signal and in timing,\u00a0BBC Earth reported. \u2018Given that new species of beaked whale are still being discovered, the source of these Antarctic signals might be a species that has yet to be identified,\u2019 the study says. But the song belong to a strap-toothed whale, a southern bottlenosed whale or a Gray\u2019s beaked whale (pictured), according to the study, despite the sound being the wrong frequency for a Gray\u2019s beaked whale . Whale sounds are used by whales for different kinds of communication. The word 'song' is used to describe the pattern of regular and predictable sounds made by some species of whales. Only males 'sing'. While the complex sounds of the humpback whale and some blue whales are believed to be primarily used in sexual selection, all whales use simpler sounds all year round to communicate. Whales occupying the same geographical areas, which can be vast, tend to sing similar songs with only small variations. Male humpback whales have been described as 'inveterate composers' of songs and experts have said that their songs are similar to human music in many ways. Experts are sure the noise isn\u2019t made by Arnoux's beaked whales or Cuvier's beaked whales, because the signal doesn\u2019t match their songs. But it could belong to a strap-toothed whale, a southern bottlenosed whale or a Gray\u2019s beaked whale, according to the study, published in the Journal of Marine Mammal Science. It is very rare for strap-toothed wakes to be sighted as far south as the noises have been heard, while the noise is the wrong frequency for a Gray\u2019s beaked whale, leaving the southern bottlenosed whale as the most likely match. But again there\u2019s a problem, because the whale\u2019s relative, the northern bottlenose whale, makes very different calls, leading experts to think that the southern species probably vocalises in a similar way \u2013 unlike the Antarctic BW29 signal. Experts have also recorded an \u2018Antarctic BW37\u2019 signal on six occasions, which is of a higher frequency. \u2018It remains unknown whether this belongs to a different beaked whale species than the one producing Antarctic BW29,\u2019 they write. Because frequency is usually linked to a whale\u2019s size, there is a theory that the Antarctic BW29 song may be made by a southern bottlenose whale, while the higher pitched Antarctic BW37 song could be made by a smaller Gray\u2019s beaked whale. There\u2019s also a chance that new species of whale could sing at different frequencies, but this ability would be unique among beaked whale species. Last year, a study revealed that the shy Cuvier's beaked whale performs the deepest dives made by any mammal on the planet at 9,816ft (2,992metres) below the waves - the equivalent of just under seven Empire State Buildings - and stays below for 138 minutes . A study published last April has revealed that the shy Cuvier\u2019s beaked whale performs the deepest dives made by any mammal on the planet. Scientists were surprised to record one of the mammal's dives, which was 9,816ft (2,992 metres) below the waves. And the whale stayed up to two miles below - around the depth of just under seven Empire State Buildings on top of one another - for 138 minutes. The New York landmark measures 1,250ft (381 metres) in height, excluding its tip. It is the first time that the diving behaviour of the species has been carefully examined and scientists are particularly interested in them because of the suspected effects of sonar - a system using transmitted and reflected underwater sound waves to detect and locate submerged objects.

Promoter Bob Arum (left), with Pacquiao and Roach after the 2009 win over Miguel Cotto, rates Khan highly . Floyd Jnr seems to have no great appetite for a second edition of May 2nd, even though a return bout might bank the man who nicknames himself Money another couple of hundred million dollars. Either way, Mayweather will conclude his enriching six-fight contract with the Showtime cable network in America in September. That timing rules out Khan as his opponent - yet again after two broken promises - because his strict observance of Ramadan would not end in time for him to prepare fully. But if it\u2019s not a re-match and Mayweather finds another opponent, Pacquiao-Khan is a natural for both of them. Pacquiao prefers an early winter date for his second fight of a year and Khan says: \u2018Late November or December is perfect for me.\u2019 Furthermore, it is highly unlikely that if Mayweather beats Pacquiao he will want to risk his cherished unbeaten record for a second time against the most dangerous of all his opponents. Floyd Mayweather will end his six-fight deal with Showtime in September, which won't work for Khan . Pacquiao works out with trainer Freddie Roach at their base at Wild Card Boxing in Los Angeles . And Khan suspects that will be the upshot in Vegas: \u2018I actually think that once Mayweather gets through Manny\u2019s assault in the first few rounds it will become an easy win for him. \u2018Manny has speed and power but Floyd has the defensive skill to avoid him and the brain and accuracy to keep picking him off as he comes in. \u2018The longer it goes the harder it will get for Manny and if he is to win he will have to keep up the pace through every minute of every round.\u2019 Khan has affection as well as respect for his old spar-mate, so it puts him in a curious position to realise that defeat for his pal would benefit himself. Khan believes Pacquiao will struggle more with Mayweather the longer their mega-fight goes on . So he says: \u2018I\u2019ll just watch it with a professional eye. And there is a chance that if Floyd\u2019s legs really are slowing down that Manny will catch up with him - and he can punch.\u2019 By way of further irony, Khan has been working lately to add to his high-speed aggression exactly the kind of patience he would need if he ever did fight Mayweather. Hidden away in a unit in a business park in Oakland, across the Bay from San Francisco, is the gym in which trainer Virgil Hunter hones the talents of Khan and his long-time protege Andre Ward, who will shortly make his own comeback from a long lay-off. Khan has to first overcome Chris Algieri (left), who was decked six time by Pacquiao, on May 29 in New York . But as his higher education continues under Hunter, he is buckling down. Partly in the knowledge, at 28, that these are his prime years and they must not be squandered. He says: \u2018I\u2019ve wasted the best part of a couple of years waiting for Floyd because I would love to be the man who beat the man considered the best pound-for-pound in the world. Now I have to make the most of every day because soon it may be too late. \u2018Floyd and Manny are getting closer to retirement and if I don\u2019t fight one of them soon it may never happen.\u2019 That is one of the reasons why Khan puts on hold a Battle of Britain with Kell Brook, preferring to focus on selling himself in America and thereby stay at the front of the queue for a shot at Pacquiao or Mayweather. Kell Brook (left) is fighting Frankie Gavin (right) in the 02 Arena and Khan says he has to wait to face him . Does his May 29 fight with Algieri - recently floored six times by Pacquiao in Macao - help that crusade? \u2018Algieri\u2019s a better fighter than Frankie Gavin (Brook\u2019s world title challenger next month). He\u2019s world lightweight champion and he\u2019s fought at a far higher level than Frankie. Kell can wait.\u2019 Khan says: \u2018Being at ringside (on May 2) will be a bit frustrating but I accept that this is the fight the whole world has been waiting to see. So no. I won\u2019t be feeling any resentment.\u2019 It is not much more than a half-hour\u2019s flight from Oakland to Vegas.

The plague, which famously killed millions of Europeans during the Black Death, is most commonly carried by fleas and rodents. Prairie dog deaths at Picture Canyon in Arizona alerted officials to the possibility of an outbreak. Parasitic insects from the preserve near a water treatment plant in Flagstaff were found to carry the illness. Scroll down for video . Authorities near Flagstaff, Arizona, have found fleas infected with plague after prairie dogs in Picture Canyon began dying (file photos) The plague, which killed millions of Europeans in the 1300s, causes pustules on the skin and is still contracted by 2,000 people a year (file photo) Human cases have developed from close contact with cats who have preyed on infected vermin and  residents in the Southwest have been warned about dangers of the disease while camping. The Southwestern US is similar to the plains of Central Asia where plague began, Professor David Wagner of Northern Arizona University told the Arizona Daily Sun. Plague is still contracted by as many as 2,000 people a year, according to the World Health Organization, though the vast majority of cases are in sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar. Prairie dogs are particularly susceptible to illness because they live in social burrows, and 90 per cent of the furry creatures' colony can eventually be wiped out if plague infects one member. The disease's rodent host dies, when fleas will look for more blood to drink, including from people. The vast majority of human plague cases reported in the US are in the arid climate of the Southwest, which scientists say is similar to the disease's homeland of Central Asia . The discovery of the disease at Picture Canyon (pictured) has prompted a warning from authorities about the dangers posed by dead rodents . Insecticide has been sprayed in prairie dog burrows in Picture Canyon to halt the plague's spread. Symptoms of pain in humans include fever, chills and muscle pain. At later stages it causes gangrene and a large amount of pustules, or buboes, on the skin. The incubation period could be up to seven days. Modern medications are effective in fighting the plague, also known by its bacterial name Yersinia pestis, \u00a0though it can be deadly if left untreated. The last plague epidemic in the United States was in Los Angeles between 1924 and 1925, according to the\u00a0Centers for Disease Control.

Julie Robert, a cultural studies professor at the University of Technology Sydney, said it was 'problematic' that the Prime Minister, who she believes should be advocating against binge drinking, thought it acceptable to 'showcase his masculinity' by skolling a beer. \u2018It sets up a culture that drinking isn\u2019t about socialising with friends, it\u2019s about how quickly and how much you can drink,\u2019 she said.

It took the Prime Minister about six seconds to down the schooner as players cheered and chanted 'skol' and 'Tony'. Dr Robert warned people can forget their limits when they are wrapped up in the act of demonstrating how much, or how quickly, they can drink. 'It is the whole performance and the display and showing off which is the problematic part,' she told Daily Mail Australia. However, she said it was not just Mr Abbott's skol that was concerning, it was also the way media and other government officials have reacted to the event. In an interview on Sunday, opposition leader Bill Shorten quipped that he was 'just pleased that Tony Abbott\u2019s learning to drink beer without adding lemonade to it'. Mr Abbott was labelled 'un-Australian' for ordering a light beer during his 2010 campaign. Dr Robert said while drinking was a part of the Australian tradition, it was dangerous to make comments that would only  glorify irresponsible drinking practices and perpetuate the stereotype that drinking heavily makes you a true blue Aussie bloke. Critics said he should be setting an example that you don't have to drink heavily to be a 'true blue Aussie bloke' It appeared to take the Prime Minister about six seconds to down the schooner, as players cheered and chanted 'skol' and 'Tony' Health Minister Sussan Ley was quick to jump to Mr Abbott's defence saying there was 'nothing wrong' with the Prime Minister's antics. \u201cIf more people got up at 4.30 in the morning and went running and cycling and worked as hard as our Prime Minister to keep fit and demonstrate that there are many ways that you can do this, I think we\u2019d have a healthier country as a result,\u2019\u2019 Ms Ley said. During his night out, Mr Abbott gave a speech to the players, according to\u00a0Australian Women's Weekly. 'He grabs the microphone and gives a speech, which went along the lines of: 'well isn't this a real treat, I've been a rugby man all my life but now I finally get to hang out with some real footballers' to which of course the crowd went crazy,' coach Carradous said. 'Then he proceeds to reach down and grab a schooner and he drank from head-to-toe the entire schooner, dribbling little bits on his shirt... He was proud as punch.' While Mr Abbott is not the first Australian Prime Minister to show off his skolling skills, with former Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke a notable example, Dr Roberts said he should have taken into consideration recent shifts in attitudes over heavy drinking. 'I don\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s a partisan thing but I do think the climate has changed and we didn\u2019t [used to] have the concern over binge drinking that we do now,' she said.

What a difference a decade makes. In 2003, when the Massachusetts Supreme Court became the country's first to legalize same-sex marriage, less than 30% of religiously affiliated Americans supported gays' and lesbians' right to wed. By 2014, that number had climbed to 47%, according to a survey conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute. That's more than the 45% who said they opposed same-sex nuptials. The margin is small but statistically significant, said Robert P. Jones, CEO of PRRI, because of the exceptionally large pool of respondents: 40,000 adult Americans. (Eight percent refused to answer or said they didn't know their stance on same-sex marriage.) According to PRRI's poll, there are now more people of faith who favor marriage equality than stand against it, a dramatic turn in one of this country's most divisive debates and a generational shift with the potential to sweep through everything from the wedding industry to the 2016 presidential race. \"There's been a huge swing in the last decade,\" said Jones. \"There are now big, mainstream groups on both sides of the debate.\" If the U.S. Supreme Court has been paying attention, it likely saw this trend coming. Each time the high court has considered a case related to same-sex marriage, the pile of amicus briefs from religious groups supporting gay rights has inched a little taller, and the crowds protesting outside their grand marble steps has gradually grown more diverse. On Tuesday, for example, as the Supreme Court hears oral arguments in Obergefell v. Hodges, a case widely expected to produce a landmark ruling on same-sex marriage, an interfaith coalition of clergy led by the dean of Washington's National Cathedral is planning to march in support of LGBT rights. \"I join with many across the spectrum of American faith communities in my hope that the Court's ruling will permit same-sex marriage in all 50 states,\" the Very Rev. Gary Hall, the cathedral's dean, said in a statement. \"I trust that their judgment will end discrimination against those who seek God's blessing on their marriages.\" Clergy from Hall's religious denomination, the Episcopal Church, have also submitted an amicus brief in support of same-sex marriage. The brief is endorsed by nearly 2,000 faith leaders, including rabbis, Methodist ministers, Lutheran bishops, seminary professors and Congregationalist chaplains. Another brief, submitted by the Anti-Defamation League, is signed by Jewish, Hindu and Presbyterian groups. In a reverse of traditional arguments against gay marriage, some members of these groups say their religious rights will be curtailed if states do not allow them to perform same-sex nuptials. Prominent and powerful religious groups are lined up on the other side as well, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, National Association of Evangelicals, Southern Baptist Convention, Assemblies of God and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also known as the Mormon church. Together, leaders of these faiths represent more than 120 million Americans. But as PRRI's survey shows, there are often differences of opinion between the pulpits and the pews. Despite vocal opposition from the U.S. Catholic Bishops, for example, 60% of Catholics now favor same-sex marriage. That's a huge increase from 2003, when just 35% backed gay rights, according to survey conducted at the time by the Pew Research Center. Mainline Protestants -- so-called for their prominence in 20th century American life -- also saw a huge shift in the last decade. While 36% supported same-sex marriage in 2003, now 62% do. At a glance, the pro-gay marriage faction is now strikingly diverse, encompassing Buddhists, Catholics, Jews and Hindus. But the pro-traditional marriage crowd is just as motley, bridging black Protestants, Mormons, Muslims and white evangelicals, according to PRRI's survey. Same-sex marriage rights worldwide . Legalized nationwide:Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, South Africa, Sweden . Legalized in certain regions:Brazil, Mexico, United States . Civil unions or domestic partnerships:Andorra, Austria, Brazil, Colombia, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Greenland, Hungary, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Slovenia, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Uruguay and parts of Australia, Mexico, United States and Venezuela . The survey data comes from PRRI's American Values Atlas, conducted between April and December of last year. PRRI is a nonpartisan, nonprofit research group that focuses on faith and American culture. Separate surveys conducted by PRRI and other groups show much of the newfound religious support for same-sex marriage is coming from younger Americans. Seven in 10 Millennials, for example, support same-sex marriage and say that faith groups alienate young adults by being judgemental on sexual ethics. Half of millennial Republicans say gays and lesbians should be allowed to marry, and 43% of white evangelical millennials agree. Those numbers could put GOP presidential candidates in a tight spot, said Jones, as they try to expand their base and appeal to younger Americans. \"The real challenge for GOP candidates is how can they plant their feet deftly enough not to offend older conservatives in the primaries but still be able to pivot in the general election to a younger generation,\" Jones said. Politicians may pivot on same-sex marriage, but Bible-believing Christians should not -- even if public opinion turns against them, said Denny Burk, a professor at Boyce College, a Southern Baptist school in Louisville, Kentucky. \"For me, the number of people who come to the message is not the main issue. There are periods when the Gospel is popular and periods when it's not. You can't base your evaluation of its truthfulness on its popularity at a given historical moment.\" Still, Burk said he doesn't doubt that more millennials accept same-sex marriage, and he fully expects the Supreme Court to legalize gay weddings countrywide this June when the justices render a decision in Obergefell v. Hodges. But the fight is far from over, Burk said. \"Just like we've seen this decades-long culture war with abortion, we're going to see the same thing with gay marriage.\"", "reference": "There are now more people of faith who favor marriage equality than stand against it, according to a new poll .\nIf the U.S. Supreme Court has been paying attention, it likely saw this trend coming ."}, "190": {"id": "720934ef22c260fdd9088bc4ca4a04b2f407cbba", "article": "Raheem Sterling may hold all the cards in his contract dispute with Liverpool, but he needs to focus on his football rather than his pay-packet, according to former QPR boss Harry Redknapp. Redknapp insisted that Sterling is not ready to move to the likes of Real Madrid at this stage of his career, so should stay at the club who have helped him develop so far.

She has been unable to work for more than three years and the tribunal said it accepted medical evidence that her City career was effectively over. It heard she was tormented by colleagues on the equity sales desk of the bank, who referred to her as \u2018mad Svetlana\u2019 and said she was \u2018chemically dependent\u2019 and \u2018a major car crash\u2019.

My job was made impossible. This persistent unlawful treatment has had a seriously detrimental effect on my health, with severe and long-term consequences.\u2019 She added: \u2018I am completely broken down and exhausted by the bank\u2019s campaign against me. I can never return to financial services again, which I loved and where I was enjoying considerable success. \u2018Everybody knows everybody\u2019s business in banking and people believe there is no smoke without fire. My reputation has been shredded.\u2019 The tribunal found Miss Lokhova to be a 'resilient person' but ruled that harassment by her colleague at Sberbank (pictured), David Longmuir, triggered 'chronic and long-term symptoms' of mental breakdown . Miss Lokhova (pictured) was falsely accused of being a cocaine addict and branded 'Miss Dodgy Septum' Former manager David Longmuir sent an email to a client in which he said he was \u2018awaiting arrival of Ms Cokehead in a puff of sulphurous smoke\u2019.\u00a0The tribunal said he should have been sacked for gross misconduct but heard he left the bank a year after Miss Lokhova resigned, and received a payout of about \u00a3170,000. When Miss Lokhova brought her legal claim against the bank, the false allegation that she was a drug user was put to her in a public hearing, which she said had made her ordeal worse. The tribunal said it was an attempt to bully her and awarded her aggravated damages to compensate for the \u2018deliberate, planned and unnecessary misuse of these proceedings\u2019. Miss Lokhova took a drug test during the hearing, which was negative. She joined the bank, which is Russia\u2019s largest lender, in 2008 in an \u00a380,000-a-year post. The tribunal heard her salary and bonuses increased until she was earning more than \u00a3750,000 a year. At one point she was awarded a \u00a3600,000 cash bonus after generating profits worth millions. Miss Lokhova said yesterday: \u2018The case has been a long, difficult and draining process which has all but taken over my life and those of people close to me.

James Robarge, 45, from Saxtons River, Vermont was sentenced in court on Friday morning for second-degree murder in the death of his wife Kelly Robarge, 42, who disappeared from her Charlestown home on June 27, 2013. Her badly decomposed body, with her hands and head detached, was found 10 days later in Unity. The judge said he took into account the extent to which Robarge went to conceal his wife's killing and body, as well as the couple's history of domestic violence. James Robarge (above pictured in court last month), 45, of Vermont was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison . Robarge was convicted of second-degree murder in the death of his wife, 42-year-old Kelly Robarge . The couple's daughter, Ciera Robarge (pictured above, center, with her sister Gabriel Robarge Pellerin, right, in court last month) said her mom did not deserve this . Robarge has served nearly two years behind bars which means he could be eligible for parole in about 28 years, according to Valley News. In the statement read by his lawyer on Friday, he told his daughters, 'I love you guys more than life itself' and called their mother 'the love of my life.' One of the couple's daughters, Ciera Robarge, said in court that she loved and missed her mom. 'I love and miss my mom more and more every day,' she said. 'My mom didn't deserve this.' Kelly's brother, Ron Prouty Jr., faced Robarge on Friday and told him, 'I hope you rot in hell.' Kelly's brother, Ron Prouty Jr, told Robarge (above) he hoped he 'rotted in hell' during the sentencing on Friday . During his murder trial, he testified that he had not killed his wife, but a New Hampshire jury convicted him of second-degree murder after deliberating for more than 12 hours over three days. After the verdict was handed down last month, Robarge's two daughters left the courtroom sobbing and clutching one another in disbelief. According to police, Kelly had filed for divorce after 24 years of marriage on June 27, 2013 \u2014 the day she disappeared from her Charlestown, New Hampshire, home and her body was later found. The jury rejected a first-degree murder charge but found him guilty of second-degree murder for reckless conduct that showed 'extreme indifference to the value of human life.' Prosecutors said the entryway to Kelly Robarge's home contained 'countless' spatters of blood. Family members of Kelly react in court on February 11 to the not guilty verdicts on charges of first- and second-degree murder before the announcement of a guilty verdict for the charge of second-degree murder for reckless conduct against Robarge . And James Robarge's disabled car was found several miles from where her body was discovered with a bloodstained trunk and numerous bloody items outside it. However, most of the case was built largely on circumstantial evidence. The closest thing to an eyewitness was a Unity man who said he saw Robarge, wearing latex gloves, crouched beside his disabled car on a turnaround in Unity the night Kelly  disappeared. Her body was found off a logging road not far from there, and forensics experts said metal fragments found near an oil-smeared rock on the road matched Robarge's shattered oil pan. Due to the condition of her body, a medical examiner could not pinpoint the cause of death or determine how her head and hands became detached but concluded she died as the result of 'homicidal violence.' Robarge (pictured in court in January) has served nearly two years behind bars which means he could be eligible for parole in about 28 years . Meanwhile, one of the last people to see Kelly alive the day she disappeared was Frances Uptegrove, a physician assistant who had treated her for anxiety and depression for several years. Uptegrove testified that Kelly Robarge told her she was heading to court to file for divorce. He said: 'She seemed clear-headed, determined. She'd made up her mind.' In testimony spanning two days, Robarge showed no emotion as he repeatedly denied threatening or harming his wife and stared straight ahead when the verdict was announced. Robarge claimed that he didn't know his wife had filed for divorce, but he acknowledged that just days before, he found a letter from her on their kitchen counter saying she wanted one.", "reference": "James Robarge, 45, from Saxtons River, Vermont was sentenced in court on Friday morning .\nHe was convicted of second-degree murder in the death of his wife, 42-year-old Kelly Robarge .\nRobarge has already served two years behind bars which means he could be eligible for parole in about 28 years ."}, "194": {"id": "3f77ac2d823598c19d459fb9fe150b22448efdf7", "article": "(CNN)Have Mercy!

Ron McGee, who penned the \"Unauthorized Saved by the Bell Story,\" will write the \"Full House\" take. The telepic will be produced by the Bell team of Front Street Pictures and Ringaling Productions, with Harvey Kahn and Stephen Bulka also on board to exec produce. For Lifetime, the news comes after its two-hour Bell take fizzled on Labor Day 2014. Despite tons of build-up and excitement from diehard fans of the original comedy series, the Bell take drew only 1.6 million total viewers, with 1.1 million viewers among the 18-49 and 25-54 demographics. That pic was based on former star Dustin Diamond's Behind the Bell 2009 tell-all, with Dylan Everett starring as Mark-Paul Gosselaar and Sam Kindseth as Diamond. Full House aired on ABC from 1987 to 1995. Netflix this month revived the beloved family comedy as \"Fuller House,\" with original stars Candace Cameron-Bure (D.J.), her on-screen sister, Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie), and best friend Andrea Barber (Kimmy), in a 13-episode follow-up series. From its start as an unassuming family comedy in 1987 to its eventual wildly popular 192-episode run, \"Full House\" was \"the little sitcom that could.\" It made huge stars of its cast \u2014 from Bob Saget and Dave Coulier, who were grinding away on the standup circuit, to John Stamos breaking hearts on General Hospital, and the Olsen twins.

Aldi, Waitrose and Lidl managed to increase thiers, with Aldi showing the biggest rise . Tesco has had a troublesome year, with its year-on-year share price down 18 per cent. Last year, they discovered a \u00a3263million gap in their accounts which involved rebates to suppliers and is being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office. Shortly afterwards they sacked boss Phil Clarke who was replaced by Unilever executive Dave Lewis, who announced a series of money-saving measures to try and turn the tide.. The research into the premium ale market doesn't tell a very consistent story, with all but two of the big supermarkets managing to increase their market share. Sainsbury's currently has the second largest share in the beer market which it has improved by 7 per cent while Asda, third, increased by 1.5 per cent. Upmarket Waitrose, which also saw a double-digit increase in the premium ale market, now has a 5.1 per cent share of the entire supermaket industry. But while Aldi made great gains, Lidl, the other rising discounter to have improved its share in the supermarket industry, saw a 7.9 per cent fall in its proportion of the premium beer market. Morrisons\u2019 share dipped 1.4 per cent . In January Tesco published the location of 43 loss-making stores that will close, and shelved plans to open a further 49 stores. City bosses expect them to announce huge losses in profit next week. It's been a totally different story for Aldi, which offers cheap prices and a smaller range that have helped them compete with the big boys. Aldi \u2013 motto Spend a little. Live a lot \u2013 stocks virtually all own-branded goods and and they're market share has grown by 0.7 per cent this year. It plans to open 60 new stores in 2015, more than than Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco put together. Between January and the end of March, Aldi sales grew by 17 per cent from the same time a year earlier. The total market share of the \u2018big four\u2019 fell below 73 per cent, the lowest for a decade. Kantar Worldpanel said Aldi had recorded double-digit growth for the past four years. More than half a million new shoppers visited the store in the three months to March 29, compared to a year before. Lidl also saw sales jump by almost 12 per cent over the period to secure a 3.7 per cent market share.

Now the controversial British professor claims he has new evidence of these 'extra-terrestrial organisms' floating 25 miles (40km) above the planet. He says the organisms test positive for DNA, and have masses that are 'six times bigger than the size limit of a particle which can be elevated from Earth to this height.' Dr Milton Wainwright has been trying to convince academics that he has found aliens in Earth's stratosphere for several years. Pictured are one of the so-called 'ghost particles' that the researcher claims to be proof of extraterrestrial life forms. His views have been widely dismissed by the scientific community . The organisms, he claims, are contained in a microscopic metal globe\u00a0designed by an intelligent species to 'seed' alien life on Earth. Dr Wainwright announced the discovery in an email to his students at Sheffield University, who posted it on Reddit. 'We sent balloons and a sampler and found no pollen or grass, nothing up there to contaminate, it was completely pristine,' Dr Wainwright told Jason Koebler at Motherboard. 'For these reasons, we think [the organisms] are coming from space,' he added. 'All the time when you walk outside, you are being pelted with organisms that come from space.' He said that his latest discoveries has been accepted in the journal Astrobiology and Outreach. Dr Milton Wainwright (right) claims he has new evidence of these 'extra-terrestrial organisms' floating 25 miles (40km) above the planet. He says the organisms test positive for DNA, and have masses that are 'six times bigger than the size limit of a particle which can be elevated from Earth to this height' Dr Wainwright's research has been widely criticised by the scientific community as being backed by poor and flimsy evidence. 'The critics claim that the samples we obtained must have come from Earth, that it that there must be a mechanism which can lift these particles from Earth to the stratosphere,'\u00a0Dr Wainwright told Dailymail.com. Panspermia is a theory that suggests life spreads across the known physical universe, hitchhiking on comets or meteorites. For example, life such as extremophiles, capable of surviving the inhospitable conditions of space, could become trapped in debris that is ejected into space after collisions between asteroids and planets that harbour life. These life-forms may travel dormant for an extended amount of time before colliding randomly with other planets. The idea of directed panspermia, however, suggests that lifeforms are deliberately sent out through the universe by intelligent civilizations . Professor Francis Crick, one of the biologists who discovered the structure of DNA, examined the possibility of this in a paper in 1973. However, Professor Crick and his ccolleagues concluded that the scientific evidence was 'inadequate at the present time to say anything about the probability'. 'However, we have provided evidence that the DNA-containing masses, plus other strange organisms we have isolated are not associated with pollen, grass and fungal spores on our sampler. 'If our organisms came from Earth they must be contaminated with common Earth organisms and they are not.' 'We will probably not be believed until Nasa repeats our findings,' he added. 'I suspect that Nasa they will then try and take the credit by claiming that their methods were somehow more sterile or precise.' Earlier this year, the astrobiologist revealed an image of what he said was a tiny metal ball spewing out a 'gooey' substance in samples gathered by a balloon in the Earth's stratosphere. Dr Wainwright said the ball, which is about the width of a human hair, could be an example of directed panspermia. This describes the belief that life was deliberately sent to Earth by some unknown extraterrestrial civilisation. He argued that the strange material coming from the titanium ball is biological and could in fact be a colony of tiny microorganisms. However, he conceded it is virtually impossible to prove that the tiny sphere was sent by aliens from outer space. Dr Wainwright said the sphere made a tiny 'impact crater' on the sampler that was attached to the balloon as it collected dust and particles in the atmosphere. He added: 'The sphere made an impact crater on the sampling stub. This proves beyond doubt that the particle was travelling at speed from space when it was sampled.' Dr Wainwright and his team discovered the sphere when examining samples of dust and particulate matter collected by a balloon sent around 16 miles into the atmosphere. The metal sphere found by Dr Wainwright and his colleagues (above) appears to be oozing goo from its side . Using X-ray analysis to examine the sphere, he concluded that it was made from titanium and traces of vanadium, while the material appearing to come out of the side was biological. They found that it also had a 'fungus-like knitted mat-like covering'. Dr Wainwright and his colleagues have published their findings in the\u00a0Journal of Cosmology but their conclusions have yet to be corroborated by other scientists. The journal often publishes papers on astrobiology but is highly controversial among scientists as it has been criticised for its peer review process and for publishing papers of a fringe variety. Two years ago it controversially published a paper that claimed to have identified fossils of microbiotic life in a meteorite, sparking a blaze of publicity, but was also met with a great deal of skepticism. The idea that life can survive high the Earth's atmosphere, however, is not new. Scientists working with Nasa recently discovered bacteria living up to five miles above the Earth's surface. However, most scientists believe they are likely to have been carried up from Earth rather than having an extraterrestrial origin. Air currents and winds are known to be capable of carrying dust and bacteria for hundreds of miles and high into the atmosphere. But research has shown that microorganisms can survive the intense heat and pressures of entering the Earth's atmosphere from space, raising the prospect that life may have originally been carried here. Some astrobiologists believe life started on Earth after being carried here on a comet or asteroid, while others believe it is more likely that the basic chemical building blocks were carried in this way rather than established life. However, the idea of directed panspermia has been proposed by some heavyweight scientists. Professor Francis Crick, one of the team who one a Nobel Prize for discovering the structure of DNA, examined whether it was possible that organisms could have been deliberately transmitted to the Earth by intelligent beings from another planet. Dr Wainwright used balloons similar to this one above to collect samples from the stratsophere . He eventually concluded that there was insufficient scientific evidence to support such a claim. Dr Wainwright, however, insists his findings may help to provide some of that evidence. 'Unless of course we can find details of the civilisation that is supposed to have sent it in this respect it is probably an unprovable theory,' he added. Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe, an astrobiologist at the University of Buckinghamshire and editor of the Journal of Cosmology, said: 'I think more work needs to be done on this particular structure, for example to study its DNA, if it has any. 'But already there is clear proof from many directions to confirm that we are constantly bombarded by fragments of comets that carry living microorganisms.' Nigel Watson, author of the UFO Investigations Manual, said the idea that such material were being sent out by aliens attempting to seed other planets was a 'leap of the imagination'. He said:\u00a0'This would seem to provide proof that outer space and not just the surface of our planet is teaming with life. 'I'm sceptical about this and we would need to collect more samples like this to have a better idea of where it originates from. 'It is a leap of the imagination that it came from an ET race trying to seed our planet with their biological constructs. 'Perhaps there are luminous or 'invisible' jelly-fish like creatures that inhabit our skies, or microorganisms flooding our planet, I'm not convinced, but they are fascinating ideas that make a change from stories of starships loaded with aliens.'", "reference": "Radical claim made by Dr Milton Wainwright from Sheffield University .\nHe used balloons to collect dust samples 25 miles (40km) above Earth .\nClaims to have discovered 'alien organisms' that test positive for DNA .\nHis research has been widely criticised by the scientific community ."}, "204": {"id": "07955dc7323a027814bbdacf87a46e554167aac2", "article": "Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker has tipped compatriot Jurgen Klopp to make his mark in the Barclays Premier League if he opts to continue his career in England. Klopp, 47, announced earlier this week that he would end his seven-year stint at Borussia Dortmund when the current season draws to a close, prompting fresh speculation that he could head for the Premier League. Manchester City have already indicated that a man who has also been linked with Manchester United and Arsenal in the past, is not in their sights, but Germany international Mertesacker insists Klopp would be a good fit in the English top flight. Jurgen Klopp has revealed he will be vacating his role as Borussia Dortmund boss at the end of the season . Arsenal vice-captain Per Mertesacker says Klopp would be a top manager in the Premier League . Klopp chats with Dortmund defender Erik Durm during a training session in Dortmund on Wednesday . He said: 'I've got some nice experiences in the Premier League and of course it would be nice if a German coach would take the challenge of working in the Premier League. 'It's not so good for Dortmund that he is leaving but hopefully one day he will manage abroad. I think his passion would fit and to see him in England would be very interesting. 'Everyone has their philosophy and I think Jurgen Klopp has proved that he's top-level and can teach a lot.' However, Mertesacker insisted Klopp, whose side are 10th in the Bundesliga table, will need time to decide on his future after a largely successful spell in Dortmund which has brought two league titles and a Champions League final appearance. He said: 'I think he should just finish the season with Dortmund and then he should be given time. 'We'll see what he does next, but I think he's fought his way out of all situations and I think that this time he will find a path that gives him a new challenge. 'But firstly, I wish him all the best and time to think about his achievements. Sometimes you can underestimate what it's like going straight into a new job. I think you should give him time - and I wish him all the best.' Klopp waves to the fans after Dortmund's Champions League game against Arsenal in November . The German boss has enjoyed a huge amount of success at Dortmund and won the Bundesliga title twice . But for all that a new challenge lies ahead for Klopp, Mertesacker admits he cannot work out what has gone wrong to prompt his exit from Borussia. He said: 'It is obviously sad news for Borussia Dortmund, [he was] such a passionate successful and passionate manager for them. He was the guy who turned it around at Dortmund. 'The whole situation there - he built the squad on young players and they improved so much in the seven years he was in charge. It is a sad situation. 'But in the summer, it will be a new situation for him. Maybe he is going to go abroad and see how it goes there. 'I would love to see more German managers abroad, because it is obviously a new challenge, to adapt to the culture, the language, the system. Yes, why not? 'It is his decision. He worked really hard and pushed really hard, so even if he said he is not tired, maybe he takes a bit of breather to fuel his energy and his batteries? 'But I am curious what happened to him because he was an outstanding figure in the Bundesliga in the last couple of years and always a title contender. They went to the Champions League final.

A Tory parliamentary candidate has sparked outrage after claiming mental health patients should wear coloured wristbands to flag up their conditions. Chamali Fernando, candidate for Cambridge, was speaking at a hustings event last night when she made the startling suggestion. She said wearing wristbands indicating a person's condition would help doctors, lawyers and police officers \u2013 because people suffering mental illnesses often struggled to explain themselves. Ms Fernando, a barrister for 12 years, said: 'Police, social services or hospitals dealing with people with conditions that affect their ability to communicate can decide they are being obstructive or evasive. 'They do not realise the person may have a mental health or other condition. The way they behave often affects the way they are treated. 'Carrying some kind of identification shows they have a particular condition so allowances can be made. 'There are also different ways of doing this without stigmatising the person, such as carrying a card with details of the condition but in some cases by wearing a coloured wristband.' Ms Fernando's 'shocking' suggestion was slammed by the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today. Mr Clegg told MailOnline: 'The Liberal Democrats have spent many years campaigning for an end to the stigma around mental health. 'Silly ideas like making people suffering from mental health issues wear wristbands would only increase the discrimination and stigma around mental health, rather than end it.' Mr Clegg told MailOnline: 'The Liberal Democrats have spent many years campaigning for an end to the stigma around mental health' Miriam Gonzalez Durantez (right), the wife of Liberal Democrats leader Nick Clegg, joined the party's candidate for Hazel Grove, in Stockport, Lisa Smart (left) Julian Huppert, the Lib Dem candidate and Cambridge MP, said: 'I was really shocked at the suggestion that people with mental health problems should be expected to wear wristbands to identify themselves.' Mr Huppert said: 'I have fought hard for many years against the stigma people with mental health problems face. There is already far too much discrimination against mental health throughout our society, and a wristband saying 'I am depressed' is not going to help. 'We need to massively improve mental health support, which has been not good enough for many decades. I hope Chamali regrets her comments and will think carefully about her attitude to mental illness in the future.' Political blogger Richard Taylor reported Ms Fernando's comments at last night's hustings . The Conservative candidate insisted her remarks were 'distorted', adding:\u00a0'It was not that they should wear a wristband. That would be draconian' Ms Fernando has insisted that her comments were 'taken out of context'. She said: 'The question that was asked is how authorities, such as the police, could better deal with mental health issues. 'At Cambridge National Autistic Hustings the chairman of CNAS said he carries a green card in his wallet to identify his condition.

The Bolton fighter had earlier this week come under increasing pressure to take on British rival and IBF welterweight champion Kell Brook in June. However, Khan, who was also linked with bouts against Adrien Broner and Keith Thurman, said he was already deep in negotiations to fight somebody else. Amir Khan (left) has announced his next fight will be against Chris Algieri at welterweight on May 30 . Khan's (right) last fight came against Devon Alexander in December, whom he beat to take his record to 30-3 . Algieri (left) lost his last bout against Manny\u00a0Pacquiao in November - his first defeat in his professional career . Algieri was knocked down six times en route to a heavily lopsided points loss in Macau . And on his wife's YouTube channel Khan announced: 'The next opponent will be Chris Algieri. I will be taking that fight at 147lbs (the welterweight limit).' The fight has yet to be rubber-stamped, but Khan added: 'I'm looking forward to getting this fight announced officially by my manager and advisor Al Haymon. '(His management team) think it's the right fight for me, they want to keep me going.' Algieri's only defeat in his 21-fight professional career came in his last bout against Filipino superstar Manny Pacquiao, who faces Floyd Mayweather in a mega-fight on May 2. Algieri was knocked down six times en route to a heavily lopsided points loss in November last year. Yet Khan believes his American foe is a credible opponent as he wrested the WBO light-welterweight title off the much feared Ruslan Provodnikov in June 2014. Khan said: 'You can class him as an A-class opponent. 'He has fought decent opponents, beaten decent opponents, and just fell short against Manny Pacquiao, which is an A star opponent. 'He's a decent boxer overall. He knows how to box and knows how to move well. He takes a decent amount of shots and he's got a decent amount of power, so I think overall it's going to be a good fight for me.' The 28-year-old hopes to fight in Algieri's home city of New York, with Khan's only previous outing there an 11th-round stoppage of Paulie Malignaggi at Madison Square Garden in May 2010. Adrien Broner (right) had been relentless in calling out of Khan since his comfortable win over John Molina Jr . Khan (pictured in March 2014) hopes to fight\u00a0Algieri's home city of New York next month . Khan (right) has fought once before in New York - where he defeated\u00a0Paulie Malignaggi  in May 2010 . This time, though, Khan wants the non-title bout at the Barclays Center as he said: 'We're looking at fighting in New York, I think New York's a great venue for me. 'Having that fight in New York will be good for the UK fans in a way because it will give them a chance to travel and it won't be as far as going to (Las) Vegas. 'This time I'd like to fight at the Barclays Center, which I've never fought at.' Khan has made no secret of his desire to chase lucrative showdowns against Mayweather or Pacquiao and is confident a win over Algieri can lead him to that. 'Hopefully this can lead me on to the bigger fights in the future, which is what I'm looking at,' he added. But Khan's announcement has left IBF welterweight champion Brook disappointed. Sheffield's Brook retained his world strap with a four-round destruction of Jo Jo Dan a week ago and immediately called out regular verbal sparring partner Khan. The two have spent the week trading barbs - with Brook offering a June 13 date at Wembley for an all-British bout - but Khan made it clear he was going his own way when announcing his next opponent on Thursday. The Bolton man said he will face Chris Algieri in New York on May 30 and Brook cannot understand the move. After Kell Brook's victory over Jo Jo Dan on March 1, he called out Amir Khan in a post-match interview . Khan has previously refused a fight with Brook, but now promises it will take place within 12 months . 'If someone said to me you can get five million quid, a world title, fight at Wembley with a fight that every fan wants to see, it's a no-brainer for me,' 28-year-old Brook told BBC 5 Live. 'He's fighting Algieri who didn't win a round against (Manny) Pacquiao, a feather puncher, not a big puncher. It doesn't make sense to me. 'I'm world champion, I'm calling him out, we want the fight, there's a word title and a bagful of money and it doesn't make sense that he's fighting this guy who's bringing nothing to the table. 'He's said he'll fight me before but when it comes to it, I don't get why he doesn't want to fight me. Yes (I feel frustrated), wherever I go it's always Amir Khan, when are you going to fight him? 'He's delicate around the whiskers, he knows I'm a big strong welterweight and he knows I'm coming for that chin of his.'

The broadcaster had previously reported that the 2012 kidnapping of Mr Engel, which saw him held for five days and expecting to be killed, was carried out by forces associated with President Bashar-al Assad. But Mr Engel has revealed that following analysis of his kidnapping it is likely the men that took him were in fact a Sunni group who had tried to convince their victims that they were Shi-ite rebels affiliated to the Government. Scroll down for video . NBC News chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel (centre) was taken captive with Turkey reporter Aziz Akyavas (left) and photographer John Kooistra (right) and were convinced by their captors they had been taken by forces related to President Bashar al-Assad, but they may have been Sunni rebels instead . A statement posted on the NBC News site said: 'The group that kidnapped us put on an elaborate ruse to convince us they were Shiite Shabiha militiamen.\u00a0The group that kidnapped us was a criminal gang with shifting allegiances.' The statement also raises concerns that rather than being freed following a harrowing firefight, as they were told, this may actually have been staged for propaganda purposes. Instead the captives may just have been handed over. The statement added: 'We have not been able to get a definitive account of what happened that night. But based on all of our reporting, it is clear that we were kidnapped by a criminal gang for money and released for propaganda purposes. 'This, of course, does not make our kidnappers or the five days they held us at gunpoint any less dangerous. It does, however, underscore the treacherous and violent nature of the conflict inside Syria.' Mr Engel and his team were prompted to research the circumstances of the 2012 kidnapping after the New York Times raised questions over the attackers' identities. They suggested the kidnapping was likely to have been carried out by a Sunni criminal element of the North Idlib Falcons Brigade, linked to the Free Syrian Army and known for taking hostages. The New York Times claimed that NBC executives were informed of the suspicions about the kidnappers' identities during and after Mr Engel was taken. Mr Engel was convinced by his captors that he had been taken and held by government affiliated forces . But immediately after his release Mr Engel appeared on Today and in a Vanity Fair interview claiming he had been taken by the shabiha group, government militia loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. He made these assertions based on what he had been told by his captors, which included that they had been rescued by Sunni rebels. The paper claimed that when the captors realised other rebels were trying to free the victims they had actually staged a rescue so they could blame the kidnapping on the Assad regime. Engel and his crew, including producers Ghazi Balkiz and Aziz Akyavas, as well as cameraman John Kooistra, were taken hostage on December 13, 2012, while reporting in Syria. The foreign correspondent said they had met a man who had claimed he was a Syrian rebel commander who had promised to take them across the border to see Iranian and Lebanese prisoners being held by rebels. Syrians run for cover after a mortar shell hit a street killing several in the Bustan Al-Qasr district of Aleppo . They were soon removed from a truck and loaded into a container vehicle by armed men where they were bound, blindfolded and stripped of their passports and shoes. The kidnappers forced the group to make a video and unwittingly set off a distress GPS signal, which informed NBC exactly where they were. \u00a0NBC was able to broadcast images of the farm they were being held at across the world, also informing their kidnappers they knew of the location. Engel and his crew were believed to have been taken near Ma-arrat Misrin, and were pictured in captivity with Arabic sprayed on the wall behind them. It read: \u2018Or will burn.\u2019 A statement published by NBC said it was clear that the group were released for propaganda purposes . During the five days they were held Mr Engel reported apparently hearing one of the rebels they were with being shot, and constantly being subjected to the sounds of guns being loaded - believing each day was his last. He claimed they were constantly tormented by the kidnappers.\u00a0As an example, the 39-year-old correspondent said that one minute, their captors were giving them tea, and the next, they were demanding the crew decide who would be killed first. On the fifth night they were loaded, while blindfolded, into a van. They were told they would be handed over to military forces in  Foua. As they reached a checkpoint there was the sound of gunfire and a dead body was seen on the floor. Engel has since said, in light of the new information, this may have been staged to convince them they were rescued rather than handed over.

The novelist, who died in 2014 aged 90, amassed a spectacular collection of Greek, Egyptian and Roman jewellery during her lifetime, among them pieces up to 3,500 years old. Now the collection is to go under the hammer, with auctioneers saying they expect the exquisite pieces to fetch up to \u00a320,000. Collector: Elizabeth Jane Howard, pictured with Kingsley Amis, collected ancient jewellery . Howard, a former model who became the second wife of Lucky Jim novelist Kingsley Amis in 1965, adored historic jewellery and, despite its great age, was regularly photographed in it. 'Unlike many collectors who prefer to display their treasures, Elizabeth Jane Howard held the view that jewellery was made to be used,' explains Madeleine Perridge, head of antiquities at Bonhams. 'She took great pleasure in wearing beautiful objects that had been worn by women thousands of years ago.' The nine lots, which will go under the hammer at Bonhams auction house in London on Thursday, include rings, bracelets, pendants and earrings. Among the most striking is a gold Roman bracelet made from three gold wires twisted into a spiral design, which has a reserve price of \u00a35,000. Spectacular: This Roman bracelet, which is made from twisted strands of gold, is expected to fetch \u00a35,000 . Beautiful: This pair of earrings are 2,400 years old and are part of a collection thought to be worth \u00a320,000 . Magnificent: This 2,000-year-old pendant depicts the goddess Aphrodite and her son, Eros . A pair of Hellenistic gold hoop earrings, which are thought to be around 2,400 years old, are expected to fetch \u00a32,000. There is also a gold pendant depicting Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love and beauty, with Eros, the Greek god of love hovering above her right shoulder. The piece is set with a cabochon garnet, a nod to Dionysus, the Greek god of wine-making, festivities and fertility, and is likely to have been presented to its original owner as a love token or wedding gift. Oldest of all the items is a pair of Egyptian gold hair rings which have been dated to somewhere between 1550-1295 BC, and are being sold as part of a lot that includes a pair of Roman earrings. Howard, who was born in 1923, started her career as an actress and model but shot to fame in 1950 when her debut novel, The Beautiful Visit, won the\u00a0John Llewellyn Rhys Prize. Subsequent novels included Three Miles Up and Other Strange Stories, Something in Disguise and Getting it Right, although it is the Cazalet Chronicles for which she is best known. The epic six-novel saga charts the fortunes of the eponymous Cazalets, beginning in 1937 as the Second World War looms. Ending in the 1950s, the series has also been described as being a slice of social history and chronicles the changing fortunes of the aristocracy as they face up to a democratic post-war world. But Howard wasn't only known for her books, with the much-married author's tumultuous love life garnering as many headlines as her books. Literary couple: Howard was Kingsley Amis' second wife and the pair married in 1965 . Turbulent: Sadly, their marriage did not last and the couple divorced in 1983 . First married in 1942 to Sir Peter Scott, the conservationist who famously helped found the Worldwide Fund for Nature and provided a scientific name for the Loch Ness Monster, she went on to wed twice more. Of all her marriages, though, it was her turbulent third to Sir Kingsley Amis in 1965 that is best remembered.

The widow of one of four patients whose deaths are being investigated on the Channel Islands last night spoke out to defend the GP at the centre of the police probe. Yvonne Deegan, 77, described the investigation as 'absolutely diabolical' and said she was 'perfectly happy' with the care provided by Dr Rory Lyons. Her husband Bernie Deegan, 70, died suddenly earlier this year following a 12-year cancer battle. Police last week told Mrs Deegan that his death is one of four on the small island of Alderney being investigated as part of a probe into Dr Lyons. The retired stonemason was a close friend of Colin Cosheril, 63, whose sudden death from heart failure last year is being also being looked at. Islanders have said it was concerns over the unexpected death of Mr Cosheril's cousin Karen from pneumonia in January that prompted the investigation in to Dr Lyons, 62, who has been suspended from practicing. But Mrs Deegan, 77, yesterday said she had no complaints over Dr Lyons or the care he gave her sick husband Bernie. She said her husband's death was sudden but not unexpected as he had been ill since he was diagnosed with throat cancer 12 years ago. The great-grandmother said: 'Only God could have helped him. 'I have always been perfectly happy with Dr Lyons and whatever is going on I think it is absolutely diabolical. 'I don't know who started all this but I think they are all very wrong.' Guernsey police sent ten officers to the island last Thursday to raid Dr Lyon's surgery and a private address. The Eagle Medical Practice was searched for five hours and computers and papers \u2013 including medical records \u2013 were seized by police. Mrs Deegan said she did not know why her husband's death was being looked at and police had not given her any information either. The cancer had recently spread to Mr Deegan's chest and specialists in Guernsey had warned the family he did not have long left before he died in January. She said: 'The police are not saying anything. They are telling us not to talk to anyone but they are not telling us anything.' But she said she had no reason to be concerned about how her husband died, adding: 'As far as I'm concerned there should be no reason. They gave him a death sentence 10 years ago. 'I don't really know and I can't really understand it and actually I'm very, very sad about it. 'The police said Dr Lyons was being looked into and Bernie's death had come up and I said well I didn't see why. 'He has been cremated so at least they can't dig him up. Thank God. Because that I wouldn't have.' Relatives:\u00a0Cousins Karen and Colin Cosheril were patients of the Alderney family doctor when they died. Karen, 52, left, died in January of pneumonia and Colin, 63, right, died of heart failure in May last year . The widow said her husband's death was sudden, but said: 'It was in the sense of the word sudden but we knew it was going to happen because the lung specialist in Guernsey told us.' Mr Cosheril's sister Brenda Webb reported his sudden death to the health authorities last year and was told last week it was being investigated as part of the police probe. It is believed the Guernsey health service launched an investigation into Dr Lyons when concerns were raised about the death of divorcee Karen Cosheril, who often used her married name Tayleur, in January. Chief of Police Patrick Rice last night said: 'Our Neighbourhood Policing Team Sergeant has met community leaders and spoken to a wide range of islanders over the last few days. 'Our Alderney-based police officers will continue this work as we seek to ensure islanders are being reassured about this serious investigation.

A controlling Afghanistan veteran who beat his girlfriend and banned her from wearing revealing clothes has been jailed for a two-year-long campaign of terror. Royal Marine Bobby Burnett forced Samantha Chudley to stop wearing make-up because he wanted to make her less\u00a0attractive to other men, and forced her to hand over the passwords of her e-mail and social media accounts so he could monitor them,\u00a0Exeter Crown Court heard. The 30-year-old installed a tracker app on her\u00a0smartphone and brutally attacked her when she visited him at the Commando Training Centre at Lympstone, Devon, and at her home. His violence and the stress of his controlling behaviour led her to have two miscarriages, one of which happened days after he punched her in the stomach when she was ten weeks pregnant, the court was told. The otherwise exemplary Marine's personality changed because he was taking a powerful illegal steroid\u00a0normally given to beef cattle to make them increase body mass, the court was told. He told police she was lying about his repeated assaults but inquiries\u00a0showed he had asked the Marines for help to control his domestic violence. And checks on his mobile phone showed hundreds of texts in which he begged her\u00a0to forgive his attacks and promised to stop hitting her. Burnett was a Marine with an exemplary service record who has been thrown\u00a0out of the Corps after a routine drug screen showed he was taking steroids. Burnett, 30, who has been in custody since leaving the Commando Training\u00a0Centre, admitted aggravated harassment and making threats to kill and was\u00a0jailed for two years and two months by Judge Phillip Wassall. He told him: 'Miss Chudley lost all confidence in herself. She was even\u00a0having to check with you what she could wear and you began to chastise her\u00a0for wearing make up. 'If she ever questioned you, your response was to attack her, grabbing her\u00a0by the neck, holding her up against walls, putting her to the floor and\u00a0telling her to shut up. 'She says the assaults happened on a weekly basis although you say there\u00a0were longer periods between attacks when you could control your temper. 'This was a relationship where you set out to control her by violence to the\u00a0extent her will was completely broken and she became completely subservient\u00a0to your control over the best part of two years. 'You were not only abusing alcohol but taking steroids at the time and it is\u00a0well known they can cause bad temper and cause violence. The 30-year-old installed a tracker app on her smartphone and brutally attacked her when she visited him at the Commando Training Centre at Lympstone, Devon, and at her home, the court was told . 'This was a protracted history of very serious domestic violence. The\u00a0aggravating features are the continued and repeated threats and extreme\u00a0domestic violence. 'You now acknowledge your responsibility and I believe you have had a change\u00a0of heart and are far less dangerous than you were. It is an attribute of\u00a0your steroid abuse that it played some part in your behaviour.' The judge made a restraining order banning Burnett from contacting Miss\u00a0Chudley ever again. Miss Emily Pitts, prosecuting, said texts recovered from Burnett's phone\u00a0showed the domination he asserted over his partner. One said: 'I won't\u00a0change. You will always have to live by my rules and do what I say.' She only left him after two years of repeated assaults and his increasing\u00a0domination in which he would attack her and call her a s**g if she wore make\u00a0up or attractive clothes. Miss Pitts said his attacks and bullying led to Miss Chudley becoming a shell of her normal self and feeling worthless and enslaved. Miss Pitts said: 'She went through months and months of torture. He would go\u00a0out of his way to make her feel like she was nothing. 'She says she felt worthless and he destroyed all her confidence. Friends\u00a0told her they did not recognise her as the same person while she was under\u00a0his control. 'He would constantly question her about where she was and who she was with\u00a0and installed a tracking app on her phone. She felt sick and trapped. 'She is petrified that when he is released she will become the focus of his\u00a0rage at the fact that his life has fallen apart and will find her and hurt\u00a0her or even kill her.' Mr Barry White, defending, said that since acknowledging his guilt Burnett\u00a0is a changed man who is determined to address the issues which led him to\u00a0treat Miss Chudley as he did. He provided references from Burnett's previous partner and a new girlfriend,\u00a0both of whom say he has behaved well towards them. He also provided testimonials from the Marines showing an unblemished 11\u00a0year record in which he saw action in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the 2011\u00a0operation in Libya. He said: 'He went off kilter. This relationship was toxic and dysfunctional\u00a0and he knows he carries the burden of responsibility for that.'", "reference": "Afghanistan veteran Bobby Burnett regularly beat\u00a0partner\u00a0Samantha Chudley and forced her to hand over\u00a0passwords for e-mail and Facebook .\nCourt heard he changed because he was taking a powerful illegal steroid .\nThe soldier had an exemplary\u00a0service\u00a0record but was\u00a0thrown out of the Corps after a routine drug screen showed he was taking the drugs .\nHe was\u00a0jailed for two years and two months at Exeter Crown Court today ."}, "216": {"id": "000642916e3a6c33411c617cf2f3c134a206fba8", "article": "Tim Sherwood will welcome Gary Gardner back into his first team squad during pre-season to assess closely whether the 22-year-old can cut it for Aston Villa in the Premier League.

He thought the \u00a37.99 ornament had been lost forever until he received a letter in the post on March 6 demanding a donation to charity for its safe return. Those responsible for the theft even created a Facebook page to keep fans updated about Ollie's adventures since being snatched. The owl has been pictured sunning itself on a beach after it was 'kidnapped' from a Nottingham pub . The wooden ornament even took a trip on the back of a camel on its travels . Incredibly, the wooden statue has already jetted off to Belfast, Benidorm and even Tunisia despite only going missing a month ago. Pictures posted on the 'Oliver Howel' Facebook page show Ollie sunbathing on a beach towel with an iPod and even taking a ride on the back of a camel. He can also be seen perched on a wall overlooking a beach in Benidorm and is seen sitting on a bar next to pint of Guinness in Belfast. After boarding a plane from the Spanish holiday resort, Ollie teased his owners with a status update saying: 'Hi I'm off again another plane journey.. This one is going to be hot, keep checking in to see where I am.' Today, landlord Richard, who runs the pub with partner Christy Jamieson, 28, said: 'We are missing Ollie but it's been amazing where he's been.

The bird has also popped in to Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem - reputed to be the oldest pub in England. Landlord Richard Stevenson and landlady Christy Jamieson of the Admiral Rodney in Nottingham with ransom letters sent to the pub  following the 'kidnapping' of their owl ornament . It's thirsty work for the owl as it continues to travel around the world; pictured here at a Belfast bar . The owl has managed to take in some sights of Belfast, visiting the historic places in the Northern Irish capital . Landlord Richard bought Ollie from homeware store The Range 18 months ago when the couple took over the pub. The three-inch ornament is part of a set of three that had sat on a shelf in the pub lounge. In the ransom letter posted to the pub shortly after Ollie went missing, the kidnappers said the bird will be back in time for a charity festival on the August Bank Holiday weekend. The jovial note, which arrived in a brown envelope with a Nottingham postal stamp, stated: 'I have been taken against my will...kidnapped. The visit to Belfast also brings the opportunity for the owl to read up some history of the city . The owl took the opportunity of freedom to pose for a photo with Nottingham's most famous resident - Robin Hood . 'I was frightened at first but I really like the people who have taken me from your top shelf. 'I am going to be away for a while, and I am going to travel to lots of different places in England and abroad. 'I've been sitting on your shelf for too long... so I am going to find a girlfriend.' The owl could escape the queues for the Belfast boat tours by flying in, surely... Richard, who lives above the pub, added: 'It's a little bit crazy and just a bit weird how it all came about. 'I absolutely wet myself laughing, especially when I got a friend request on Facebook. 'We've seen a picture of a pink owl, which must be his new girlfriend. I suppose I'm a bit jealous of his travelling, and the regulars think it's hilarious.'

Fourteen soldiers dispatched to restore order after a 2013 coup have been accused of abusing children as young as nine as they begged for something to eat, according\u00a0to a French judicial source. The investigation has been underway since last year but was only made public yesterday. The French president today said: 'If some soldiers have behaved badly, I will show no mercy.' President Francois Hollande has vowed to 'show no mercy' if French peacekeepers in Central African Republic are found guilty of raping hungry children in exchange for food . The French defence ministry has vehemently denied covering up the scandal following revelations it was made aware of the allegations in July last year when it received a leaked UN report on the subject. The ministry said it immediately launched a probe into the case when it received the news, sending investigators to the former French colony on August 1. A defence ministry spokesman urged 'great caution' because the accusations have not yet been proven, adding: 'There is no desire to hide anything. 'We are not hiding the facts, we are trying to verify the facts.' The abuse reportedly took place at a centre for displaced people near Bangui airport between December 2013  and June 2014. Paula Donovan, co-director of advocacy group AIDS-Free World, saw the report. A French soldier taking part in 'Operation Sangaris' stands guard  at the Boali church as people sit on the floor . She said: 'The children were saying that they were hungry and they thought that they could get some food from the soldiers. 'The answer was \"if you do this, then I will give you food\".' Of the six children testifying against the soldiers, four say they were direct victims of sexual abuse while two others witnessed it, the French judicial source revealed. The UN employee accused of the leak, Anders Kompass, turned the report over to French authorities because his bosses had failed to take action and has since been suspended, The Guardian reported. A UN spokesman confirmed  investigators had conducted a probe last year following 'serious allegations' of child abuse and sexual exploitation by French troops. French soldiers prepare to blow up captured weapons and explosive devices in Bangui on December 4, 2014 . French soldiers patrol in a tank in Bangui amid dust as citizens go about their daily business . They added that an unnamed staff member had been suspended for leaking the report. Florent Geel, head of the Africa desk at the International Federation for Human Rights, said Kompass likely leaked the report because those accused are French. He said: 'When it involves Chad, there is never any follow-up. But here it involves France, where there is an independent judicial system, it could move things on.' The violence in the Central African Republic has largely pitted the Christian majority against mainly Muslim Seleka rebels who led the March 2013 coup against former leader Francois Bozize. The country has yet to react officially, but a government member who wished to remain anonymous said that if true, the allegations were 'horrible and unacceptable'.

The Salt card is designed to end the tiresome task of manually unlocking a smartphone or tablet by automatically making it come to life whenever the user is nearby. The credit card-sized gadget also locks devices again as soon as a user moves out of range at a distance of 10 feet (three metres). Scroll down for video . Convenient: The Salt card (pictured) is designed to end the tiresome task of manually unlocking a smartphone or tablet, by automatically unlocking it whenever the user is nearby . Salt connects to an app on a user\u2019s Android handset or iPhone via Bluetooth and also tells them if they have strayed too far from their wallet, where the firm suggests the Salt card is stored. The card was created by Joel Paglione and Niko Zistakis.. They claim it will save people around 53 hours over a year, based on the belief that the average phone user unlocks their phone 150 times a day. The duo, based in Chicago, Illinois, came up with the idea as an increased method of security and a time-saving device and recently raised more than $82,000 (\u00a353,512) on Kickstarter to put it into production. The Salt card is made of durable plastic with a matte finish and is the same height and length as an ordinary credit card. However, it's three times as thick because it has to be big enough to store the battery, which lasts for 18 months. The credit card-sized gadget (illustrated) also locks devices again as soon as a user moves out of range.\u00a0It connects to an app on a user\u2019s Android handset or iPhone via Bluetooth and also tells them if they have strayed too far from their wallet, where it is suggested the Salt card is stored . The start-up claims that its Salt card is more secure than fingerprint scanners, such as the one in Apple's iPhone 6 handset (pictured) and it can be used with gloves in the winter . Chip maker Qualcomm has unveiled its Sense ID 3D fingerprint scanner - the first biometric sensor using ultrasonic technology. It uses ultrasonic sound waves to capture the ridges, sweat pores and more on the tip of a finger in greater detail than capacitive touch ID sensors seen on the likes of Apple and Samsung devices. This not only makes it more accurate than other sensors, but it will also work even if the user\u2019s hands are wet or have dirt or lotions on it, for example. Phones running Sense ID are expected to launch later this year, but Qualcomm did not reveal to MailOnline which devices or manufacturers it is working with. Setting up the card is said to be simple, as users only have to enter the unique 12-digit code printed on the front of the card in the iOS or Android app to register it as their own. From then on, their phone automatically unlocks when they move within 10ft (three metres) of it. It does this thanks to a Bluetooth chip that emits a low-frequency signal that can be read by the phone, but doesn't consume the battery, according to the start-up. \u2018You don't have to connect it your phone like you normally do with Bluetooth - it basically acts as a beacon and finds your phone, unlocking it,\u2019 Mr Paglione said. The card sends notifications to a user\u2019s phone if they leave their wallet containing the card behind, as well as telling them the last location they had it. In the future it will be possible to change the proximity needed for the card to unlock the phone. \u2018So you could set it for 30 feet (9 metres) when you're in your house so you don't have to put in your pin at home, but when you're out you might want it so it only unlocks when the card is in your hand, so you could set it to one foot proximity,\u2019 he explained. It is claimed that the card  will save people around 53 hours over a year, based on the time it takes to type a password into their phone 150 times a day . The card costs $20 (\u00a313) and can be ordered from the company\u2019s website. Mr Paglione, 30, said that as well as being tedious, constantly entering a password can be a security issue because criminals can spot a pattern and there are cameras everywhere. \u2018Many people are looking for additional ways to secure their phone and people are always looking for ways to save time,\u2019 he said. However, it may appear that if a user's handbag is stolen with their wallet including the card and their phone inside, Salt may prove less secure than a stanard password. MailOnline has asked the firm is this is the case. Mr Zistakis, an architect by profession, developed a prototype using a Bluetooth headset and then Mr Paglione added his manufacturing expertise to create the product. He conceded: \u2018There are other people doing similar things, but the difference is we have put it into a device that can be hidden away and at $20 it's very affordable. \u2018The card is waterproof, so you could go swimming with it.\u2019 There are already key fobs that can unlock handsets and many people no longer input a PIN, instead using biometric technology, such as fingerprint scanners and  face scanners, to unlock their smartphones. The iPhone 6, for example, has Touch ID, which enables users to unlock their handset by placing their finger on a button for a couple of seconds, while Fujitsu recently unveiled an iris scanner at Mobile World Congress that uses infrared light to unlock a handset. But the pair of Salt card inventors say that phone unlocking is just the beginning for them and in the future, they hope to develop the idea as a platform for communicating with all sorts of electronic devices. 'One day we'd like the card to communicate with doors, unlocking as you approach them, lights turning on and off or you walk into a restaurant and you won't need to let them know you've arrived, it'll just book you in,\u00a0Mr Paglione said. There are already key fobs that can unlock handsets and many people no longer input a PIN, instead using biometric technology such as fingerprint scanners and iris scanners (illustrated) to unlock their smartphones . Fujitsu has developed a \u2018custom compact and high-output infrared LED\u2019, and a custom infrared camera. These were combined with Fujitsu\u2019s camera controller technology and biometric-authentication technology. It identifies a person by scanning the pattern of their iris. The pattern doesn\u2019t change significantly after the age of two, and it is difficult to injure its surface and difficult to forge. Movements of the smooth muscle of the iris make the eye\u2019s openings larger or smaller, which in turn adjusts the amount of light that enters the retina. For its prototype, Fujitsu has built a miniature scanner so it fits on the front of a smartphone. It recognises the pattern by shining an infrared LED light on the sensor into the eyes and taking a picture of the pattern with the infrared camera. This pattern is registered and linked to the user. Each time they look at their phone, the sensor scans their eye, matches it with the stored image and unlocks the device. \u2018The system can reliably authenticate the detailed patterns of the iris and that can be used in most everyday situations,\u2019 a spokesman for Fujitsu told MaiOnline . \u2018This can be used at a normal smartphone viewing distance, rather than within the 10cm range most existing iris recognition systems require. \u2018And in safety testing, the infrared LED light was verified to be safe for the eyes.\u2019", "reference": "Salt card is designed to replace passwords and fingerprint scanners .\nAutomatically unlocks a phone when the card is within 10ft of the handset .\nGadget also locks a chosen device when it is moved out of range .\nCreators claim the card will save users\u00a053 hours a year in unlocking time ."}, "220": {"id": "6c33eb789f3b72aa5bccf9817026058c8683f3f5", "article": "Burnley boss Sean Dyche has told striker Danny Ings to keep on smiling - and the goals will return.

The hotly-rated Ings, whose future beyond the end of the season has been the subject of considerable speculation, has not found the net in seven appearances. Danny Ings has found goals hard to come by in recent weeks as he looks to try and fire Burnley to safety . Dyche hopes the barren spell is not weighing too heavily on the 23-year-old's mind and has urged him to focus on enjoying his game. Dyche said: 'He's a bright young lad. He's a very good player and a good young lad who is grounded. 'But you can't actually get inside someone. When that whistle blows it's down to them to remind themselves of that freedom I speak about. I want players to play that way. 'His biggest thing is he puts a lot of demand on himself - and that can be a weakness as well as a strength. It's good that he has a thirst to improve, as do a lot of the players. But it has to be balanced with that enjoyment. Sean Dyche is confident that if Ings starts to enjoy playing more, then the goals will flow for the striker . 'I often say to him, play with a smile and I've told him he's best when he does. We're looking to him to continue doing that.' Burnley's battling performances have earned plaudits and despite the lack of goals, they have collected five points from a tough run of eight games. Amid that run they have beaten Manchester City and taken points off Chelsea and Tottenham. They are in the bottom three but just two points from safety and Dyche is backing his forwards to come good again. He said: 'There's certainly not pressure (on the strikers) from me. We ventured down this road early season when the goals didn't come as freely then we had a good patch over the Christmas period. 'We have scored goals and been productive in front of goal. It's about reminding the players what it takes to do that, different ways of doing that and how we can affect games.'

Barnes has found himself in the spotlight of late following his controversial tackle on Chelsea's Nemanja Matic.

Harris, 44, was being restrained by one of the undercover police officers when Bates, who was monitoring from afar, ran up 'trying to get the situation under control' and fired one shot. According to police at the scene in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Bates, a former full-time officer, accidentally pulled out his service weapon instead of the stun gun. Confusion: Robert Charles Bates, 73, accidentally grabbed his pistol and shot a man dead, it has been claimed . Major Shannon Clark told CNN: 'They were struggling trying to get him into custody, he ran up trying to use a less lethal device, trying to get the situation under control, inadvertently he discharged a round from his service weapon.' He added: 'Did an accident happen? Sure. But is it accredited to his age? Or was it accredited to the rapidly evolving situation? I guess that will be determined in the investigation.'

'I allow myself whatever I want but I would have to say my indulgences are that Susie and I drink one bottle of wine each day, white certainly, Chardonnay.\u00a0And chocolate. I'm trying to cut that down but not that successfully.' He made the revelations after a new documentary reunited the father-of-two with the Austin-Healey Sprite he used as a training car before the 1962 Sebring three-hour race. The race took place a month before the crash at Goodwood on Easter Monday that ended his career. He had to be cut out of his Lotus and was unconscious for six weeks. He returned to the cockpit a year later but decided against competing professionally as he felt he was no longer driving instinctively. The Austin-Healey Sprite was also used by the rest of his team, including Hollywood star Steve McQueen and racing legends Innes Ireland and Pedro Rodriguez. Car SOS, which broadcasts on the National Geographic Channel on Thursday, sees the rusty Sprite rescued from a suburban garage and carefully renovated before Sir Stirling puts it through its paces once again. While he found fame hurtling around corners at death-defying speeds, Sir Stirling now takes a more measured approach to the road. For the last 18 months he has been driving a Renault Twizy, an electric car with a top speed of 50mph. He said of the car, which retails for less than \u00a37,000: 'I live right in the middle of London, right by Hyde Park Corner, and the limitations on an electric car like that, you don't notice them. 'If I lived outside the North Circular there might be times when I'd think \"Crickey, I wonder if I'll make it back on the charge\" but having said that, the Twizy is just the sort of car to have around London. Sir Stirling has been married to his third wife, Lady Susan Moss, 62, since 1980 and said the secret to his matrimonial bliss is that he 'married the perfect girl'. Above, the couple at Silverstone in July 2011 . 'It is absolutely very different to the cars I used to drive. There are certainly good reasons to have a petrol car but living where I do, in the centre of London, I can't think of anything better than what I have got.' Sir Stirling, who was knighted in 2000, said he would not want to be a professional driver today because he thinks there are too few races. He said: 'It's quite different now though, they only do 18 races a year, I was doing 52 because I would go down to Australasia in the winter or Malaysia or South Africa and do all types of racing. ' It's so different now that you can't compare the life of a driver then and now. It's unfortunately one of those things that has moved on and I don't think will ever be able to move back.' He has been married to his third wife, Lady Susan Moss, 62, since 1980 and said the secret to his matrimonial bliss is that he 'married the perfect girl'.

City go into the derby at Old Trafford in fourth place, one point behind their neighbours after a 2-1 defeat at Crystal Palace on Monday. Manuel Pellegrini's team are nine points behind Chelsea, who have a match in hand against bottom side Leicester, but Aguero knows better than most that City are not averse to an 11th-hour comeback. Sergio Aguero insists Manchester City can retain the Premier League despite defeat by Crystal Palace . The Argentina international has struggled for form and fitness as City have slipped this season . The Argentinian scored a 94th minute winner to wrest the title from United's grasp in 2012 and he is not giving up on the top prize again just yet. 'Of course we can still win it,' the City striker told Sky Sports News. 'In football, anything can happen - as soon as you think something is certain, then everything changes, we have seen it so many times before and we'll see it again. 'We only focus on ourselves, try to win every game we play and keep pressure on Chelsea.' City have beaten United in the last four Manchester derbies: . 8 April 2013 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 United 1-2 City . 22 Sept 2013 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 City 4-1 United . 25 March 2014 \u00a0 \u00a0United 0-3 City . 2 Nov 2014 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0City 1-0 United . Pellegrini's team were level with Chelsea on New Year's Day, but the Blues have pulled away recently after City lost three of their last five league games. United, in contrast, have won their last five matches, and Aguero is wary of the threat Louis van Gaal's team will pose at Old Trafford. He added: 'They are a team with a lot of great individual players, who can form an incredible unit when they work well together. But this season that has not always been the case. 'Some matches they don't seem to play at the maximum, with the attacking qualities that they have in the team. But then in other games, they have really shown that those qualities, so they are a bit unpredictable. We know we will have to be at our very best to beat them - there's no doubt about that.' The champions face Manchester United on Sunday, having won the last four derbies . Aguero has scored six times against United, including this one at the Etihad in September 2013 . Van Gaal came in for criticism at the start of the campaign after winning just three of his opening 11 matches in all competitions. Radamel Falcao was one of many new signings to struggle under the Dutchman. Seven months after signing the Colombian on a deadline-day loan deal from Monaco, he has scored just four goals for the club. Aguero remains a fan of the former Porto and Atletico Madrid forward, though. Aguero said: 'They have a number of very talented strikers. The one who in his career has been the most predatory is Falcao. 'He isn't having an easy time this season, but I really admire his commitment and his class and qualities are permanent. 'He is probably one of the most naturally-gifted strikers in football at the moment.' Aguero came face-to-face with 'one of the world's most gifted strikers' Radamel Falcao at a Puma event . Falcao has struggled to cement a starting place since arriving at Old Trafford on an expensive loan deal . Aguero has also struggled in front of goal recently, failing to find the net in the last five league games. However, he has scored six times against United and is aiming to add to that tally this weekend. 'I always love to score, but of course it is even more special to score in the big games,' he said. 'If you score against United at Old Trafford it almost give you shivers, because you can feel the tense atmosphere with most of the stadium being really quiet, but the away end going crazy. 'At home at it is different, when the City supporters are really loud in these games, it sometimes gives me goose bumps when they sing my name.'", "reference": "Manchester City can still  mount a title challenge, insists Sergio Aguero .\nPremier League champions face Manchester United in Sunday's derby .\nArgentina ace has praised Old Trafford misfit Radamel Falcao ."}, "228": {"id": "fe368341b10b51753da84cf56e6c1a774fb38315", "article": "A lost iPhone was reunited with its owner after police  posted a series of bizarre photos on the woman's Facebook page in a bid to track her down.

The new menu contains five new food options - two 340-calorie cheesecake-filled donuts, one 380-calorie loaded bagel, one 640-calorie chicken-filled pretzel bun and a 'low fat' 210-calorie steak and cheese wrap. 'This new menu is laden with calories and fat. Many of these calories are considered \"empty calories\" meaning that they have little or no nutritional value,' cardiologist Dr Kevin Campbell told Daily Mail Online. Warnings: Dunkin Donuts' new spring menu features the 640-calorie\u00a0Pretzel Roll Chicken Sandwich which contains 68 per cent of your daily allowance of salt . Sweet tooth? The new menu also features two new flavors of the chain's Cheesecake Square Donuts, which each contain upwards of 340 calories . Obesity and obesity-related illness has become epidemic; in the US alone obesity and obesity-related illness accounts for a $150 billion dollars of healthcare expenditures annually . 'As adults we must set good examples for our children because they pattern our behavior we must avoid eating food such as these presented on the new menu at Dunkin' Donuts.' Indeed, the food chain's new Pretzel Roll Chicken Sandwich - which is described on the Dunkin Donuts website as containing 'delicious breaded chicken, cheddar cheese, bacon and honey mustard' which are all \u00a0'served on an oven-toasted pretzel bun' - contains a whopping 640 calories, almost a third of your recommended daily intake. Additionally, the sandwich contains 1,560mg of sale, which is equal to 68 per cent of the daily recommended intake of 2,300mg. The roll also contains 25g of fat - 38 per cent of your daily intake. And when paired with one of Dunkin Donuts' new ice cream-inspired coffee flavors - Rocky Road Swirl, Butter Pecan Swirl, or Cookie Dough Swirl - customers are adding a minimum of 200 odd calories to their meal, if they opt for whole milk and sugar in their coffee. Another option listed on the new menu is the Southwest Supreme Bagel, which is stuffed with cheese, corn, black beans, peppers, tomatoes, onions and spices and contains 380 calories and 890mg of salt - which is 37 per cent of the recommended intake. Something savory: The\u00a0Southwest Supreme Bagel contains 380 calories and 890mg of salt . Healthy? The 210-calorie Snack N\u2019 Go Steak Wrap is intended to be a low-calorie alternative to the other menu options, however it still contains 25 per cent of your daily saturated fat intake . Healthier than the pretzel roll, yes, but still not the most nutritious treat around. Indeed, the only 'healthy' option offered on the new menu is a small Snack N\u2019 Go Steak Wrap, a 210-calorie snack that contains 'our delicious angus steak, a slice of cheddar cheese and honey mustard sauce, wrapped in a warm tortilla'. But while this tasty treat is being marketed as a healthier, low-calorie option, it still contains five grams of saturated fats, which is the equivalent of 25 per cent of your recommended daily intake. Last, but not least, the menu also contains two new varieties of Dunkin Donuts' signature Cheesecake Square Donut, which is essentially a sugary pastry stuffed with cheesecake filling, this time in Oreo and raspberry flavors. And while the nutritional information for these individual sweet treats has not yet been made available on the Dunkin website, the standard Cheesecake Square Donut contains 340 calories and eight grams of saturated fats - 40 per cent of your daily allowance. Unsurprisingly, the chain's unhealthy menu options have prompted some health-conscious Twitter users to voice their concerns over the calorie-laden choices. 'If Dunkin Donuts replaced their white flour with organic whole wheat and sugar with stevia, they would probably still be unhealthy,' one man wrote, while one woman added: 'These Dunkin Donuts options have to be the most unhealthy things ever.'", "reference": "The popular food chain's new spring menu includes a 650-calorie chicken-filled pretzel roll and a 400 calorie bagel .\nEach of the chicken pretzel rolls contains 68% of your recommended daily allowance of salt .\nThe new menu contains one 'healthy' option, a 210-calorie steak wrap - which still contains 25% of your daily saturated fats .\nCardiologist Dr Kevin Campbell explained to FEMAIL that the menu items are full of 'empty calories' that have 'little or no nutritional value'"}, "230": {"id": "ad633d725e1de293828728f4b8720ed332007458", "article": "England may be well on course to sealing their spot at Euro 2016 but it appears as if manager Roy Hodgson still does not know his best XI. Sportsmail's\u00a0top team of reporters have submitted their starting line-ups for the finals in France, assuming everyone is fit of course. Let us know your England XIs by posting them in the comments section below. England manager Roy Hodgson pictured at the Juventus Stadium during Tuesday's friendly against Italy . MATT LAWTON . Hart; Clyne, Cahill, Jagielka, Baines; Henderson, Wilshere; Welbeck, Rooney, Sterling; Kane . Not perfect by any means but I think it\u2019s important to keep Rooney in a more central position, in the No 10 role he is most comfortable in, behind the best striker at this moment in time. Right now it\u2019s Kane but Sturridge and Welbeck certainly offer good alternatives. There\u2019s pace in that team as well. No natural holding player? I\u2019m not convinced Carrick is the way forward. Get the best players on the pitch. England captain Wayne Rooney (centre) looks to get a shot in at the Italian goal on Tuesday . IAN LADYMAN . Hart; Clyne, Cahill, Jagielka, Baines; Henderson, Wilshere; Welbeck, Rooney, Sterling; Sturridge . England\u2019s defensive options remain their big problem so this is a team set up to score goals and win games by playing on the front foot. Luke Shaw hasn\u2019t done enough yet to displace Baines while Henderson and Wilshere represent a holding duo at the base of the midfield that should provide security bit also the ability to get the team moving forwards when appropriate. Rooney is picked in this team in a central role while Sturridge gets the nod ahead of young pretenders such as Harry Kane simply on the back of experience. This is the first game of a major tournament after all. Daniel Sturridge (left) charges forward with the ball during last September's friendly against Norway . ROB DRAPER . Hart; Clyne, Cahill, Jones, Gibbs; Carrick; Henderson, Wilshere; Sterling, Rooney, Welbeck . No place for Daniel Sturridge at present and you might have to re-think if he's clear of injuries - but for the moment Rooney has to play up front. If England need a more attacking shape, Rooney can drop in and Sturridge come on for Wilshere or Henderson, but I'd be wary of starting that way, as England couldn't defend properly with two midfielders in Brazil. The back four doesn't convince but Jagielka and Baines struggled at the World Cup and Johnson is now out of the reckoning. England's Jordan Henderson in action against Italy at the Juventus Stadium on Tuesday night . MATT BARLOW . Hart; Clyne, Cahill, Jones, Baines; Henderson, Carrick, Milner; Sterling; Rooney, Welbeck . Not far off the team Hodgson picked against Lithuania on Friday. It's as good as we get at the moment. Wish it was stronger at the back, where perhaps Smalling and Bertrand can apply pressure. No place for Wilshere in a three-man midfield. Need mileage and ball-winning abilities to offset the luxury of Carrick in as a playmaker. Rooney and Welbeck on the basis they have delivered in international football but much will depend on Kane's second season and the fitness of Sturridge. Gary Cahill (left) tackles Lithuania's Saulius Mikoliunas during last Friday's Euro 2016 qualifier . SAMI MOKBEL . Hart; Clyne; Cahill, Jones, Gibbs; Henderson, Oxlade-Chamberlain; Welbeck, Rooney, Sterling; Kane . The two biggest calls here are Gibbs over Baines and Chamberlain instead of Wilshere. For me, the two selected will add more athleticism to the side without the loss of quality. There's certainly goals in this team, as well as pace. Europe beware! England left-back Kieran Gibbs (right) looks to run past Italian Alessandro Florenzi . JOE BERNSTEIN . Hart; Walker, Jones, Stones, Shaw; Carrick, Henderson; Sterling, Rooney, Young; Sturridge . It's ridiculous that Michael Carrick is only now getting the international recognition he deserves. He should have been a regular in the last two World Cups and will only be 34 at Euro 2016. With him and Rooney in the middle and lots of legs and energy around them, England should be able to play the quick and accurate tempo displayed by Liverpool in the last couple of years. Personally, I think that's the way to go rather than try and hit a big centre-forward like Harry Kane. Youngsters like John Stones and Luke Shaw will really emerge over the next 12 months. Michael Carrick (right) controls the ball as Roberto Soriano looks to make a challenge in Turin . RIATH AL-SAMARRAI . Hart; Clyne, Smalling, Cahill, Baines; Carrick, Wilshere; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Rooney, Sterling; Kane . The big unknown is Harry Kane's progress and whether he will do it all again next season. It's perhaps harsh on Daniel Sturridge, who has proven his effectiveness over greater time, but how can anyone currently bet against Kane? The big weakness remains at centre-half - neither man truly looks the part at the international level but Smalling has improved this season. At 25 he needs to improve further still. If Sterling's ego can process being on the left, where he has shown himself to be more than capable, then this could be a delightful attack. England's Harry Kane (right) leaves Italy's Giorgio Chiellini face down on the pitch during the friendly . MIKE KEEGAN . Hart; Clyne, Cahill, Jagielka, Baines; Henderson, Carrick, Barkley; Sterling, Rooney, Welbeck . Welbeck just gets the nod over Kane primarily for his pace and movement which is vital to England attacking at pace. If there is any chance John Terry can be lured back he walks in at the expense of Jagielka. Carrick must start and Barkley must cut down on giving the ball away in dangerous positions but offers more going forward than Fabian Delph. Baines gets one last chance to deliver on the international stage, ahead of Kieran Gibbs.

To be fair, however, this probably wasn\u2019t the first thought to strike rush-hour drivers as they watched him crash through a fence and come hurtling towards them. Like a scene from Wallace and Gromit, the intrepid sheepdog was at the controls when he sent the farm utility vehicle down a steep bank, on to the busy carriageway and into the central reservation barrier. Don's owner Tom Hamilton (pictured) was tending to a lamb when the sheepdog took control by nudging the controls . The tractor smashed through a fence before ending up on the road. Don was unhurt in the ordeal but the incident caused major tailbacks . Despite considerable damage, Don escaped unhurt \u2013 but left scores of motorists wondering if they were imagining things.

Sheep farmer Tom Hamilton was travelling across a field in the John Deere Gator farm vehicle with his companion in the passenger seat during their morning rounds. Behind the wheel: Don leaned on the controls of the tractor before driving it on to the M74 near Abington in South Lanarkshire during rush hour . The vehicle shot out of the field and crashed down a bank by the side of the road before colliding with the central reservation of the M74 near junction 13 northbound as shown by the red arrow . Moments after he got out of the vehicle, it took off with Don at the wheel. Safely back at nearby Kirkton Farm yesterday with Don at his side, Mr Hamilton explained: \u2018I was sorting out one of the lambs and hadn\u2019t put the brake on. \u2018When I turned around I saw it racing towards the motorway. I ran after it but I couldn\u2019t catch up.\u2019 Traffic Scotland tweeted the news that a dog had 'taken control of a tractor' before adding, 'nope, not joking' Officers cleared the motorway within half an hour and Don was reunited with his relieved owner at nearby Kirkton Farm .

One of his most shameful moments was broadcast on national television when he labelled his pregnant wife a 'c***'. During an episode of SBS's Heat in the Kitchen, Kemp was so enraged he unleashed an expletive-ridden tirade on his then-wife\u00a0Lela Radojkovic, who was carrying their first child, while filming at Sydney's Restaurant Balzac in 2004. Scroll down for video . The extent of Matt Kemp's rage is seen during an episode of SBS's Heat in the Kitchen, which was broadcasted in 2004 . Kemp is pictured here with his fiancee, Christie Webber, who is marrying at the end of the year . The award-winning chef told Radojkovic: 'If you weren't my f***ing wife I would f***ing sack you - you c***.' Looking back, Kemp says he regrets treating his ex-wife that way. 'It really makes you feel proud of the human I was, not. You say things in the heat of the moment that you don't even think about until someone catches it on TV,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Kemp discusses his anger issues on Tuesday's episode of Insight on SBS. The chef is pictured here with three of his children. He said he missed out on a lot of their childhoods . Kemp (second from left) is pictured here with My Kitchen Rules judge Colin Fassnidge . The 44-year-old said he would work himself into a 'frenzy' because of his uncontrollable rage. 'I would be doing so many things that my head would explode - you can't clone yourself,' Kemp told Daily Mail Australia. 'I would get so angry and worked up that I couldn't speak.' It also isolated him from his kitchen staff who he said at the time he did not care about, but now he takes the time to praise them. One of his biggest regrets before he 'grew up' and became less 'hot headed' was not being there for the births of his children. 'Before I wouldn't take time off for work and if I did I would never stop thinking about it,' Kemp told Daily Mail Australia. Former NRL player Mark Geyer also had anger management issues and appears on Insight on Tuesday alongside Kemp . Geyer, who used to play for the Penrith Panthers, is pictured here with his wife, Meagan, who he describes as his rock . 'I didn't see my first two children get born. I didn't see my third child really get born. 'I've got four kids, I've got to be a dad, that sort of thing makes you grow up a bit. 'I want to be a dad. I want to spend time with them.' Kemp attributes getting older as a reason why he decided to change his attitude and behaviour about five years ago. The chef now works at Charing Cross Hotel in Waverley - in Sydney's east - and still raises his voice in the kitchen, but it does not escalate to 'uncontrollable rage'. After turning his life around, Kemp met his fiancee, Christie Webber, who he will marry at the end of the year. Another panellist on Tuesday's Insight is former NRL player Mark Geyer, 47, who got in trouble a number of times for violence after consuming alcohol. 'I got charged with assault when I was 22. I have a record for the rest of my life,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I didn't walk away. I never started the fight in the pubs and clubs, but I finished them. 'There was a ticking bomb inside of me.' The proud father-of-five said having children was the push he needed to turn his life around . The family man has urged people to 'walk away' from a fight and not engage in fights . The proud father-of-five credits his turnaround to his children, without any help from a counsellor. He said the anger he felt before was now being re-directed to get angry at things that could hurt his children. 'The whole reason I stopped being a mug and stopped my anger was because I had children,' Geyer told Daily Mail Australia. 'I suddenly had someone to worry about instead of myself.' Geyer, who works on-air for Sydney's Triple M, told Daily Mail Australia he was 'a volcano waiting to erupt' between the ages of 17 and 26. He said the two reasons why he acted so aggressively was because he was bigger than most people and he used his size to intimidate people. Kemp and Geyer will appear on Insight's Anger episode on SBS One on Tuesday from 8.30pm . The former Penrith player said his turning point happened when his wife, Meagan, was pregnant with their first child. He said she told him to clean his act up and become the man she had married. 'I saw the ultrasound of my first baby and it made sense,' Geyer said. 'I come from a great family there was no excuse...\u00a0I was becoming the opposite of what my parents wanted me to be.' Geyer urged people who had similar issues that he did to watch Insight and start to change their lives. 'I try to tell my kids, walk away,' he said. 'If you see someone in dramas always try to help, but if they're looking for trouble it's a mug's game.'

'He should have been in a retirement home, not out there on the scene killing my dad,' Aidan Fraley said of Robert Bates. The 16-year-old told NBC he believes everyone on the Tulsa force is to blame for his father the April 2 death of his father Eric Harris and says 'they should all go down.' 'He should have been in a retirement home, not out there on the scene killing my dad': Aidan Fraley (right), 16-year-old son of slain unarmed Tulsa suspect Eric Harris (left) has spoken out to say that his father's 73-year-old killer should never have been deputized and given a gun . 'They should all go down': Fraley (here with his uncle Andre Harris), says all the Tulsa police who allowed Bates to become a cop should be held accountable for his death . Meanwhile, his own mother--who calls Harris her 'soulmate'--has already forgiven his killer. 'The Lord has forgiven me for my sins, and who am I not to forgive him?' Fraley told NBC as she spoke out on the case for the first time. Her young son, however, is not ready to forgive and wants to see the other police officers at the scene brought to justice. 'They were involved in it,' he said. 'One of the dudes had his knee on his head, and I feel like that played a part in his death after the shooting.' Bates has said he mistakenly pulled out a handgun rather than a stun gun when he fatally shot Eric Harris on April 2 as he lay on the ground. He has been charged with second-degree manslaughter. Defense attorneys released some of the training records Saturday for a 73-year-old volunteer sheriff's deputy charged with manslaughter in the fatal shooting of an unarmed suspect in Oklahoma. The records for Robert Bates include certificates showing what training he received, job evaluation reports and weapons training and qualification records dating to 2008.

I'm losing my breath' Bates' attorneys said the 64 pages of records released to The Associated Press and other news organizations include records Bates copied and kept for himself. Although there are time gaps in the documents provided, some of the records seem to indicate Bates was proficient in firearms and dozens of other training courses. 'For the first time today, we feel like someone's starting to look at the other side of this as far as his qualifications,' Scott Wood, an attorney for Bates, said after the documents were released. The Tulsa County volunteer deputy has disputed a Tulsa World report that sheriff's office supervisors were ordered to falsify his training records. The World said at least three of Bates' supervisors were transferred for refusing to go along with the requests, and said it consulted multiple sources who spoke on condition of anonymity, but it gave no indication how those sources were familiar with the situation. Bates told NBC's 'Today' show on Friday that he was certified for his position and had the documentation to prove it. Harris' family attorney - who had questioned Bates' qualifications as a reserve deputy - did not return a message seeking comment Saturday. A call to the district attorney's office rang unanswered, and the sheriff's office referred questions to Wood. 'I want to do everything I can to make sure that people know that this allegation of falsified records is not true,' Wood said.

Since its construction in 1895, its high walls housed some of the country's most dangerous criminals whose uprisings ended in death and mass-injury. And haunting images published in 2011 proved that government doctors used the jail in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to test chemical substances on inmates and disabled American citizens. Nearly two decades after its closure in 1995, all that remains of one of the most notorious and violent prisons in American history is cracked paint, crumbling hallways and empty cells which once housed its human guinea pigs. Decay: The 1,200 inmates once housed inside Holmesburg Prison - where some rooms were padded with filthy mattresses (pictured) - were subjected to cruel clinical experimentation . Filthy:\u00a0Since its construction in 1895, some of the country's most dangerous criminals walked the halls of Holmesburg prison (pictured) Cruel: Images which emerged in 2011 (pictured) showed the aftermath of  experiments carried out on the prisons inmates and proved the brutal tests were taking place . Ghostly: These now-empty cells inside the abandoned Philadelphia jail were once occupied by desperate inmates who underwent the cruel procedures for 'money to buy cigarettes' Command: The guards ran the cruel institution from the 'control room' where they would monitor and coordinate their response to  riots . Silence: Since its closure in 1996, one of the few things that remain in tact in Holmesburg Prison are the old books read by prisoners who were once used as human guinea pigs . 'Accidental death': Many people were killed inside Holmesburg and in one incident in 1952, an inmate found dead in a bathtub with an autopsy concluding that he was beaten to death . Abandoned: Nearly two decades after its closure in 1996, the prison's halls have fallen eerily silent as the terrifying building slowly wastes away . Urban photographer Cindy Vasko captured the eerie silence and gradual decay of the once-overcrowded prison, which has become infamous for the medical testing that took place on its inmates. Prisoners in the jail were paid to test a variety of dangerous substances such as radioactive, hallucinogenic and toxic materials according to an author who saw the intense cruelty with his own eyes. They were deliberately 'exposed to pathogens that caused skin infections' such as herpes and the fungus which causes athlete's foot, Allen Hornblum claimed in his book\u00a0Acres of Skin. He claims that between 1951 and 1974, these inmates acted as lab rats for over 30 pharmaceutical companies and government agencies. Historic images now show the 'patients' covered in bandages which for their many wounds and scars. One former prisoner who featured in a book about the cruelty which took place there says he agreed to have a layer of skin peeled of his back - only to be coated with searing chemicals. During the experiment which he took part in for money to buy cigarettes in prison, he remembers screaming: 'Oh my God, my back is on fire! Take this... off me!' The man coordinating these atrocious exams was renowned dermatologist Dr Albert Kligman who wrote hundreds of scientific papers on what are now considered everyday maladies such as dandruff and acne. But Kligman's distinguished career was tarnished by accusations of human cruelty inside Holmesburg prison that inspired federal restrictions on human testing, according to the New York Times. Torture: Dissidence was dealt with severely and the men who led a hunger strike in 1938 were locked in 'the bake ovens' (not pictured) where four of them 'roasted to death' Revolt: When a warden and his deputy were mercilessly stabbed to death in July 1970, it sparked a massive uprising that left 103 people include 29 other guards severely injured . Experiments: A review of medical journals from the prison revealed that some tests were carried out with the hopes of finding lifesaving treatments . Painful: While others seemed only to quench the curiosity of the men leading the experiments - causing great pain to the patients without yielding any results . Infected: The cruelty unfolding at Holmesburg was not isolated and at Stateville prison (pictured), an army doctor watched malaria-carrying mosquitoes bite the stomach of another inmate . Tragedy: The inmates - who would eat in this now-filthy cafeteria - were deliberately exposed to pathogens that caused skin infections such as herpes and the fungus which causes athlete's foot . Dangerous:\u00a0The prison was the site of hundreds of violent attacks, breakouts, corrupt guards and rape of prisoners who stayed in bare cells like this one . Regarding his factory line of human\u00a0guinea pigs, Mr Hornblum said: 'He had a dozen or two experiments going at one time... He turned Holmesburg into the K-Mart of human experimentation. It was a real industry.' Holmesburg has left such a terrifying legacy that it has since been used as the set of violent prison movies such as Animal Factory in 2000 and Law Abiding Citizen starring Gerard Butler in 2009. Almost 300 former prisoners filed a lawsuit against the City of Philadelphia and Albert Kligman in 2000, alleging they were cruelly experimented on between 1961 and 1974. Partly due to the abuses at Holmesburg, federal regulations were tightened up to restrict medical studies inside prisons to those posing minimal risks to inmates. Kligman became a wealthy man and a famous name in dermatology after being credited as the inventor of Retin-A, an acne cream and wrinkle-remover. Kligman denied any wrongdoing, according to the Baltimore Sun\u00a0who quote him as saying: 'My use of paid prisoners as research subjects in the 1950s and 1960s was in keeping with this nation's standard protocol for conducting scientific investigations at that time. Brutal:\u00a0One former prisoner who featured in a book (not pictured) about the cruelty which took place there says he agreed to have a layer of skin peeled of his back - only to be coated with searing chemicals . Systematic:\u00a0Between 1951 and 1974,  inmates housed in these now-empty cells acted as lab rats for over 30 pharmaceutical companies and government agencies . Ringleader: The man coordinating these atrocious exams was renowned dermatologist Dr Albert Kligman who would carry out tests on tables like this . Accused: Dr Kligman denied any wrongdoing and claims his use of 'paid prisoners as research subjects' was in keeping with the nation's scientific protocol . 'To the best of my knowledge, the result of those experiments advanced our knowledge of the pathogenesis skin disease, and no long-term harm was done to any person who voluntarily participated in the research program.' The prison was also the site of hundreds of violent attacks, breakouts, corrupt guards and rape of prisoners, according to Philly.com. It alleges that 25 leaders of a hunger strike in 1938 were locked up in a section of the prisons known as 'the bake ovens'. The prison guards turned the heat in the rooms up to 190 degrees Fahrenheit and when the doors were opened 58 hours later, four inmates had 'roasted to death'. In another horrific incident in 1952, an inmate named Thomas Donato was found dead in a bathtub. Officials claimed he had drowned himself but results of the autopsy concluded he was beaten to death. And when a warden and his deputy were mercilessly stabbed to death in July 1970, it sparked a massive uprising that left 103 people include 29 other guards severely injured.\u00a0The prison shifted 235 of its most dangerous inmates to the equally infamous Eastern State Penitentiary following that incident.", "reference": "Haunting images show the decaying ruins of Holmesburg Prison where scientists experimented on its prisoners .\nInmates were paid to test a variety of dangerous substances such as radioactive, hallucinogenic and toxic materials .\nRenowned dermatologist who experimented on prisoners has claimed no harm was done to any of the 'volunteers'\nThe prisoners who led a 38-day hunger strike in 1938 were locked in 'the bake ovens' where four 'roasted to death'"}, "237": {"id": "2b5916588ecce9857ad0a43a59596ad79cd8e9c5", "article": "Leeds showed they are in good shape to cope with Kevin Sinfield's retirement as they claimed a 26-12 derby victory over Castleford in front of a sell-out crowd at the Mend-A-Hose Jungle. The First Utility Super League leaders were without their inspirational captain, who this week announced he is to switch codes at the end of 2015, for the third successive game on Good Friday, but they continue to thrive without him. The Rhinos had beaten Wigan and Catalans Dragons in Sinfield's absence and added Castleford to that list thanks to an excellent team performance, with young winger Ash Handley particularly impressive up against the formidable Justin Carney. Leeds Rhino's Adam Cuthbertson celebrates a try with Jamie Peacock (left) Ryan Hall was sent to the sin-bin for the first time in his career in a frenetic opening but Castleford failed to take advantage and it was the Rhinos who struck first as Joel Moon scored his first try of the season. Hall made amends by extending Leeds' lead and Stevie Ward's converted try cancelled out Michael Shenton's effort to give the Rhinos a 16-6 half-time lead. There were chances aplenty at the start of the second period but brilliant defence by both sides meant there was no further addition to the score until the 63rd minute, when Hall completed his double. Adam Cuthbertson then crossed for a try his performance deserved and despite Shenton's late second, Leeds extended their unbeaten run against the Tigers to six matches. Leeds Rhino's Joel Moon scores the first try for his side during their victory . Brian McDermott warned the Rhinos to be wary of a fast start by Castleford and although it was Leeds who came out of the blocks quickest, the Tigers were handed an early advantage when Hall was sent to the sin-bin for a professional foul. Leeds youth product Luke Gale failed to exploit the gap in the Rhinos' left side when his pass to James Clare from the resultant penalty floated forwards. Liam Sutcliffe was next to fluff his lines as he spilled the ball reaching for the tryline, but Leeds did not have to wait much longer for their first try of the afternoon. The Rhinos rolled downfield after a knock-on by Scott Moore, and Danny McGuire exchanged passes with Brad Singleton before putting Moon through a hole to score. Hall had returned to the field just in time to congratulate his team-mate and he was celebrating a try of his own soon after. Leeds Rhino's Ryan Hall goes over the line for their third try of the clash . McGuire was hauled down just short of the line after Moon's break but Cuthbertson kept his cool on the next play to give Hall an easy finish in the corner. Sutcliffe landed the touchline conversion to give Leeds a 10-0 lead. The Rhinos went in search of a crucial third try - with Brett Delaney just held up over the line - but their lead was cut to four points when Shenton reacted quickest to Liam Finn's dab through and Gale kicked a goal from out wide. The momentum was suddenly with Castleford as they probed for another try to level up the contest, but such was its nature that Leeds re-established their 10-point lead. Rhinos captain Kevin Sinfield sat out during the week he announced he was switching codes . Kallum Watkins played a big part in taking the Rhinos close to the Tigers' line and Sutcliffe's neat reverse kick sat up nicely for Ward to get downward pressure on the ball. Good defence by Sutcliffe denied Shenton his second try at the start of the second half before Cuthbertson was held up over the line at the other end. The excitement continued as Carney picked up a loose Leeds pass well inside his own half and raced clear seemingly destined to score, only for McGuire to slow him down with an ankle tap before Handley hauled him down. Leeds Rhino's Zak Hardaker makes a run during the Super League match at the Mend-A-Hose Jungle . Carney then turned try-saver when he stopped Zak Hardaker finishing off a Rhinos break and Leeds were denied by more impressive Castleford defence as Singleton was held up. The visitors finally broke through for a fourth time when McGuire spotted his side had numbers on the left and found Moon, who gave Hall another simple task in the corner.

Apparently, hormones are a major factor one should consider. According to one female businesswoman in Texas, Hillary Clinton shouldn't be president because her hormones might make her so irrational she'll start an unnecessary war. When George W. Bush waged an unnecessary war in Iraq -- was his testosterone to blame? As Cheryl Rios, the CEO of Go Ape Marketing, sees it: \"We're built differently, we have different hormones. In the world that we live in, I understand that there's equal rights and that's a wonderful thing and I support all of that. I don't support a woman being president.\" \"With the hormones we have there is no way we should be able to start a war,\" Rios wrote in a Facebook post. If Rios is concerned about hormones impacting decisions in the Oval Office, she'd be better off worrying about the male candidates for president. Throughout history, male hormones have indeed impaired some male leaders' decision-making. Studies show that women leaders take fewer unnecessary risks than their male counterparts. If science doesn't convince you, just Google \"cheating politicians\" for the long and sordid list of men like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mark Sanford and John Edwards, whose hormones got the best of them. Rios has taken a lot of flak for her \"biblically\" inspired beliefs, but she's not the only one who's arguing that a woman's hormones are a legitimate leadership concern. Time magazine declared Hillary Clinton the \"perfect\" age to be president, because she's a postmenopausal woman who is \"biologically primed\" to lead. (She also happens to be a former first lady, senator and secretary of state.) I'm not joking. Believe me, I wish I were. No wonder Jon Stewart left \"The Daily Show\" before the election cycle ramps up in full swing. If discussions about a candidate's hormones are what we have to look forward to, the state of presidential politics is depressing indeed. But underneath the biochemistry debate is a much scarier consideration: The bias against women in the workplace is so well established that even in 2015, a female candidate will be hard-pressed to get elected unless we have a serious discussion about ending gender bias. We want to believe that we live in a world where our daughters can do anything and be anything. And you'd think they could -- they outnumber boys in college, graduate school and the work force. But what will limit their potential is not biochemistry or ability, but a bias in how women and girls are viewed. Unfortunately, Cheryl Rios' view of women is not unique. Some people believe women have \"our place\" and that place is not at the table. They'll tell your daughter to \"go for it\" but believe she isn't qualified to fulfill her dreams. In a compelling series about women and work, Wharton School professor Adam Grant and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg lay out the startling facts about the bias women face at work and the profound benefit of eradicating gender stereotypes. The evidence of bias is undeniable and the examples are endless. It's overt: There are more men on corporate boards named John, Robert, William or James than there are women on boards altogether. The bias is also covert: When students rate their favorite professors, they describe the men as \"geniuses\" and the women as \"nice.\" The bias is real, yet so many of us are blind to it. Hillary Clinton might not be the perfect candidate, but the fact that she is a woman will make her road to the White House a much steeper climb. That's not just a problem for Democrats -- it's a problem for Republicans, Independents, everyone. The fact is, equality benefits everyone. It's better for the bottom line (companies with more women in leadership roles make more money).  It's great for kids because children with involved fathers are happier, healthier, and more successful. It's great for marriages because couples that share responsibilities have stronger marriages.  And it's great for corporate teams because diverse teams and companies produce better results. Our nation, our economy and our families would be much stronger if half of our companies were run by women and half of our households were run by men. It's not enough to say to our daughters: \"You can be anything you want to be.\" What we need to say is: \"You can be anything you want to be, despite what some people might think -- and what they think is wrong.\" Rios said that if Clinton is elected, she is \"moving to Canada\" because \"a female shouldn't be president.\"  Apparently Rios knows as much about women and leadership as she knows about Canada: Kim Campbell became the country's first female prime minister in 1993. Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Canadians elected their first female prime minister, Kim Campbell.", "reference": "A businesswoman worries that if Hillary Clinton becomes president, her hormones will make her go to war .\nMel Robbins: What's scary is that the bias against women in the workplace is still going strong in 2015 ."}, "239": {"id": "f843fb66ec425eb58453494ff8f838d390b243f3", "article": "YouTube star Cassey Ho has hit back at critics with a powerful and provocative new video, highlighting the cruel comments left by viewers of her fitness-focused clips who accuse the trim and toned online icon of being everything from \u2018too fat\u2019 to \u2018ugly\u2019 to \u2018pudgy\u2019.

But though mean and critical messages may have put a dent in the 28-year-old\u2019s self-esteem, the workout pro is getting the last word with her latest video, The 'Perfect' Body, which examines just whether conforming to society's standards is the key to happiness, while highlighting some of the cruel comments she has received from viewers of her YouTube videos. Scroll down for video. Fighting back: In her new video, Pilates instructor and YouTube star Cassey Ho combats body-shamers who comment on her videos . She's only human: Seemingly full of confidence, Cassey said even she has felt bad about herself after reading nasty comments calling her 'fat' online . In a post on her Blogilates blog, Cassey said negative comments on her videos are nothing new, but the flood of nastiness has grown especially bad lately. She added that the trash-talking has even brought her to tears on more than one occasion. 'It\u2019s hard to be content with the shape of your body when people are constantly telling you how fat you are, how much weight you need to lose, how much weight you need to gain,' she wrote. 'What do people want?' Cassey goes on to explain that, through her new video, fans can see what it's like to face that kind of negativity, and watch as her own self-esteem gets 'stripped away', leaving her feeling insecure and ashamed about her appearance. Fit or fat: The slim and toned blogger says that the negativity in the comments section of her YouTube channel has become especially nasty lately, and has even made her cry . Peanut gallery problems: In the new video, Cassey picks at her body, honing in on places that commenters say she could improve upon . The video begins with Cassey posting a selfie in gym clothes, taken just after a workout. She immediately starts to read the comments, and though they start off positive, soon people are telling her she shouldn't give fitness advice because she is fat. Cassey goes on to strip down to her underwear, examining, pinching and prodding her body, using the spiteful comments to direct her to different parts of her physique that people insist need changing. And as the video goes on, she grows more unsatisfied with herself as negative comments pop up around her. So the YouTube star gets to work, manipulating her body in a simulation of real-life Photoshop. She thins her thighs, hips, and waist, makes her butt and chest bigger, and even changes the color of her eyes. Finally, she posts another selfie of her 'improved' look - achieved with the help of a body double - but she is clearly still unhappy, and she uses this feeling to try and show viewers that giving in to body-shaming will only leave you worse off. Before and after: The fitness expert's body goes under a major transformation; Cassey used a body double to achieve the final look . Moral message: Even after making her butt and chest bigger and her waist and legs smaller, Cassey still doesn't find happiness at the end of the video . No Photoshop here: The retouching in Cassey's video was meant to prove a point - she doesn't use Photoshop in the photos she posts online . It seems that her 'take that' attitude has left her detractors speechless. Readers of her blog flooded the comments section of the latest post with overwhelmingly positive feedback.

A private hospital in Harley Street says that increasing numbers of people are seeking its help after being given bad advice or poor treatment elsewhere. And it says it is now time for the industry to be \u2018taken to task\u2019. A leading private eye hospital is calling for tighter regulations on laser eye surgery after noting a rise in the number of people who have been given inaccurate information or poor care. Up to 120,000 Britons have laser eye surgery each year to correct long and short-sightedness, and almost one in 20 of them suffer some sort of complication.Most operations are done privately, with patients paying up to \u00a35,000 to have both eyes corrected. Last year, the consumer group Which? warned that not all clinics are properly explaining the risks involved. Regret: Law graduate Lois Roberts . Law graduate Lois Roberts said that surgery to correct her short-sightedness left her in agony. She suffered from painfully dry eyes after she had the laser treatment, which was caused by damage to the nerves that stimulate tears. And in the years after the procedure, Miss Roberts said she had to apply eye drops every day to alleviate the pain, which in itself can bring on chronic eye inflammation. Miss Roberts had used contact lenses and glasses since she was at primary school but found they were a nuisance when playing sport. She had the \u00a31,500 treatment as part of her 21st birthday present in 2010. But it wasn\u2019t the pain-free experience she was promised. She said: \u2018I\u2019m upset I wasn\u2019t warned enough at my initial consultation that anything like this could happen. I would have thought much harder about it had I known the risks.\u2019 Miss Roberts, from Gwynedd in North Wales, suffered from poor night vision and \u2018floaters\u2019 in the years after she had the surgery. \u2018The floaters are like clumps of black lines and dots,\u2019 she said. \u2018I\u2019ve been reassured they\u2019re harmless, but they are incredibly annoying.\u2019 Floaters can occur as a result of a popular form of laser surgery in which a flap is cut into the surface of the cornea \u2014 the clear, domed part of the eyeball. Poor night-time vision can occur if part of the cornea has been lasered incorrectly. Despite the side effects, the procedure did correct Miss Roberts\u2019 vision. Its investigation found that one in three consultations by clinics offering the treatment was of poor quality. Now, surgeons are speaking out. They say that despite the term \u2018laser eye surgery\u2019, the procedure doesn\u2019t have to be done by a surgeon or even someone with specialist eye knowledge. Instead, all that is required is that the person doing the operation is qualified as a doctor of some sort. Dr Saj Khan, an eye surgeon at the London Eye Hospital, said the unit is treating more patients who have received unsatisfactory treatment elsewhere than five years ago. And other specialist clinics are seeing a similar rise. Dr Khan added: \u2018At the moment, anybody who has a basic doctor\u2019s qualification could in theory go off and spend a few hours or a couple of days learning how to use the kit and set off giving treatment.\u2019 Bobby Qureshi, the hospital\u2019s medical director, called for a compulsory register of practitioners that patients could use to find a suitably qualified surgeon. He said: \u2018Laser eye surgeons are, at present, only required to be registered as doctors; no specialist qualifications are legally required to carry out a laser eye procedure. The London Eye Hospital in Harley Street said laser eye surgeons are presently only required to be registered as doctors - and no specialist qualifications are legally required . \u2018And with those who trained abroad, it\u2019s even more difficult to establish levels of expertise in specific treatments. This makes a central register all the more important, as it gives patients the tools to check exactly in whose hands they are putting their vision. \u2018We have seen a rising number of people arriving at the London Eye Hospital who have previously been given inaccurate information or poor care and we strongly believe that it is time for this industry to be taken to task.\u2019 The Royal College of Ophthalmologists says complications occur in almost one in 20 cases. These include dry eyes and problems with night vision. It says that severe visual problems are \u2018very unusual\u2019, but some patients require corneal surgery or hard contact lenses to restore satisfactory vision. It advises patients to quiz clinics about how often they perform the treatment and what their success rates are. A spokesman said that while in theory the operation could be done by someone who is registered as a doctor but does not have further qualifications, the likelihood of this happening is \u2018very, very negligible\u2019. She added that the organisation is working with the Royal College of Surgeons to improve standards.", "reference": "Warning comes from The London Eye Hospital in Harley Street .\nComes after rise in patients previously given poor information or care .\nSaid laser eye surgeons are presently only required to be registered as doctors - and no specialist qualifications are legally required ."}, "242": {"id": "28c4ff6e931522468e9f359ebad7b05e0c0bf162", "article": "BMW is recalling 91,800 Mini Coopers to fix a defect that may prevent the air bag on the front passenger side of the cars from deploying in a crash.

Hearn unveiled a cheque with his offer to Sky TV cameras in a bid to force a deal with the IBF super-bantamweight champion, as the Matchroom promoter upped the ante in a bid to book a July 18 date at Manchester Arena. However, Frampton\u2019s promoters, Cyclone Promotions, headed by former world champ Barry McGuigan, released a press release in response to the offer, claiming they were awaiting formal communication from Hearn\u2019s Matchroom Sports before renewing negotiations over the much-hyped bout. Eddie Hearn presents the cheque for \u00a31.5m to set-up Scott Quigg's fight with Carl Frampton . Matchroom Sport boss Hearn said the cheque offered 1.5m reasons for the two boxers to fight . Quigg stares down the camera to tell Frampton to 'put his money where his mouth is' TV rights were believed to be a major stumbling block in negotiations as Matchroom are tied to Sky Sports, while Frampton\u2019s recent title defence against Chris Avalos attracted millions of viewers between ITV in the UK and UTV Ireland. Now Hearn has seemingly attempted to force the fight with a big-money offer in the hope that the bout can be screened on Sky Box Office. While past negotiations were believed to have collapsed due to a failure to agree a deal on future promotional \u2018options\u2019 on fights, the Matchroom promoter also insisted he has not demanded rights to promote Frampton\u2019s future fights. \u2018Nothing at all \u2014 no options, no rematch clause, absolutely nothing,\u2019 Hearn told Sportsmail when questioned on whether such terms were included in his \u00a31.5m offer. \u2018He can have this fight, he can go back to whatever broadcaster he wants [after it].

While undergoing treatment she decided to cut off all her hair after choosing against it on many previous occasions - making a \u2018ten-minute decision\u2019 that she would get a friend to shave it off. But, telling of what happened next, she said: \u2018Feeling proud, I updated my friends on Facebook with the caption \u201cI did it!\u201d - and about two hours later found that someone had reported it for nudity. \u2018It didn\u2019t get deleted but I knew it must have been someone I had as a friend.

Lawyers hired by drug rehab network Narcocon have argued that Trout Run, a property in Frederick County, Maryland, has historic significance because President Herbert Hoover once caught a fish at the site. Opponents view the proposed designation as a trick to circumvent current zoning laws for the 40-acre plot of land and create a drug rehabilitation program that some call dangerous. Narcocon, a Church of Scientology-affiliated drug rehab network, is trying to prove that a patch of land near Camp David is historic enough so that they can build a center for twelve patients . A Scientology-back real estate company bought Trout Run for $4.85million in 2013, and has been trying to change its land designation so that it can build a center that uses saunas and vitamin therapy for addicts . Narcocon, which uses sauna sessions and the teachings of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, has been sued in the past for wrongful deaths.\u00a0It has denied wrongdoing. The group's treatment program claims that megadoses of the vitamin Niacin and spending five hours a day in a sauna for a month eliminates addiction cravings that are stored in the body's fat cells. Treatments at the center can cost more than $30,000 per month and typically last for as long as six months. Narcocon officials, who run more than 120 centers around the world, deny that the program tries to convert addicts to Scientology, though the group prominently features a quote from Hubbard on its website. The organization says that is focused on a secular approach to helping people overcome addiction. Its Maryland center would house 12 patients, with eight staff living there and eight living off-site. However, the current zoning laws for Trout Run, which includes a collection of stone cottages, classify it for resource conservation and do not permit any medical purpose for the site, according to the Washington Post. Though Narcocon says that it is non-religious and does not try to convert people to Scientology, its website features the religion's founder L Ron Hubbard (pictured) prominently . Placing the property on the county register of historic places would allow Narconon to conduct its program. The rehabilitation program was founded in 1966 and is based on the teachings of Scientology's founder L. Ron Hubbard. Narconon claims it is a non-religious, non-profit, non-medical . rehabilitation program with patients around the world. Its methods include . spending up to five hours a day in a sauna for 30 days straight and mega . doses of the vitamin Niacin. The hypothesis underlying the program is . that drugs and their metabolites are stored in the body's fatty tissues . for years, causing the addict's cravings when partially released later . on. But these can be flushed out through a regimen comprising elements such as . exercise, sauna and intake of high doses of vitamins, according to the facility's methods. This hypothesis does not enjoy . mainstream acceptance, and researchers and practitioners tend . to discount Narconon due to its connection with Scientology. No independent study that has not been funded by the center exist to confirm the supposed efficacy of its treatment, which has repeatedly been cited as curing 75 per cent of addicts. Since its establishment, it has faced considerable controversy over the . safety and effectiveness of its rehabilitation methods and the . organization's links to the Church of Scientology. Fees can sometimes reach more than $30,000 per month and centers bring in millions of dollars a year from patients. An aide of Herbert Hoover bought the property in the late 1920s and the president went on fishing trips there,  the\u00a0Frederick News Post\u00a0reported. Narcocon hired a consultant whose history of Trout Run said that Hoover 'reeled in a fine one-and-one-half pound trout' during a visit. 'No President was born or died there. No epic battles were won or lost, no proclamations penned, no foreign dignitaries lodged and feted,' local drug counselor Kristin Milne-Glasser wrote in opposition to the historic designation. She said that the area merits a roadside plaque at most. President Dwight Eisenhower and other Washington elites also fished at Trout Run during his time in office. Frederick County's Historic Preservation Commission ruled that the site is eligible to be voted onto the register because of its early 20th century architecture. Social Betterment Properties International, a real estate company tied to Scientology, bought the land in 2013 for $4.85million from a government official who had long been trying to sell it. Narconon has been working on building its center since. County councilors delayed voting on the measure two weeks ago so they could have more time to review the proposal and plan to grant or deny approval on Tuesday. Beyond questions of history, opponents to the rehab center have cited safety concerns about the mysterious organization being so close to Camp David and Narcocon's alleged checkered past. Celebrity Scientologists such as John Travolta and Tom Cruise have repeated Narconon's message about how it saves 75 per cent of addicts. Trout Run was first built and developed by an aide of President Herbert Hoover (right) in the late 1920s. It is located in a woods several miles from presidential retreat Camp David (left during G8 Summit in 2012) Trout Run in Maryland was used for fishing by President Hoover (right) and President Dwight Eisenhower (left) during their times in office (file photo, Colorado, 1954) However, the organization previously lost its license  in Georgia after the death of \u00a028-year-old former Marine Patrick Desmond, who was being treated for alcoholism but died after allegedly trying heroin for the first time while in treatment. Previous deaths at Narcocon include three young people who  died within a year at a flagship Oklahoma facility, according to\u00a0NBC. Hilary Holten, 21, was found dead in her bed at the center in April 2012 of unknown causes. Stacy Murphy, 20, died of an oxymorphone overdose in July. Gabriel Graves, a 32-year-old father of two, died of unknown causes in October 2011. Narconon denied responsibility for any patient deaths. The group's Arrowhead in Oklahoma was estimated to have brought in $10.88million in revenue in 2011. The group has already approached the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene about acquiring a license for its facility but has not filed an application. Its website says it currently runs 16 centers in the United States, though the only one on the East Coast is in Massachusetts. Narcocon and its rehab network have attracted criticism from residents in western Maryland for its checkered past, though celebrities such as Tom Cruise (pictured, 2004) endorse it .

Forest officials near the town of Tirupati spotted hundreds of smugglers cutting trees for red sandalwood, Rao said Tuesday. The forest officials, who were unarmed, called for police. \"We saw several trees chopped down,\" Rao said said. \"These guys came prepared and were heavily armed.\" Rao said that the ensuing gun battle lasted more than three hours and 20 smugglers were shot. Many of them came from the neighboring state of Tamil Nadu, he said. Amnesty International said the police were claiming self-defense, alleging the suspects attacked them with stone and axes. \"However, no police official was injured,\" the  Amnesty statement said. \"Most of the suspected smugglers were shot in the back.\" According to Amnesty, India's National Human Rights Commission has said the incident \"involved a serious violation of human rights of the individuals,\" and that \"the opening of firing cannot be justified on the ground of self defense since it resulted in the loss of lives of 20 persons.\" The commission has asked senior government and police officials to explain the actions of the police and forest officials within two weeks, Amnesty said.

A British ex-pat has been found hacked to death at her home in South Africa, it has emerged today. Sandra Malcolm's body was found at her Cape Town home by her grandson who reportedly climbed through a window when nobody answered the door. Reports in South Africa suggest the 74-year-old's attackers had mutilated her - although police have yet to confirm this. Mrs Malcolm, originally from Dundee in Scotland, was found on Sunday morning at the Capri Mews complex in the Marina Da Gama area of the city. The pensioner had been planning to return to Scotland next month to visit family in Tayside. She had lived in South Africa for 35 years and is survived by two daughters, three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Her nephew, Colin Chalmers, of Dundee, today said the murder had left the family 'distraught'. 'I'm absolutely gobsmacked, I've never had to deal with anything like this before, it's completely shocking. 'All I know is that my auntie has been murdered, I don't want to court any of the rumours around it because we know very little at this stage.' One neighbour, who asked not to be identified, told reporters they were horrified by the murder. He said: 'This is a quiet community, this is shocking, I still cannot believe it. 'I saw her on Saturday afternoon last. She had some friends over.' He described his murdered neighbour as 'friendly' and 'burly', adding: 'It's so strange because we didn't hear anything, no struggle or a gunshot. 'The grandson, we understand, found her after climbing through the bathroom window. 'I left for church before 10am and I walked past her flat and I didn't hear or see anything. When I came back from church I saw the police vans and they said she had been murdered. 'The family is so shaken they are not in a state to speak.' Details are still emerging of how the pensioner came to be found at her flat. Mrs Malcolm, originally from Dundee in Scotland, was found on Sunday morning at the Capri Mews complex in the Marina Da Gama area of the city (pictured) South African news networks reported that neighbours said the pensioner was last seen with friends on Saturday afternoon. Police in Cape Town declined to comment on the circumstances of her death but said a post-mortem will be conducted to determine the exact cause of death. Forensic experts and detectives  combed the scene for hours on Sunday. Police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk said: 'The motive for the killing is unknown at this stage. A post-mortem will be held to establish the exact cause of death.' The murder comes amid a  wave of anti-immigrant violence in South Africa. Hundreds of African immigrants have fled their homes in the country in recent weeks to escape xenophobic attacks and protests.", "reference": "Reports suggest Sandra Malcolm's body was mutilated by her attackers .\nPensioner, originally from Dundee, was found at her home in Cape Town .\nHer grandson made the discovery after climbing through a window when nobody answered the door ."}, "250": {"id": "3783ef06d42f795f34533caf346c2cb9d3c844dd", "article": "(CNN)A federal grand jury has charged millionaire real estate heir Robert Durst, a convicted felon, with unlawful possession of a firearm. In this week's indictment,  Durst, 71, is accused of possessing a .38 caliber revolver, which authorities allegedly found in his hotel room last month. He faces a maximum of 10 years in prison if found guilty of that charge, according to the indictment. The charge is the latest in a litany of accusations. A Louisiana judge ruled last month that Durst, who is charged with first-degree murder, will be held without bail at a facility near New Orleans. Durst was featured this spring in \"The Jinx,\" a HBO documentary about him. He's accused of killing his friend  Susan Berman at her home in California in 2000. He also faces state weapons and drugs charges in New Orleans. Last month, court documents claimed that Durst had a loaded .38-caliber revolver, marijuana, his passport and birth certificate, a latex mask with salt-and-pepper hair attached and more than $40,000 cash. He also had a UPS tracking number. The package was intercepted by the FBI, prosecutors said, and it contained clothing and more than $100,000 in cash. But the bigger courtroom fight will probably unfold in Los Angeles, where the district attorney filed a first-degree murder charge against Durst last month. He awaits extradition to Los Angeles to face that charge. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. Prosecutors accuse Durst of \"lying in wait\" and killing Berman, a crime writer and his longtime confidante, because she \"was a witness to a crime.\" Berman was shot in the head in her Beverly Hills home in December 2000, shortly before investigators were set to speak with her about the 1982 disappearance of Durst's first wife, Kathleen McCormack Durst. Durst has long maintained that he had nothing to do with Berman's death or his wife's disappearance. It's not the first time he has been accused of murder. He admitted killing and dismembering his neighbor at a 2003 trial, but he was acquitted after arguing that he acted in self-defense. FBI agents have also asked local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where Durst lived over the past five decades, a U.S. law enforcement official said. Unsolved cases in Vermont, upstate New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California are among those getting a new look, the official said. Durst's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, said it's a sign that authorities are desperate. DeGuerin has said Durst has serious medical conditions. He is suffering from hydrocephalus, which required brain surgery a couple of years ago, DeGuerin said. Doctors implanted a stent on the right side of his head, the attorney said. \"At the same time he was in the hospital, he had an operation on his esophagus to remove cancer. So he's got some serious health issues. ... He's lost a lot of weight. He's not in good health,\" DeGuerin said. DeGuerin also said that Durst is \"mildly autistic\" and has received treatment in the past from one of the country's leading experts in Asperger's syndrome and autism.", "reference": "Durst, a convicted felon, charged with unlawful possession of a firearm .\nHe is accused of having a .38 caliber revolver and faces up to 10 years in prison ."}, "251": {"id": "277832f427ae2ef4b7c1001999083d3ccd3dd6ae", "article": "The most popular cities in the world are often instantly\u00a0recognisable thanks to their world-famous landmarks. But what would these cities look like if they did not have\u00a0their\u00a0prized attractions? That's what one studio asked its designers, and the images it received back were certainly illuminating. Scroll down for video . Without the 324m-high Eiffel Tower in Paris, the skyline looks incredibly bare and dark, which is not surprising considering it has 336 lamps illuminating it at night . The iconic tower, on the Champ de Mars, was opened in 1889 and has come to define the French capital . The Arc De Triomphe was constructed in 1806, and is the centrepiece of Place Charles de Gaulle at the end of the\u00a0Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es . The imposing monument celebrates France's military glories and also its military heroes - tourists can climb up tot the roof for beautiful views of Paris . Virtual studio DesignCrowd invited people to submit before and after graphics of some of the most well known landscapes as we have never seen them before. Nearly 100 submissions have been created, with a number of them focusing on the 300m-high Eiffel Tower in their creations . The startling absence of the giant tower left the landscape feeling bare and flat, although it did allow for views from the Trocad\u00e9ro Gardens, through to the Champ de Mars. More missing features in Paris included the impressive Arc De Triomphe. Instead of leading to the famous centrepiece, the multiple surrounding roads meet at a bare, round circle. Without the Statue of Liberty to draw boats of tourists, Liberty Island looks forlorn and barren. All that remains of the island is the paved stone where the iconic\u00a0colossal neoclassical sculpture stood. The Statue of Liberty draws boats of tourists every day, but without the iconic lady, Liberty Island looks nothing special . Siena Cathedral is a medieval church in Siena, Italy that has been around since\u00a01215. Its spires and towers peek over the city . The River Thames looks just like any other river with the elegant Tower Bridge stretching across the waterway . The iconic Tower Bridge is featured in nearly every London tourist shop and often mistakenly referred to by visitors as London Bridge . Designers imaged what London would look like without its most photographed clocktower and Westminster Palace . The Palace of Westminster is more commonly known as the Houses of Parliament, with both the House of Commons and House of Lords based in the Gothic-style waterfront building . London's attractions draw millions of tourists every year, but there would be a lot less photographs taken in the city if Big Ben was not a feature on the skyline. It is said to be the most photographed clock in the world, and would not be easy to remove, sitting at over 13 tons. The sunset skyline looks empty without the impressive\u00a0architecture\u00a0of the Palace of Westminster. The banks of River Yamuna, in Agra, look desolate with the majestic presence of the Taj Mahal . The Taj Mahal is a striking white marble mausoleum in Agra, and brings millions of tourists to the surrounding area . A certain Holy presence is missing from the skyline of Rio de Janeiro, making the normally instantly-recognisable city a little more mysterious . Christ the Redeemer overlooks all the goings on in Rio, and makes the city instantly recognisable . The Sydney Harbour stands out due to its uniquely designed opera house, which resembles the sails of a ship, without it the skyline looks like any other cluster of skyscrapers . The beautiful monastery carved out of red rock in Petra, Jordan, was originally part of a\u00a0Nabataean . The rose-red Petra is Jordan's most prized tourist attraction, and hopefully, being a UNESCO World Heritage Site, will never disappear . Machu Picchu was only rediscovered by western travellers in 1911, leading to the site being excavated and becoming a tourist attraction . The ruins at the Inca settlement of Machu Picchu in Peru have made the area a bucket list favourite . Niagara Falls without the falls is a dry, barren hole, and would not attract the 12 million annual visitors it does today . On the border of the US and Canada, Niagara Falls is actually made up of three separate waterfalls . The designs also featured landmarks outside of typical city backdrops. Without the tumbling 51-metre-high Niagara Falls, the area left behind would not pull the 12 million annual visitors that it sees every year. While the Andes are an incredible sight by themselves, iconic pictures with the ruins at the Incan settlement of Machu Picchu, have made the area a bucket list favourite. Standing at 68m, the\u00a0Obelisk of Buenos Aires would be missed from the urban landscape behind if it were removed .

'You could look at me in a hundred years from now and really get the idea of what pop culture was like in the early 2010s,' he told\u00a0Vice\u00a0last year, adding that the words and phrases he chooses are inspired by YouTube songs, places, and other 'superficial' things.

'If I was indecisive, I don\u2019t think I would write on my face,' he explains. Don't forget this face: Vin likes that his many tattoos make him memorable and thinks they make him a 'myth' and a 'mystery' Adding them up: Vin has 24 tattoos on his face alone, including the words 'guilty', 'play', and 'famous' Before breaking into modeling, Vin worked at a supermarket where he says he 'wanted to die'; now he hopes to build an empire and bring a paparazzi culture to his hometown of Montreal because he is disappointed that the city doesn't have a 'star system'. He also designs\u00a0wallets, which he sells for $98 on his newly-launched website.

Countering President Barack Obama's previous assertion,\u00a0Senator Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, said on Sunday that congressional oversight 'doesn't mean there won't be a deal'. The 62-year-old politician continued: 'We just set in place a process to ensure that if there's a deal, it's a deal that will stand the test of time, that will keep Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.' Making an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Corker  said that\u00a0Congressional scrutiny and approval of any nuclear agreement with Iran is essential to help make sure that the deal is not a bad one. Scroll down for video . Chairman: Senator Bob Corker (pictured), of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has denied partisan politics in Washington DC could derail America's landmark agreement to curb Iran's nuclear capabilities . He said that Congress has a responsibility to scour the details of a final plan - including any classified annexes - and ask the Obama administration hard questions about it, before finally voting on it. 'It's very important that Congress is in the middle of this, understanding, teasing out, asking those important questions,' Corker said. Negotiators announced a framework deal on Thursday. The deal is scheduled to be finalized by June 30. Meanwhile, the Committee is due to meet April 14 to consider Corker's legislation to ensure that Congress debates and signs off on any pact. The bill requires the president to transmit, within five days of reaching a final deal, the text of the full agreement, along with materials related to its implementation. With key elements still to be finalized, the framework agreement sealed by U.S.-led world powers describes a program for stunting Iran's capacity to produce nuclear weapons, while giving Tehran quick access to assets and markets now blocked by international sanctions. In defending the framework and a potential final pact, US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz cited what he called 'unprecedented access and transparency' into Iran's nuclear activities. Argument: Countering President Barack Obama's (pictured) previous assertion, Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, told Fox News Sunday that congressional oversight 'doesn't mean there won't be a deal' These will allow the U.S. and its partner negotiators to know almost instantly should Iran try to evade the oversight, Moniz said during an appearance on CBS' 'Face The Nation. This is a long-term arrangement, he stressed, with requirements lasting a quarter century or more. 'We'll have eyes on the entire supply chain of uranium,' he added on the program. 'Going back to mines, the mills, we'll have continuous surveillance of centrifuge production.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has criticized the framework as deeply flawed and a threat to Israel's very existence. He is urging negotiators to improve the agreement or scuttle it. Other Republicans have echoed Netanyahu's concerns. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, said on Sunday the proposed deal is a bad one - but was the best one Obama could get because the Iranians don't fear or respect him. Response: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left) has criticized the framework deal as deeply flawed and a threat to Israel's very existence. But in defending the framework, US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz (right) cited what he called 'unprecedented access and transparency' into Iran's nuclear activities . He said that he favors waiting until a new president, Democratic or Republican, takes office in January 2017 and then trying again. In the meantime, economic and financial sanctions would stay in place. 'Is there a better deal to be had? I think so,' Graham said on CBS' 'Face The Nation.' But a senior Senate Democrat, Dianne Feinstein, warned that bashing the proposed deal could backfire on Netanyahu. The Israeli prime minister and other critics of the framework agreement have offered no viable alternatives, she said on CNN's 'State of the Union.' Feinstein said imposing more and stiffer economic sanctions would only drive Iran's nuclear program deeper underground and make it more difficult to monitor.\u00a0'I wish he would contain himself,' Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said of Netanyahu.

The preliminary deal,  announced in Switzerland on Thursday, sees Iran agree to not build any new centrifuges for 15 years, and not enrich uranium at the previously secret Fordow site for 15 years. The country also agrees to reduce nuclear-material centrifuges from 19,000 to 6,104, let the IAEA store all the extra centrifuges, give IAEA inspectors access to its uranium mills for 25 years and rebuild heavy-water reactor at Arak so it can't produce weapons-grade plutonium. And it would not build any new heavy-water reactors for 15 years. In return, the West will give Iran relief from nuclear-related economic sanctions 'if it verifiably abides by its commitments', and lift 'all past UN Security Council resolutions on the Iran nuclear issue' as soon as Iran has completed all its promised 'nuclear-related actions'.

A large crowd erupted in cheers as Pemba Tamang was carried out on a stretcher. He was wearing a New York shirt and a blue neck brace, was blanketed by dust and had the look of a deer in the headlights. His rescuer, Inspector Lakshman Basnet of the Nepalese Armed Police Force, said Tamang was responsive and showed no apparent signs of serious injury. He was given an IV drip and rushed from the Gongapur area to a temporary emergency hospital run by an Israeli aid team. The Nepalese rescuers had been working for five hours to locate Tamang after they heard his voice coming from under the debris. Also Thursday, a U.S. special operations forces team rescued 30 people, including three Americans, by helicopter from an area of Nepal called Bamboo Village, according to the U.S. ambassador to Nepal. The group was trapped in the village and living in a makeshift shelter, Ambassador Peter Bodde said. The families had contacted the U.S. government to let officials know where their relatives were stuck, he said. They had no other way to get out of the area, Bodde said. An American disaster response team was also involved in the rescue of the 15 year old boy. The team was at a nearby damaged bus station when it got word that someone might be alive. Andrew Olvera, the head of the U.S. team, said his men rushed over with search dogs and equipment ranging from breaching tools to sophisticated cameras that can probe under the rubble. He said the operation carried enormous risk, as chunks of the collapsed building hung precariously on rebar. Entire floors of what used to be people's homes were visible -- ceiling fans and beds still draped with cotton sheets. It was a mountain of loss and sorrow. \"It's dangerous, but it's what we do,\" said Olvera, who has a daughter and twin 11-year-old boys. \"It's risk versus gain. To save a human life, we will risk almost everything. \"The way the building is, it's definitely a miracle,\" he said. Tamang cried for water in a muffled voice. He had been buried for five days under a building that pancaked. He dodged death because of a motorcycle that shielded him from the pressure of the concrete and steel, according to Basnet. And, Basnet said, he \"survived by good faith.\" Dennis Bautista, who went down to where Tamang was buried to administer medical aid, called the rescue amazing. \"It feels good to be able to help out. I can't imagine what he went through,\" Bautista said. \"He is a brave young man.\" Basnet said once he got closer to Tamang, he tried to reassure him that he would be OK. \"I gave him water and talked to him regularly,\" Basnet said. After Tamang was rushed to the hospital, the US Agency for International Development team continued the search. The possibility remained that someone else might have survived, like Tamang. Other search and rescue teams continued to scour through Kathmandu's rubble Thursday. They are looking for survivors from the magnitude-7.8 earthquake that struck Saturday, killing at least 6,134 people and wounding almost 14,000, according to Nepali authorities. Another 72 people were reported dead in India and 25 in China. In Nepal, 19 of the deaths occurred on Mount Everest, where the quake triggered deadly avalanches. Despite the disaster, Nepali authorities plans to reopen routes up the mountain as soon as next week. Teams are clearing paths and and rebuilding ladders, Tourism Ministry spokesman Krishna Sapkota told CNN on Thursday. Officials are encouraging people who have already received permission to climb this season to go ahead with their plans. As the chances dimmed for finding people alive in the wreckage left by the quake across Nepal, Tamang's rescue boosted hopes for all those who still have loved ones and friends missing. Other people have been saved from under collapsed buildings in previous days, including a 27-year-old man on Tuesday and a 4-month-old boy on Sunday. The Nepali military also released a photo of a dust-caked 11-year-old girl who they said was rescued Wednesday after 90 hours under the rubble. The rescuers, meanwhile, have no intention of giving up looking for more. The 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Olvera said, revised the benchmark for what was thought possible for survival. A man there was miraculously pulled from the rubble after 27 long days. 360-degree view of earthquake zone .

Benitez maneuvered Liverpool back to the Champions League final in 2007, eliminating Barcelona on the way with a win at the Nou Camp, only for Milan to avenge their defeat two years prior with a 2-1 victory. The Spaniard  manipulated another assault on Europe's elite trophy the following year but Liverpool were knocked out in the semi-final by Chelsea. Off-field ownership turmoil derailed Benitez's team and Liverpool have not even threatened to emerge as a challenger for club football's most prestigious competition since. They were eliminated in the group stage of the tournament in 2010, where a third-placed finish resulted in demotion to the Europa League. But Benitez guided Liverpool to the semi-finals of Europe's secondary competition, where a Diego Forlan strike in extra-time at Anfield sent Atletico Madrid to the final, where they beat Roy Hodgson's Fulham. The Spaniard was sacked as Liverpool manager at the end of the 2010 season and Hodgson replaced Benitez, who ended up at Chelsea as interim manager in 2012 via a short spell at Inter Milan. Benitez won the Europa League with Chelsea, beating Benfica in the final, but his stay at Stamford Bridge was always going to be a short one. Benitez often barbed Chelsea supporters while at Anfield and with Jose Mourinho's time at Real Madrid grinding to a halt, it was clear who Benitez was keeping the Chelsea hotseat warm for. Now at Napoli, Benitez finds his future at the club in question due to meandering domestic form. Napoli are currently fourth in Serie A, five points away from the top three (which equals Champions League qualification in Italy) with seven games remaining until the end of the season, when the Spaniard's contract expires. Benitez was not a popular choice at Chelsea but he still delivered silverware with the Europa League . Benitez first won the trophy with Valencia in 2004 shortly before moving to Liverpool . Benitez is out of contract at Napoli at the end of the season and has been linked with Manchester City . Benitez has been linked with a return to England with Manchester City, as Manuel Pellegrini has overseen a feeble attempt at defending their Premier League title, while some Liverpool fans even pine for him to return to Anfield. If Benitez does leave Napoli at the end of the season, he will surely have an array of suitors. He has 12 major honours to his name. Few coaches across Europe posses a record as imposing as his.", "reference": "Rafa Benitez's contract at Napoli expires at the end of the season .\nHe guided the Italian side to the Europa League semi-final on Thursday .\nHe has taken four teams to a European semi-final inside 12 years ."}, "256": {"id": "631b45e55e537eee6bacf8e741c572d3ca0038a3", "article": "Kano, Nigeria (CNN)Hundreds of decomposed corpses were discovered buried in shallow graves in the streets of the northeastern Nigerian town of Damasak this past weekend, according to local officials and a resident. The town had recently been freed from the Boko Haram terror group in a joint Nigerian-Chadian military operation. A provincial government committee was visiting the area as part of an effort to assess the level of destruction in towns that had been in the deadly grip of Boko Haram. \"We found hundreds of dead bodies in shallow graves and on the streets of Damasak during our visit,\" Damasak local government spokesman Babagana Mustapha told CNN on Monday. \"Those bodies in shallow graves have badly decomposed while those found on the streets were desiccated from [exposure to] dry \u200ewinds,\" Mustapha added. The victims included men, women and children murdered by Boko Haram when they seized the area in November, said Abubakar Kyari, a senator-elect for the region. \"The staggering number of dead bodies found in Damasak is a testimony of the large-scale atrocity Boko Haram committed when they were in control of the town\" Kyari added. Mustapha said the bodies were buried in 20 clearly marked mass graves.  Although Mustapha did not give a precise number of corpses recovered, Damasak residents who participated in the exhumations put the figure at more than 400. \"\u200eWe collected over 400 corpses from the streets and in shallow graves during our visit in Damasak,\" said Idris Karimbe, one of the volunteers who took part in the burial. \"The number of bodies we recovered this time around far exceeded the ones found last month,\" said another resident, Musa Bremah\u200e. Bremah was referring to the discovery of around 90 bodies in a shallow grave outside Damasak last month after its recapture. \u200eA regional military coalition involving troops from Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon has in recent months recaptured swathes of Nigerien territory seized by Boko Haram. The joint military operation is part of an ongoing collaborative effort at crushing the Islamist group that has widened its deadly attacks to Niger, Chad and Cameroon.", "reference": "The town had recently been freed from the Boko Haram terror group .\nVolunteer from burial: \"\u200eWe collected over 400 corpses from the streets and in shallow graves\""}, "257": {"id": "390f79b1d8ef4851a1f3eee8375489481069d4c4", "article": "With its gritty blocks of flats, endless kebab shops and quirkily dressed locals, Shoreditch, London's hipster hub, might have been gentrified but it's still the last place you would expect to find a royal.

Needless to say, we were disappointed to see Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr lose at the weekend against Andrzej Fonfara. It wasn\u2019t a result we were expecting and it also blows away the chance of Froch and Chavez fighting in Las Vegas \u2013 a fight Carl wanted. Now we turn to three big fights in the next two months to see what Carl does next. I have held talks with Gennady Golovkin\u2019s manager and there is also the possibility of Bernard Hopkins, but there are three fights coming up where the winner could work for Carl. Carl Froch (left) has not fought since beating George Groves at Wembley last May . Froch has kept in shape and weighs 12st 7lbs - despite being away from the ring for nearly a year now . Froch had hoped to meet Julio Cesar Chavez Jr, but he lost to Andrzej Fonfara last week . There is the possibility of Paul Smith-Andre Ward in the pipeline, Anthony Dirrell versus Badou Jack for the WBC world title and Andre Dirrell\u2019s IBF world title fight against James DeGale, which is the biggest bout of this trio. Anthony Dirrell\u2019s people have already been in touch with me about a Froch fight in the event that he wins, but I wonder if it is big enough. A fight against DeGale still feels to me like the most probable, if he comes through against Dirrell on May 23. That is a huge fight, a proper 50-50, but I fully believe he can do it. For me, from talking to Carl, I think he needs to fight again in 2015 if he is to ever return. If doesn\u2019t come back this year, I don\u2019t think he will. He has been a year out of the ring so let\u2019s see. I know he is going to have an eagle eye on all these fights. The possibility of him retiring is very high but he is still training hard. He is walking around at 12st 7lbs and in the gym four to five days a week. The guy has the hunger but it has to be for the right fight and the right money. My belief is still that it might be DeGale. DeGale has looked sensational in camp and is improving at a brilliant rate \u2013 if he wins the title over in the US he will be in a great position. I mentioned Golovkin before. When I was on the phone to Carl he spent 20 minutes talking about the guy. He is a fighter that absolutely fascinates him; it\u2019s a fight that would get everyone talking. I am looking at it. It would have to be at 168lbs and it would be special. I wouldn\u2019t want to be the one to find out how Golovkin punches at the weight but Carl has a sick mind like that. I\u2019m not going to rule that one out. James DeGale (right) has now emerged as the most likely next opponent for Froch on his return . Another option for Froch could be a rematch with Ward, should the American beat Paul Smith . After a disappointing couple of weeks it seems that my hopes to stage Carl Frampton-Scott Quigg this summer are dead in the water. We received no offers from their side and made three of our own \u2013 we offered a 50-50 split, a 60-40 in favour of the winner and also a \u00a31.5m guarantee to Frampton. I sent that last offer in writing to them and had no response. You ask yourself who is making these decisions? It is life-changing money for Frampton that has been offered. Let\u2019s hope they don\u2019t spend the rest of their lives kicking themselves. Scott will move on and fight on July 18. I can guarantee that in his next fight he will fight a tougher opponent than Frampton will. Scott Quigg (right, in action against Hidenori Othake) will fight on July 18 against an unnamed opponent . Carl Frampton's team failed to make an offer to fight Quigg, according to his promoter Hearn . Hearn went live on Sky Sports to offer Frampton and his team \u00a31.5m to fight Quigg . Anthony Joshua has been added to my May 9 show in Birmingham, where he will fight Rafael Zumbano Love, the South American champion. He is 6ft 4ins and this will be a good test for Anthony against a big man before he then has his 02 fight against Kevin Johnson on May 30. We are keeping him busy, which is what he wants. I saw him in the gym this week and he is looking awesome. After the Johnson fight he will be out again on July 18 in Manchester and then in September in a big fight. Watch this space.

The bride and her grooms: This map shows Barrientos' marriages from 1999 to 2010 . Barrientos' first marriage took place in 1999 to Mohamed Gerbril, followed by a 2001 marriage to Ahmed Allam, then a second 2001 marriage to Habibur Rahman, the Post reported. According to the newspaper, Barrientos married six men in 2002 - namely Davit Koridze, Duran Goktepe, Aliaksandr Paharelau, Vakhtang Dzneladze, Rashid Rajput, and Kakhaber Khorbaladze - and her last marriage was in 2010 to Salle Keita. Authorities reportedly slapped her with offering a false instrument for filing felony charges in November 2014. Quoting court documents,\u00a0The New York Daily News\u00a0said '[Barrientos] ... stated in sum and substance that she did marry Mr. Keita and that was her first and only marriage.' The newspaper reported that Barrientos could be sentenced to a total of eight years stemming from her two charges. Barrientos has been arrested multiple times, including for loitering, drug possession, and jumping a turnstile and trespassing, according to the Daily News. Wedding bells?

The election means that half of the six-member city council in Ferguson, a town where two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black, will now be African-American. This just over one month after the Department of Justice released a report on the shocking culture of racism and abuse in the city. The lone black incumbent councilman, Dwayne James, was not up for re-election. Scroll down for video . Wesley Bell Jr., 18, left, casts his vote alongside his father Wesley Bell who claimed victory in the race for Ferguson City Council Ward 3 seat . The election came\u00a0just over a month after a Justice Department report detailed a culture of racism and abuse among city officials, employees and police . Voter turnout increased substantially from the previous election following a strong get-out-the-vote effort from labor unions and other national organizations. The town that drew only 12.3 percent of registered voters last April had 29.4 percent turnout Tuesday, according to the St. Louis County Board of Elections. That was about double the overall turnout in St. Louis County, where Ferguson is located. Unofficial results showed that Wesley Bell defeated another black candidate to win in the 3rd Ward; Ella Jones defeated another black candidate and two white candidates in the 1st Ward; and Brian Fletcher, a former mayor who is white, won a 2nd Ward race against another white candidate. 'This community came out in record numbers to make sure our voices were heard,' said councilman-elect Bell. 'When you have a community engaged, the sky is the limit.' He described it as part of a healing and rebuilding process. It was the first municipal election in Ferguson since officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed, on Aug. 9. The shooting sparked sometimes violent protests in the St. Louis area, and spawned a national Black Lives Matter movement to press for change in how police deal with local minorities. It also prompted a review by the U.S. Justice Department, which decided not to prosecute Wilson, who resigned in November. But the federal department released a scathing report blasting the city for racial bias and profiling in the police department and a profit-driven municipal court system. Several city officials resigned following the review, including the city manager, police chief and municipal judge. The municipal court clerk was fired for racist emails. The new city council will be tasked with approving hiring of the replacements. The scrutiny in the wake of the shooting also found that the city had a mostly white police force and city leadership - the mayor also is white. Ferguson City Council ward three candidates Lee Smith (R) and Wesley Bell (L) hand out election information . In the race for the 3rd Ward, which includes the apartment complex where Brown was killed, Bell, 40, easily defeated 76-year-old retiree Lee Smith. Bell is a lawyer and a criminology professor who had to defend himself because of a third job - municipal judge in a neighboring town of Velda City that, like Ferguson, derives a large percentage of its budget from municipal court fines. Smith had support of several national organizations whose volunteers went door-to-door on his behalf. Jones had support of a labor union and won easily in her four-person race. Fletcher, the former mayor who started the I Love Ferguson campaign after the unrest that ravaged the community, also won easily in the 2nd Ward. A strong push was made after the shooting to register more black voters last year, but just 562 new voters were added to the rolls. In recent weeks, the focus has been on getting those who are registered to vote. The high turnout came despite brutal weather. Strong storms, including lightning and heavy rain, tore through the region for several hours before noon. But the weather didn't deter Marty Einig, who has participated in Ferguson protests since August. She was voting in the 3rd Ward, which includes the Canfield Green apartment complex where Brown was fatally shot. 'I see there is raw material within this community to demonstrate hope,' Einig said. 'I see a glass that's half full, and I feel that the people have the will to force change.' Charrolynn Washington agreed, saying the election is where real change will occur. 'As much change is needed here in Ferguson, this is where we begin - not out there in the streets, doing what they were doing - but, right here,' Washington said. 'They need to be voting and putting people in position to make the change and make the decisions that need to be made.'", "reference": "Ferguson, Missouri elected three black officials to city council seats on Tuesday, up from one last term .\nBlack officials now comprise half of the city council in the city .\nThis just over a month after a Justice Department report detailed a culture of racism and abuse among city officials, employees and police .\nVoter turnout hit record highs, with 29.4percent of registered voters going to the polls, up from 12.3percent last April .\nThe elected black officials include\u00a0Wesley Bell and Ella Jones, while Dwayne James, the incumbent, was not up for reelection ."}, "262": {"id": "62082b51751794c9a2a25b2e069cc1175470e033", "article": "Leroy J.

The event was broadcast live on state television in Iraq. Al-Douri, 72, headed the Naqshbandi Order insurgent group, an important faction behind the recent rise of ISIS. He was one of Saddam's most trusted henchmen, helping to lead his 1968 bloodless coup.\u00a0Both Al-Douri and Saddam came from the same Tikriti tribal background. His daughter was briefly married to Saddam's elder son, Uday, who - together with his brother Qusay - was killed by US forces in Mosul in July 2003. He was then deputy to Saddam when he was deposed following the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Following the execution of Saddam Hussein on 30 December, 2006, Al-Douri was confirmed as the new leader of the banned Ba'ath Party.

He was ranked sixth on the US military's list of the 55 most-wanted Iraqis after offensive to overthrow Saddam and had a $10m bounty on his head. He was the King of Clubs in the infamous pack of cards the US issued of wanted members of Saddam's regime after its collapse. His dead body was pictured on social media on Friday with his teeth missing, an unkempt orange beard and a bloody head wound. Salahuddin governor Raed al-Jabouri said soldiers and allied Shia militiamen killed him in an operation east of Tikrit - a city that was recaptured by the government two weeks ago. He said: 'This is a major victory for those involved in the operation. He is considered a mastermind for this terrorist group. 'For sure this will have an impact on them...there will be a break among them.' ISIS currently controls a swath of land slightly larger than the UK, from Aleppo to central Iraq. In the invasion of Iraq by a US-led coalition, the military developed a set of playing cards to help troops identify the most-wanted members of Saddam's regime. This was mostly high-ranking members of the Iraqi Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party or members of the Revolutionary Command Council. The cards were officially named the 'personality identification playing cards'. Each card contained the wanted person's address and, if available, the job they carried out. The highest-ranking cards, starting with the aces and kings, were used for the people at the top of the most-wanted list. Saddam, who was number one on the most wanted list, was the Ace of Spades. The aces of clubs and hearts were his sons Qusay and Uday respectively, who were both killed in Mosul in 2003. The ace of diamonds was Saddam's presidential secretary Abid Hamid Mahmud al-Tikriti. He was executed in June 2012 after being sentenced to death by the Iraqi High Tribunal. Al-Douri was the King of Clubs in the pack of cards. However, in recent months Iraqi forces, supported by US-led air strikes, have captured large areas from the terrorist group. But on Friday, a car bomb killed three people outside the US consulate in Erbil, the capital of Iraq's Kurdistan region that is allied with Washington in a war against ISIS, which claimed the attack. No US personnel were hurt in the blast, according to the State Department, which said a 'vehicle-borne improvised explosive device' exploded right outside the entrance to the heavily fortified compound.

Clive Schlee, chief executive of the coffee giant, revealed he has given his staff the power to hand out a coffee on the house to people they like or fancy. 'The staff have to give away a certain number of hot drinks and food every week,' Mr Schlee said. Scroll down for video . FEMAIL writer Deni Kirkova travelled to four different Pret A Manger shops in London to find out what it takes to get a free coffee from staff. Here she is after failing to secure a freebie at their\u00a0Gloucester Road store . 'They will decide \"I like the person on the bicycle\" or \"I like the guy in that tie\" or \"I fancy that girl or that boy.\" So, do the staff at Pret ever take advantage of their enabled good will? And what does it take to secure a free morning caffeine hit? FEMAIL decided to find out. Deni Kirkova, 24, paid a visit to six different Prets across London. On three of the visits, she wore no make-up, her glasses and a casual outfit consisting of jeans and a plain top. Before paying a visit to the next three coffee shops, she amped up the glamour by removing her glasses, applying a full face of make-up and donning a little red dress with a fair share of cleavage and leg on show. Deni then returned to High Street Kensington to find out whether she could bag a free coffee in her glam getup - and went into the South Kensington branch twice to find out if the result would differ depending on whether it was a man or woman serving. Here's how Deni - who didn't tell the staff she was a journalist until after she had been handed her drink - got on... Deni, dressed 'plainly', fails to get a free coffee at Pret in High Street Kensington (l) and Notting Hill Gate . Deni paid a visit to Pret's High Street Kensington, Notting Hill Gate and Queensway outlets, where she tried three different approaches: nonchalant, sad and friendly. Dressed in her casual attire, she popped into High Street Kensington's Pret just as she normally would: making little effort but still being polite. She left with a coffee - and a dent in her purse. At Notting Hill Gate's shop, she decided to put her acting skills to good use. She said: 'It was a fellow female who served me, she was really glamorous herself and I just figured that flirting was out of the question here. 'So, I went for the \"sad\" approach. I told her how bad my day had been and asked her how she was but while she smiled a lot, she still charged me. Feeling annoyed, I paid and left.' At the Queensway shop, Deni was feeling lucky. Makeup-free Deni Kirkova gets a free hot chocolate from friendly barista, Dean, at Pret A Manger, Queensway . She said: 'As soon as I walked in, I had a feeling I would get a free coffee. I just felt more confident and the barista guy looked cool. It wasn't busy so I thought it could work. 'I smiled but didn't try hard and asked how he was. It worked as he called me sweetie! 'I asked for a small hot chocolate and didn't get my purse out. He handed it to me and said \"Happy St George's Day; don't worry about it\".' Deni then revealed that she was a journalist on a mission and asked him to divulge the reason why he gave her a free coffee - and how other people can get one, too.

'The main reason I give out free things - and I have no quota and give out around 300 a month - is when someone is nice,' he explained. 'I am not impressed by the ladies who come in and flirt, batting their eyelids and twirling their hair, nor those who are grumpy and take it out on the staff.' Deni then swapped her casual clothes for her 'glamorous' look and headed to Gloucester Road, where she had to pay for a hot chocolate from a female barista. The same thing happened at South Kensington on her first visit. She decided to try her luck again, this time making sure she got served by a male barista, who gave her a free cookie because of her 'beautiful smile'.

She managed to wangle a free mocha in Victoria station's Pret from a chap named Nacer, who wanted to 'make her day'. Finally, to round off the day, she went back to High Street Kensington to try get a freebie dressed a bit more glamorous - but was made to pay for her espresso. The verdict? Deni said: 'The glam outfit got me more freebies but I don't think it's all about that. 'As Dean said, he's not interested in giving out freebies to girls who come in batting their eyelashes and twirling their hair nor those who come in in a bad mood and take it out on him. 'So don't try to flirt a freebie off a barista or try to make them feel sorry for you - it's all about radiating happiness, a wide smile, and spreading the joy.

From biometric scanning to iPad-controlled hotel rooms, glimpses into the future of travel have already begun popping up in airports and resorts around the world. Here, MailOnline Travel looks ahead at exactly what holidaymakers can expect from flights and accommodations in the future, and attempts to answer the age old question: when will teleportation become a reality? What does the future of travel hold? Think: biometric scanning, sustainable hotels and personalised bookings . By 2030... In 15 years, digital advancements will have made the discovery, planning and booking of a journey into a seamless and intuitive experience. 'Travel search and booking will be as easy as buying a book on Amazon,' explains Skyscanner's CEO and Co-Founder Gareth Williams. Instead of tapping away at your computer to book flights and accommodations, Global Futurist Daniel Burrus tells Skyscanner that in the future, each of us may have an 'e-agent,' inside a watch or small piece of jewellery, that goes everywhere with us. 'It could have the face, voice and personality of our favourite actor or comedian and appear to use as a 3D hologram image, or inside a virtual environment, at our verbal command,' he explains. The travel experience will become much more personalised in the next few years, including using biometrics . While that seems a bit extreme, it's not outside the realm of possibility that the travel experience will become much more personalised in the next few years. Computers, through analysing our searches online and cross-referencing our preferences, will be able to use predictive algorithms to make tailored suggestions. This predictive software, as it's known, will also likely take into consideration the personal data we post about ourselves on social media when developing detailed itineraries. And when we do jet off, it will be even easier than it is today. The flight-booking site believes that major technological advances will have eliminated the need for check-in lines and desks. Instead, you will be able to drop your bag at automated points in the terminal. Forget having to carry a passport, digital scanning technology will make check-in a seamless process . 'Biometric face recognition software and machine-readable passports - incorporating a digital boarding pass - will mean that clearing customs will take less than a minute, and high-speed laser molecular scanners will security check hand luggage in seconds as you walk past them toward the departure lounge without even breaking your stride,' Steve Tooze, special projects editor at The Future Laboratory tells MailOnline Travel. In fact, we may not even need to wait a decade and a half. At Incheon airport in Seoul, South Korea, for example, departures will soon operate a biometric immigration system, using facial recognition and machine-readable passports, and at\u00a0Singapore Changi Airport's T4, which is due to open in 2017, many similar technologies will also be utilised. And while we may see the beginning of space travel by 2030, many expect the hotel of choice to be those located underwater. Though today, underwater rooms are considered a rare luxury, many out-to-sea hotels are currently being developed - such as Dubai's Water Discus Hotel - and will undoubtedly change the  accommodation landscape entirely. Today, underwater hotel rooms are considered rare luxuries, they're expected to become more mainstream . By 2050... Plane manufacturer, Airbus, recently predicted the development of travel trends over the next 50 years and their planes look like something out of a sci-fi film. According to the company, passengers will be able to relax in massage seats that serve drinks and vitamins, as well as provide either a sea breeze or fresh pine scent. Sound showers will help ensure the perfect night's sleep, while special shades will help block out the light. Plane manufacturer, Airbus, believes that planes in 2050 will be made of panoramic windows . Such stunning windows will make for 360-degrees views of the world's wonders and attractions . But if you prefer a view, the plane will also be made up of panoramic windows that can turn transparent at the wave of a hand. And bonus: such a 360-degree view would offer incredible views of world wonders and attractions. Taking a page from some long-haul carriers, bars will also become more prevalent on flights, while pop-up pods will offer private spaces. Airbus research also suggests that every flight in the world could, on average, be around 13 minutes shorter, which would save millions of tonnes of excess fuel annually. In the next few decades, aircraft interiors will bear little resemblance to the packed cabins of today . Bars are expected to become more prevalent on flights, as well as socialisation pop-up pods . 'By the middle of the next decade, aircraft interiors will bear little resemblance to the packed and often frustrating cabins of today,' Tooze adds. 'Memory foam seats will morph to each passengers shape as they sit down, as smart lighting eliminates the effects of jet lag, and sleep hormones sprayed at strategic moments in the flight mean you'll never have to listen to a screaming toddler on long-haul ever again. 'Each seat will have individual climate control and holographic communications and entertainment hubs that allow you to watch films and music from your personal collection on the cloud and chat to friends, family and colleagues as you fly \u2013 and sonic disruptors will stop you disturbing everyone around you.' It's believed that space travel will impact holidays of the future, becoming a reality for luxury seekers . Skyscanner's The Future of Travel Report, however, focuses a great deal more on the ways that space travel will impact holidaymakers' future journeys. By 2030, they estimate that space travel will be a reality for ultra-luxury travellers and perhaps by 2050, it will become even more mainstream. In the report, futurist Daniel Burrus says: 'We will be able to book more affordable trips into space where we can go up there and stay long enough to enjoy.' Whether or not we end up colonising on the moon, Skyscanner's Filip Filipov points out that the possibility of flying in low orbital space will radically cut inter-continental flight times. 'In the case of Virgin Galactic, whose ship can orbit the Earth for 2.5 hours, a regular traveller might see a London to Sydney flight in 2.5 hours if the same technology can be applied safely in commercial aviation.' And if the same technology can be applied in commercial aviation, long-haul flights may cease entirely . By 2100... In the next century, the sky is the limit - quite literally. According to researchers at the Future Laboratory and their new report, Sustainable Holiday Futures, giant airships, man-made mobile islands and intelligent hotel rooms will all be commonplace in the next 100 years. Imagine a coastline with floating resorts that can move from destination to destination. This is precisely the future if Thomson Holidays has anything to say about it. Sustainability will be an 'integral' part of every holiday as early as 2030, the report continues, with some claims that artificial islands may even produce their own food and water. This idea of zero-impact travel, in which resorts may look like cruise ships in the sky, will leave no environmental trace whatsoever. Man-made mobile islands will be commonplace in the next 100 years as will the idea of zero-impact travel . In hotel rooms, everything will be automated and highly-personalised. Many hotels have already begun to roll out iPad-controlled lights, sound and room service features and that will only grow in popularity in the coming decades. But futurologist Ian Pearson predicts the that the hotel room of tomorrow will take this technology a step further. In his opinion, we can expect hotel bedrooms to incorporate pillows with sleep-aiding massage technology and holographic wall systems that will project personal trainers or even friends and family in 3D. And we may not even need planes at all! Teleportation could be a regular occurrence by 2080 . And forget long-haul flights to get where you need to be. Teleportation could become a regular occurrence by 2080, according to Dr Mary Jacquiline Romero from the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Glasgow. 'The good thing about teleportation is that there is no fundamental law telling us that it cannot be done and with technical advances I would estimate teleportation that we see in the films will be with us by 2080.'", "reference": "Skyscanner's Future of Travel report predicts personalised hotel visits .\nBiometric scanning could revolutionise the airport check-in process .\nUnderwater hotels will become mainstream and space holidaying possible .\nAirbus has developed renderings of their panoramic planes of the future ."}, "267": {"id": "60379751b68df6b80dbf0987e8b3739b9e39a0f1", "article": "A Florida man arrested this weekend for pointing a laser at passing cars was later found hiding a bag of marijuana up his rectum, according to police.

Dangerous pastime: Police say Roepcke spent Sunday evening riding around Ormond Beach, Florida, with his fiancee Brandie Tate (pictured) and shining a light in other drivers' faces . Roepcke was then hit with additional charges of possession of marijuana and smuggling contraband into prison. According to an arrest report, officers received a 911 call from a concerned motorist saying that someone shined a laser in her face as she was driving along South Atlantic Avenue, reported The Daytona Beach News Journal.

As Iraqi forces, aided by Shiite militiamen, took control Wednesday of the northern city of Tikrit, they found vehicles laden with explosives and buildings that might be booby-trapped. CNN senior international correspondent Arwa Damon, who was in Tikrit on Tuesday, saw a large mechanical digger packed with explosives that Iraqi forces had to disarm. The troops, she said, were cautious when they entered buildings in case they were wired to explode. Plumes of smoke rose from burning buildings in the background. Near former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's presidential palaces compound -- Tikrit is Hussein's birthplace -- the CNN team also saw a destroyed truck with a large machine gun mounted on the back. Iraqi forces said they had fired an RPG at the truck, killing three ISIS fighters. ISIS was ejected from the palaces compound in fierce fighting, they said, adding that there may still be booby traps. Federal police said they dismantled hundreds of IEDs (improvised explosive devices) Wednesday. CNN heard at least 16 explosions, some very loud, which police said were controlled. The potential booby traps were political as well as physical. Officials are concerned about the behavior of the conquerors, particularly the Iranian-backed Shiite militiamen who helped Iraqi troops. Officials fear the militiamen might take \"scorched earth\" reprisals for the reported massacre of Shiite air force cadets by ISIS fighters in Tikrit last year. Much of the population of Tikrit is, like ISIS, Sunni Muslim. And officials fear that reprisals by Shiite militias against the Sunni population could stoke local anger, jeopardizing the government's ability to hold onto Tikrit and pull the country together. Sectarian resentment helped fuel the rise of ISIS in the first place. 'Where are our sons?' demand families of soldiers captured by ISIS . Still, the liberation of Tikrit from the terrorist group, which is also known as ISIL and calls itself the Islamic State, represented a significant victory for the Iraqi government, which had tried -- and failed -- to retake the city many times before. Iraqi  Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi arrived Wednesday to claim the victory, which took place a year after the city was first attacked by ISIS. Al-Abadi, who is also Iraq's top military commander, had announced the previous evening on Iraqiya TV that the city was under the control of Iraqi forces. Iraqi forces continued to clean out pockets of resistance Wednesday, said Interior Minister Mohammed al-Ghabban, who was also in the city. But he said the Iraqi government would be in full control shortly. \"The enemy has been defeated, and it has lost all its capabilities,\" al-Ghabban said. \"In the coming hours, the battle will end.\" Iraqi security said that the few ISIS militants left in the city are hiding inside houses hoping to escape in the dark. ISIS' nine-month dominion over Tikrit was marked by brutality. In addition to the reported massacre of the 1,500-plus air force cadets at Camp Speicher in June, ISIS is believed to have buried victims in mass graves and to have destroyed an Assyrian church that had graced Tikrit since the eighth century. The push into Tikrit came days after U.S.-led airstrikes targeted ISIS bases around the city. Al-Abadi said those tactics would now be replicated in other areas. Brett McGurk, the U.S. deputy special presidential envoy to the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, tweeted that the coalition's airstrikes had destroyed numerous ISIS shelters. \"We will continue to support courageous Iraqi forces operating under Iraqi command as they work to reclaim their territory from #ISIL,\" McGurk tweeted. The key to victory in Tikrit this time, the Prime Minister said, was surprise. But help from the coalition of Shiite militiamen and volunteers also played a part. The militia members, estimated to number around 20,000, are backed by Iran. The offensive marked the first open participation of Iranian advisers on the front lines in Iraq. The victory in Tikrit sets the stage for Iraqi forces to take back an even bigger prize -- Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. A U.S. official said in February that up to 25,000 Iraqi troops plan to return to Mosul in April or May in an effort to retake the city. Don Melvin wrote this report in London.

Rangers winger David Templeton is full of praise for the impact of new boss Stuart McCall . Templeton says that McCall's training ground methods are superior to the previous management's . 'For me, it's a coaching thing,' said Templeton, assessing the changes under the new leadership. 'We're being coached more and, building up to games, we're working on different formations, which players are going to play, movements, all different stuff, like most teams probably do. 'For me, it has been great, every boy going into a game knows what they have to do, basically. 'The tempo of training, the intensity, everything has been right up and it has been really enjoyable actually, but tough. That's what we needed.' Asked if that was not the case beforehand, Templeton simply replied: 'No.' Pressed to expand, he added: 'I don't think we were being coached the right way. We weren't going into games working on the stuff I think we should have been working on, which we are doing now and that is showing with the results. 'We should probably still have won games that we didn't. But going into games knowing what you have to do does definitely help and I think that showed in the Hibs game two weeks ago. 'We changed the formation and shut out their midfield, their most creative part, and that showed with the result. They didn't create any chances - I don't think Cammy (Bell) had a save to make. That was just through working on things during the week.' Former boss McCoist was placed on garden leave last December with assistant McDowall becoming caretaker manager. He then stepped down when McCall and Kenny Black arrived. Despite his unflattering assessment, Templeton insisted he was not attacking the qualities of McCoist or McDowall. 'It's not that I think it's better coaching,' said Templeton. 'Every coach has a different style. 'The way we were going, we needed to work on things to get back to playing well and defending well. 'We were gifting too many goals and I think that was just through not working on the back four or back three, whatever we were playing.

Insurance giant Admiral said many youngsters addicted to their mobile phones lose out at the very beginning of looking for work - because they failed to string a normal sentence together. Forms saying: 'U r a gr8 company 2 work 4' and 'Btw am out of work atm' are examples hitting their job chances. Young job seekers fill forms with text speak such as\u00a0'U r a gr8 company 2 work 4' and 'Btw am out of work atm' The Cardiff-based insurer with more than 5,000 staff voiced their fears in evidence to the Welsh Assembly's Enterprise and Business Committee that many youngsters failed at the application form stage. An Admiral spokesperson said: 'We do not ask for any formal qualifications, but we expect the spelling and grammar on the application form to be of a certain standard. 'A lot of it is like text-speak, there is no punctuation or upper case. So, that is the first impression that you get.' The committee called on the experience of Admiral, one of the UK's biggest car insurance providers employing more than 5,000 people.

The polls might have the parties neck-and-neck \u2013 but it looks like Sol Campbell is taking no chances. For the second time this year, the former England footballer is selling a multi-million pound property \u2013 leading to speculation he wants to dodge Labour\u2019s mansion tax if the party wins the election. An outspoken critic of the policy, Campbell has even threatened to leave the country if the tax on properties over \u00a32million comes into force. Earlier this year it was revealed he had taken the apparently bizarre decision to sell a \u00a320million London townhouse to a company owned by himself. Land Registry documents suggest the sale was registered the day after higher stamp duty levies came into effect. But it is possible the sale took place shortly before, meaning the increased charges would have been avoided. Now Campbell has listed a second property for sale in the same exclusive neighbourhood of Chelsea. A former home of James Bond author Ian Fleming, the luxury penthouse by the Thames is on the market for \u00a36.75million. Campbell bought it in 2011 for \u00a34.25million after he reportedly staged a sit-in at an estate agents\u2019 in the hope of securing it for his family \u2013 his wife Fiona Barratt-Campbell and their children Isabella and Ethan. It has since been extensively renovated by his wife, an interior designer and granddaughter of Barratt Homes founder Sir Lawrie Barratt. An advert for the property states: \u2018There are few properties within Chelsea that can offer the combination of views, spacious accommodation and exquisite finish.\u2019 Yet Campbell, 40, seems to be keen to rid himself of the flat before the election.

Nice touch: The former Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur defender's kitchen is filled with marble . Sumptuous: Gilded mirrors line the hall in Campbell's luxurious flat, which is in an exclusive neighbourhood . Last year the former Arsenal and Tottenham defender blasted the proposed mansion tax, describing it as a \u2018cheap and easy way to extract money from individuals who have done well\u2019. He told The Times: \u2018With a mansion tax, you\u2019re taxing me for being prudent ... If Labour gets in, I\u2019d leave. I\u2019d have to say, \u201cSorry, I want to ship out\u201d.\u2019 Campbell has also said: \u2018I\u2019m not earning what I was earning five years ago.\u2019 Experts have said that properties worth between \u00a35million and \u00a310million could incur an annual charge of up to \u00a325,000 under a Labour government. Henry Pryor, a buying agent and property commentator, said: \u2018Sellers like Sol Campbell face a financial dilemma: to take a certain hit now or await the potential tax bill that a Labour or Lib Dem Government may generate.\u2019 Since 2009 Campbell has also owned Grade II-listed Hallington Hall, an 18th Century mansion in Northumberland.

Kevin Franklin will light up his Christmas lights on the front of his home tonight for Autism Awareness Month . The 53-year-old father put the lights up on his council house last November in preparation for Christmas. But he didn't take them down in January because he wanted to switch the lights on again in April for Autism Awareness Month. The continued presence of the lights in recent weeks has angered some neighbours, prompting a poison pen letter last month. It read: 'I am fed up of seeing your grotesque tacky council house Christmas lights. It is March, for goodness sake. Your house leaves this lovely community looking a disgrace. 'It looks like a state. It sticks out like a sore thumb. I don't want to keep driving past this eyesore, every time I do, my kids scream.

This will happen throughout April for Autism Awareness Month. 'That was always my plan and it's why, back in January, I decided not to take them down because I knew I would be putting them up again in April. 'I would have taken the lights down after April but now I'm going to leave them on the house out of principle, but I won't be turning them on again until December 2.' The former publican added: 'It's been blown out of all proportion and has turned into a row between council house tenants and those who own their properties. 'Some people think we are scum because we rent, but my house looks a lot tidier than some of those that have been bought by the occupants. 'We are all human beings and the only difference is they have bought their pile of bricks and I rent mine.' He says his nearest neighbours support him in his idea to raise awareness of charities. He added: 'I've even heard some neighbours saying they will donate to charity and I've been told that some people around Dunstable may even put up their own Christmas lights in support.'

In her suit she also alleges that the giant marine mammals are being deprived of food for days while being trained to perform at SeaWorld, and that the chlorine used in their tanks is 'many times stronger than household bleach'. Kuhl's suit details allegations of forced breeding, incestuous inbreeding and whales kept together in ways that make them hyper-aggressive so that they fight and inflict deep gashes on each other. She claims to have witnessed whales 'banging their heads against their tanks and grinding their teeth on the walls, floors and bars until their teeth break or are worn to the pulp, allegedly because of boredom, frustration and ennui,'\u00a0The Guardian reports. This is the second lawsuit against SeaWorld in less than one month, with similar filed in California which accuse the company of 'misleading the public' by claiming that their killer whales are happy. The lawsuit also alleges that the giant marine mammals are being deprived of food for days while being trained to perform at SeaWorld . This follows a failed social media campaign last month, during which SeaWorld organised a Q&A on Twitter using the hashtag #AskSeaWorld. Instead of the intended questions about opening hours, animals and attractions, the company was asked if their 'tanks were filled with orca tears'. Many people used the opportunity to express their anger at the company and questioned its ethics for keeping killer whales and other animals in captivity, often in solitary confinement. User @AshleeCheese_ tweeted: 'Why do you keep breeding whales when you barely have enough room for one? #AskSeaWorld.' Another campaigner @Jennyleeisme followed suit and tweeted: 'Do you really believe Shamu Stadium is the most advanced marine mammal habitat? Have you seen the ocean? #AskSeaWorld.' Animal rights group PETA was quick to make its views known, tweeting a series of photographs of the marine creatures, reportedly showing signs of their distress. The backlash comes two years after the release of the documentary BlackFish, which questioned the conditions orcas were kept in following killer whale Tilikum's fatal attack on trainer Dawn Brancheau at SeaWorld Orlando in 2010. The 80-minute film, which premiered at Sundance in 2013, prompted questions about the ethics of keeping the large mammals in tanks. Since its release, attendance has declined at the company's parks in Orlando, San Diego, California and San Antonio, Texas. SeaWorld's stock value has also plummeted. To counter the backlash, the firm, which has participated in animal rescue programs for more than 50 years, has announced plans to nearly double the size of its orca enclosures in upcoming years.

David McLachlan, prosecuting, said Manohar offered to help Nurse A with her training on December 23, 2013,\u00a0Liverpool Crown Court heard. He said she knew Manohar and, while in his room, asked for his help to learn about matters including chest X-rays. Mr McLachlan said: 'Without any warning Ram Manohar put his hand down her nurse's dress and he put his hands into her bra.' She said he moved his hand around but she had not asked for a demonstration. Nurse A said he later asked her a question about the heart, which she got wrong. She said: 'He smacked me on the bottom quite hard and said to me, \"you bad girl\".' Mr McLachlan said Manohar squeezed her left breast to indicate where her left ventricle was and while discussing breast lumps asked to see her nipple, but she refused. She said the conversation moved onto the femoral pulse. Mr McLachlan said: 'Without any word of warning he put his hand up her dress and down her tights.' Manohar then allegedly touched her inappropriately. Nurse A said he told her 'this type of teaching is only for you' before she left the room 'feeling disgusted with herself'. She later told friends she felt 'violated' before contacting police. Manohar told officers he had known her since working with her at the Royal Liverpool Hospital. He said after a night out she had asked him back to her house, but he had refused. He said she had also asked him on December 12 'to find her a single and smart man because she was desperate'. Manohar said on December 23 she unzipped her top, making him uncomfortable, and followed him around 'like a puppy'. The doctor denied touching her inappropriately and said his office door had been open. He said she had been pointing to different parts of her body and 'if anybody had grounds to complain it would have been him,' adding 'he did not find her particularly attractive'. Manohar is alleged to have inappropriately touched the nurses in 2013, while working at Wirral's Arrowe Park Hospital (pictured).

She said the first time she went to A&E because she had pins and needles in her hands and feet. Nurse B said he examined and touched her genital area. However, she said she thought he had been professional and thanked him before he gave her a hug. She said on October 31 she saw him about a 'very bad headache' and he treated her in a dark room, checking her reflexes before touching her genital area. The A&E consultant claims he had been pointing to different parts of Nurse A's body and 'if anybody had grounds to complain it would have been him,' adding 'he did not find her particularly attractive' Nurse B again thought he had acted professionally and went to the hospital to drop off a thank you card. She said he invited her to meet him for coffee and she went to the hospital for 'a coffee type date' because she did not know he was married.

Mr McLachlan said: 'She stopped him straightaway. He told her that he was married with children.' Nurse B also reported him to the police.

Sambora is said to have made the chilling threat during a blazing telephone argument on March 19. His shaken former flame decided to report the allegation to authorities a week later. Police in the wealthy Los Angeles suburb of Calabasas confirmed to Daily Mail Online that Sambora is a 'person of interest' in an active investigation into criminal threats. Scroll down for video . Everything was rosy between the ex Bon Jovi guitarist and his lover and business partner Nikki Lund last July. But Lund has claimed in a statement to police that Sambora recently threatened her saying he would 'dig a hole in the desert and bury her,' Daily Mail Online can exclusively reveal. The rock star is believed to be on vacation in Bora Bora with his ex-wife Heather Locklear and daughter Ava but faces questioning when he returns. Lund, 33, founded the Nikki Rich clothing line with Sambora and confessed last year that the pair had been having an on-off personal relationship for eight years. When their affair ended it plunged the business partnership into turmoil, just as the duo were preparing to open a boutique on swank Robertson Boulevard. Sambora's alleged threat came just days after Lund launched her first signature solo show at the opening of LA fashion week on March 18. 'They are in the midst of unraveling their fashion business Nikki Rich,' a source told Daily Mail Online. 'Things have become very bitter in recent weeks.

Lieutenant Jennifer Seetoo confirmed to Daily Mail Online that Sambora is a person of interest in the case. Under Californian law making criminal threats can be a felony offence punishable by up to four years in jail. 'A report was taken regarding criminal threats,' Lieutenant Seetoo said. 'It's an active investigation.' A representative of Mr. Sambora said there was no truth in Nikki Lund's claims. 'This is a cluster of fabricated lies in retaliation for Mr Sambora's decision to cease further funding of the unprofitable partnership, plain and simple,' said the rep. Sambora suddenly quit Bon Jovi during their 2013 world tour because of 'personal issues'. The New York Post later reported that Jon Bon Jovi had kicked out his longtime songwriting partner due to substance abuse issues. Sambora and Lund reportedly began their romance in 2006 - a year before his divorce from Dynasty actress Locklear was finalized. Denise Richards dated Sambora . Sambora is believed to be in Bora Bora with his ex-wife Heather Locklear and their daughter Ava .

Estate agents in London are now said to be offering a higher 'Cameron price' and lower 'Miliband price' for the same property. Labour leader Ed Miliband, on the BBC's Andrew Marr show (left), has pledged to introduce a mansion tax on properties worth over \u00a32million. The annual levy will hit his own home in north London (right) Mr Miliband has pledged to introduce an annual levy on homes worth more than \u00a32million to raise money for the NHS. Under plans drawn up by shadow chancellor Ed Balls, homeowners with properties worth between \u00a32million and \u00a33million will be forced to pay \u00a33,000 a year in mansion tax. Owners of homes worth more than \u00a33million will have to pay even more. The Tories have dubbed the proposal the 'homes tax' and warned that families living in much more modest properties could be dragged into the levy. Mr Milliband himself has admitted that his North London home would be hit by his party's planned annual levy. David Cameron, on Sky's Murnaghan show this morning, has criticised Labour's proposed mansion tax as a 'home tax' A Labour government could see people's mortgage bills soar by \u00a31,000 a year, George Osborne has claimed. The Chancellor warned\u00a0warned that the prospect of Ed Miliband propped up by the SNP would lead to a 'clear and present danger' of rising interest rates. Predicting increases in mortgage rates, he said: 'A 1% rise in interest rates would hit the family with the average mortgage with an extra \u00a31,000 bill a year. The price is paid by working people.' The Labour leader lives in a four-bedroom semi-detached house in Dartmouth Park valued at around \u00a32.7million. But if Mr Miliband ever came to sell his home as Prime Minister he could be forced to lower the price to cover the costs of his own mansion tax. According to the Sunday Times, one buyer who is about to exchange contracts on a \u00a315million property in St John's Wood, north London, has threatened to drop his offer to \u00a313.5million if the deal is not completed before May 7 and Mr Miliband becomes Prime Minister. In Notting Hill, west London, a buyer of a property for sale just above \u00a32million has said he will only pay that price only if David Cameron makes it back to Number 10. Miles Meacock, of Strutt & Parker, the estate agent, in Notting Hill, told the Sunday Times that the bidder who had trimmed \u00a3100,000 from their offer for a \u00a32m property, wanted to be sure of permanently avoiding the burden of mansion tax. He said: 'If the Tories win, he will come back to the table. This is likely to be a phenomenon for the next two weeks.' According to the property website Rightmove 77 homes previously listed for sale above \u00a32million have been reduced to below the 'mansion tax level' in the past six weeks.

Patrice Evra was part of David Moyes' failing side last season but he now plays for Italian side Juventus . Hernandez and Ronaldo combined for Real Madrid's winner against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday night, with the former only on loan and deemed surplus to requirements by Louis van Gaal who has instead relied on misfiring Radamel Falcao. Meanwhile, Tevez was leading the line for Juventus, with Evra at left back, in their 0-0 draw against Monaco that won a place in the last four. Pogba is out with a thigh injury but could return in the time for the semi-finals next month. Finally, Pique is enjoying one of the best seasons of his career at centre back for Barcelona and helped keep out Paris Saint-Germain's fearsome attack that featured Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Edinson Cavani on Tuesday night. Cristiano Ronaldo has gone from strength to strength since leaving United and is in the last four once again . Carlos Tevez went to Manchester City between his stints with United and Juventus, who beat Monaco .

Today\u2019s nominee is Petra Wetzel, 40, a divorcee who lives in Glasgow with her son, Noah, nine. She set up her own business, the WEST brewery, in 2006... Listening to the Italian businessman on the other end of the line, Petra could see pound signs in front of her eyes. He had heard about the huge popularity of Petra\u2019s bottled beer. Now he wanted to meet to discuss importing it in bulk to Italy. It was a fantastic opportunity. But, as she consulted her diary, Petra \u2014 who runs one of Britain\u2019s most successful small breweries, knew what her answer had to be. Petra Wetzel, 40 (pictured), is a divorcee who lives in Glasgow with her son, Noah, nine (pictured). She set up her own business, the WEST brewery, in 2006 . \u2018He could only offer me a two-hour slot bang in the middle of my son\u2019s sports day last year,\u2019 recalls Petra. \u2018I had to say No. I\u2019m a businesswoman, but I\u2019m a mum first.\u2019 Blonde, attractive and the founder of one of Britain\u2019s most successful small breweries with an annual turnover just shy of \u00a310 million, Petra may well be every man\u2019s dream. But she says with a laugh: \u2018I sound like a real catch. But the truth is I\u2019m fiercely independent, stubborn and work long hours. The only man in my life is Noah. He\u2019s my priority and the reason I drive myself so hard.\u2019 As a single mother, running a hugely successful business is a tall order. What makes Petra\u2019s success even more extraordinary is that she started her company when Noah was just a baby \u2014 and in the wake of a broken marriage. Petra\u2019s flagship beer, St Mungo lager, is stocked in 100 branches of Waitrose in the UK as well as in branches of Tesco in Scotland. And later this year she is opening a second brewery in Glasgow to cope with demand. The germ of the idea came in 1994 when Petra, who was born in Germany, was having a drink with her father, Herbert, in a pub. \u2018I was studying at Glasgow University and Dad had come to visit,\u2019 she recalls. Petra (pictured) was inspired to start her own brewery when her father visited her Glasgow and she realised that the city didn't have its own brewery . He ordered a pint of local lager, took a sip and winced. Then he asked what the best Glasgow lager was and, to my horror, I realised I didn\u2019t know. \u2018In Germany, every village and town has a good brewery. It\u2019s something people are proud of and want to show off to visitors. He couldn\u2019t believe that a city like Glasgow didn\u2019t have its own brewery. It got me thinking.\u2019 Twelve years later, Petra opened a small brewery and beer hall/restaurant with her then husband, Gordon, with the help of a loan from her parents. \u2018I met Gordon at university and married him in December 2000,\u2019 recalls Petra. \u2018We both had first-class business degrees and, naively, I thought that meant we could easily run a business. I was working as a lawyer, so we agreed Gordon would take charge and I would take a back seat.\u2019 WEST Brewing Company opened in March 2006, just eight months after Noah was born. \u2018He was conceived on a trip to Chicago, where we\u2019d gone to learn about brewing,\u2019 Petra recalls. \u2018I had been told that I could never have children so, although the timing was terrible because of the new business, we were both ecstatic.\u2019 She adds: \u2018We had bills to pay, so I was working three days a week just two months after Noah arrived. With my legal job and a newborn, I didn\u2019t have time to think about the business. Besides, I thought it was in safe hands.\u2019 The WEST Brewing Company opened in March 2006, just eight months after Petra's son, Noah was born. She initially started the company with Gordan, her then husband . However, in October 2006, when Noah was just three months old, Petra\u2019s life went into free fall when her marriage fell apart. \u2018I was so devastated, I decided to step away from the business. I focused on looking after Noah and my job.\u2019 However, in December 2007, a little over a year after the break-up of their marriage, Petra had another shock: the business was in crisis. \u2018Gordon was away when the butcher who supplied our restaurant rang and threatened to set fire to my car,\u2019 she recalls. \u2018It turned out the company owed him thousands. \u2018When I went round to the company\u2019s office. I filled a black bin liner with our unpaid invoices, went home and spent the night going over them. We had debts up to our eyeballs.\u2019 Many women would have quit. But looking at her son, Petra realised she didn\u2019t have a choice. \u2018It was sink or swim. Noah gave me the confidence I needed,\u2019 says Petra. \u2018We had ploughed my inheritance into the business. It was all I had. Besides, I knew I\u2019d hit on a great idea. All it needed was graft to make it work. My parents agreed to look after Noah for seven weeks in Germany. The company went into administration. I called in a brilliant firm of accountants and worked flat out on a plan for the future. Petra (pictured with Noah) says her son gave her the confidence she needed to carry on with the business even after the initial struggles . \u2018It was tough. Noah went into full-time day care and most nights I would still be at my laptop at 1am. Many times, I sobbed myself to sleep. I felt way out of my depth, but I became good at multi-tasking. \u2018I quit my legal job and bought the assets out of the hands of administrators and began building it, single-handedly, into the thriving company it is today. We are now a beer brand as well as a restaurant and beer hall. And our flagship beer, St Mungo lager, is sold worldwide. We are just about to send a consignment to Hong Kong. Of course, I have to make tough choices. I could beat myself up about not being there enough for Noah. I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times he will be in the car and I have to shush him because I\u2019m taking an important call. \u2018But feeling guilty is just a waste of energy. Noah knows he\u2019s my priority. We are a very tight unit \u2014 particularly as his father now lives in America. We have the most wonderful full-time nanny, Helen, who Noah adores, and I spend every second I\u2019m not working with him. \u2018Recently he said: \u201cMum you are a brilliant Mum and a brilliant Dad.\u201d That meant the world to me. \u2018And thanks to the business, we have a great lifestyle. For my 40th birthday I bought us a treat: a speedboat. It\u2019s moored at Loch Lomond and zipping up and down the water at weekends makes a tough working week worthwhile.\u2019", "reference": "There are more and more mothers setting up thriving small businesses .\nThe Mail is asking readers to nominate successful mothers they know .\nThis week's nominee is Petra Wetzel who set up the WEST brewery in 2006 .\nPetra, 40, lives in Glasgow with her nine-year-old son, Noah ."}, "282": {"id": "561dae20bc4529ab2b86206ce478d6a5747b6333", "article": "(CNN)A 110-day cat-and-mouse chase spanning from Antarctic waters to the coast of west Africa had an unlikely end when the crew of an alleged poaching vessel were rescued by conservationists pursuing them. Environmentalist group Sea Shepherd had been tailing the Thunder -- subject of an Interpol \"purple notice\" for suspected fraud and fisheries-related crimes -- since its ship the Bob Barker encountered it in the Southern Ocean several months ago. The pursuit ended early Monday in the Gulf of Guinea, off the coast of west Africa, when the Bob Barker received a distress call from the Thunder. \"We were literally a few hundred meters away; they said the ship was sinking and they were abandoning the Thunder,\" said Sea Shepherd spokesman Adam Burling. \"We invited the crew -- 40 of them -- on board, had a medical officer check them over, provided them with food and water.\" Bob Barker Captain Peter Hammarstedt said the crew rescued from the ship had been handed over to the Sao Tome coastguard early Tuesday. He said he hoped the authorities would work with Interpol to prosecute those operating the vessel. \"We obviously want to see the captain of the Thunder prosecuted for his offenses,\" he told CNN by phone from the Bob Barker, at sea to the west of Sao Tome. Hammarstedt said he believed the Thunder was deliberately sunk to destroy physical evidence of illegal fishing. \"I'm 100% confident that the captain of the Thunder destroyed his own ship,\" he said. Hammarstedt said he had managed to send three crew members aboard the abandoned Thunder before it went down. \"Usually what happens when a vessel is sinking is the master will ensure all compartments and hatches are shut so as to maintain buoyancy,\" he said. \"On the Thunder, all the hatches had been opened, including the hatch leading to the fish hold.\" He said his crew had retrieved computers, mobile phones and other devices from the Thunder that would be handed over to assist any investigation. They had also retrieved a fish from the ship's fish hold, which he said was about a quarter full. He said the fish was a toothfish, the prized stock his organization claims the Thunder was illegally catching when they were encountered in the Southern Ocean. More surprising was the reaction of the captain of the Thunder as his ship went under, he claimed. \"When the vessel went completely under the water, the captain of the Thunder, who was in a life raft at the time, started cheering and applauding, which was very unusual behavior for a skipper who had just lost his ship,\" he said. The pursuit of the Thunder began after the Bob Barker encountered the vessel off the coast of Antarctica, said Burling. He claimed the vessel was found with its nets in the water, illegally catching Patagonian toothfish. The Thunder dropped its nets and left the scene; a second Sea Shepherd vessel that was brought in to retrieve the net found about $3 million of toothfish catch in about 72km of illegal gillnet, he claimed. \"That's why they're out there in these shadowlands, these unpatrolled remote regions,\" he said. Meanwhile the Bob Barker, supported by a second Sea Shepherd vessel, pursued the Thunder all the way to the Gulf of Guinea. During that time, Burling claimed, the Bob Barker narrowly avoided being rammed by the fishing vessel, while its smaller boats were struck with grappling hooks. The rescue had gone smoothly despite the months of tensions between the two vessels, said Burling. \"We worried what they might be like to our crew, whether they might be hostile or violent to us,\" he said. But the Indonesian crew who made up the majority of those on board the Thunder seemed \"very relieved\" to be rescued. The officers -- who he believed were Spanish -- were less so. \"Perhaps they would have preferred to have been rescued by someone else, but given the location there was really no other option,\" he said. An Interpol \"purple notice,\" released at the request of New Zealand in December 2013, put out a global call for information on the Thunder, as well as information on \"the individuals and networks that own, operate and profit from the illegal actions of the vessel.\" It said the vessel had changed its name, national registration and other characteristics a number of times to avoid detection of its illegal fishing activities, and had sailed under the names \"Wuhan N 4\" and \"Kuko,\" and under the flags of Nigeria and Mongolia. The Interpol notice said it had \"conflicting information\" about the identity of the vessel's current operator, but said it had previously been registered as owned by companies in Spain, the Seychelles and Nigeria. Interpol confirmed Tuesday that the purple notice remained in place. It said it had monitored the situation and noted that all the vessel's crew members were safely ashore. \"Interpol does not conduct investigations itself; however, we remain available to support any national law enforcement authorities with jurisdiction in this case if such assistance is requested,\" it told CNN. It said no requests had been received as yet.", "reference": "Sea Shepherd rescues the crew of an alleged poaching ship it had chased for 110 days .\nThe conservationist group had pursued the vessel since it was found illegally fishing off Antarctica, it says .\nSea Shepherd captain tells CNN he believes the ship was deliberately sunk to destroy evidence ."}, "283": {"id": "eaca088714c0b7aecc7cfc1706169dfe439ccb39", "article": "England international Ben Morgan has delivered an encouraging fitness bulletin as he continues to recover from a season-ending injury and retain the hope of keeping alive his World Cup dream. The Gloucester No 8 has not played since breaking his left leg during an Aviva Premiership game against Saracens in early January. But the signs suggest he is on course to play a part during England's World Cup warm-up period ahead of the tournament kicking off in mid-September. Ben Morgan is hopeful of featuring for England at the forthcoming World Cup despite his long-term injury . Morgan last featured for England when he scored two tries during their victory over Australia five months ago. Injury then struck, and he missed the entire RBS 6 Nations campaign as a result. The 26-year-old, though, remains an integral part of England boss Stuart Lancaster's World Cup plans, and the current prognosis is a good one after Morgan recently underwent final surgery to remove a pin from his leg. 'To be honest, I have not found this difficult at all,' said 27 times-capped Morgan, after watching his Gloucester colleagues continue their preparations for Friday night's European Challenge Cup final against Edinburgh. 'I am really positive and using this as a great experience to make myself better for when I come back. Who else gets six months off to rest up and train hard? 'Yes, I will be at a disadvantage in terms of the fact I haven't played any rugby. 'But looking at the World Cup in particular, there will be lads who wouldn't have played for probably two and a bit months going into the first (warm-up) game, so everyone is going to be on an equal playing field. 'Things are going well at the moment. I am just trying to make sure I get back healthy when I come back. Gloucester No 8 Morgan broke his left leg playing against Saracens in the Aviva Premiership in January . 'I have a lot of strengthening to do around my legs - in the early stages you don't want to rush that. When things strengthen up, that's when I can start chucking some serious tin around. 'I had an operation last week. It is a case of seeing if things affect my ankle, and if they don't, then I can do them again. 'It is very reactive. I just have to take it day by day. It could be a couple of weeks down the line or a couple of months down the line when I run again, but there is no point rushing this sort of thing.' Lancaster is due to name a 45-man World Cup training squad next month, followed by his final 31-man group for the tournament in late August. England's World Cup preparations, meanwhile, also feature home and away games against France in August, plus a September appointment with reigning Six Nations champions Ireland at Twickenham. Morgan last played for England during his side's victory against the Wallabies at Twickenham in November . Reflecting on the injury, Morgan added: 'It was tough, but it was one of those things. It happens - deal with it. 'If I start thinking about what I missed out on, I'm just going to become negative. I have this mindset going forward about living the law of attraction. 'It is basically positivity breeds positivity. If you get that positive mindset, you attract everything into your life that is positive. I'm thinking of this as a positive experience. 'I can get bigger, better, faster, stronger and improve myself as a player before I come back. I can use this to my advantage. Otherwise I could sit there and fester and get fat, lazy and never come back. 'I sat in the hospital and thought to myself 'okay, it's done. How long is it going to take me to get back?'' 'Ideally, I would like to be back playing in those warm-up games because that gives me a shot of getting in the squad. 'There are so many variables about what can happen, though. 'I might get a couple of months down the line and think that realistically I'm not going to get back, so think about next season instead. I have to look after myself. 'Yes, I desperately want to get back and put myself in contention, but I'm not going to do anything that is detrimental to my health.

Attorney General Eric Holder waved to Justice Department employees during his farewell gathering in Washington on Friday, ending six years at the DOJ . Holder shook hands and received hugs from well-wishers on his last day as attorney general . Newly confirmed Attorney General-designate Loretta Lynch will take over from Holder, following a months-long delay of her Senate confirmation vote \u2013 which passed on Thursday with 'yes' votes from 10 Republicans . The event also included a tribute video prepared for the occasion that featured members of Congress, former President Bill Clinton and Holder's wife, Sharon Malone. In it, Holder described an 'emotional attachment' to the department and recounted efforts to protect civil rights, prosecute terror suspects in federal court and change the criminal justice system. Other clips showed President Barack Obama showering Holder with praise on the day Holder announced his departure. Holder, a former judge and U.S. attorney who took the job in 2009, will exit the department as the third-longest serving attorney general in U.S. history. He has not publicly announced what he'll be doing next. After Lynch, 55, is sworn in at the Justice Department on Monday, she is likely to continue some of the same agenda as Holder as the Obama administration draws to a close. But she is expected to bring to Washington her own management style and has spoken optimistically about having cooperative relationships with Congress following years of bitter feuding with Republicans who saw Holder as overly political and once held him in contempt. Holder's tenure was in many ways defined by his efforts on civil rights protections. His department challenged state laws that it saw as restricting access to the voting booth and refused to defend the constitutionality of a federal law banning recognition of gay marriage. Holder also pushed for changes in the criminal justice system, directing prosecutors to sharply limit their use of harsh mandatory minimum sentences and championing alternatives to prison for nonviolent drug defendants. Though Holder sees civil rights as a defining element of his legacy, his early years largely centered on national security concerns as the country confronted several terror plots, including a failed effort to blow up a Detroit-bound airliner on Christmas Day in 2009. MOBBED: Holder's jubilant reception from his staff was the polar opposite of his treatment at the hands of congressional Republicans . Media advocates criticized the Justice Department's aggressive stance in news media leak investigations involving national security cases, and human rights groups expressed frustration when the department failed to bring charges over harsh interrogation tactics of terror suspects. One area where he has professed vindication is in his plan to transfer terror suspects from the Guantanamo Bay detention facility to the United States for prosecution in the federal court system. The plan was abandoned amid congressional opposition, but since then, the Justice Department has pointed to successful terror convictions in American courts even as the military tribunal system has slogged along without major results. On Friday, he called that debate 'dead' and settled and said it was now clear that civilian courts could adequately handle national security investigations.", "reference": "Holder took a victory lap in his farewell speech, claiming credit for overseeing a 'golden age' of federal law enforcement .\nNo mention of being held in criminal Contempt of Congress for failing to hand over subpoenaed documents related to the Operation Fast and Furious scandal .\nStanding-room-only crowd rushed to embrace him after his final address .\nLoretta Lynch, a Brooklyn-N.Y. federal prosecutor, is Holder's replacement ."}, "285": {"id": "1ad46ddbbdfd0774acfbf473853956b5a0309f15", "article": "More than 1,000 crimes have been created by the Coalition in a frenzy of law-making \u2013 including a ban on washing clothes in Trafalgar Square.

The NDRF was set up in the wake of the Second World War, and at its peak in the 1950s, the fleet consisted of nearly 2,280 ships moored across the United States. But as the need for the fleet has diminished, so has the number of vessels, and today, just over 120 ships remain, posing a risk to the environment in the bays where they are moored.

The ships, jokily known as the 'Mothball Fleet', is so rarely used that many of the ships are falling apart, creating naval graveyards rather than emergency fleets. At its height in 1950, the NDRF consisted of 2,277 ships at eight anchorage sites: James River, Virginia; Beaumont, Texas; Suisun Bay, California; Stony Point, New York; Wilmington, North Carolina; Mobile, Alabama; Astoria, Oregon; and Olympia, Washington. Out of these eight, only James River, Beaumont and Suisun Bay exist today. Long years of neglect and disuse have turned these ships into near wrecks, with flaking paint polluting the waters with heavy metals and hazardous chemicals. The worst affected is the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet, where less than 50 ships remain. At its peak, in 1952, the bay had 340 ships anchored. Today, less than 50 ships remain, slowly polluting the bay, which is a critical environmental area for fish and wildlife. The federal Maritime Administration has pledged to dismantle the fleet at Suisun Bay, with 25 ships in the worst condition taken out within two years and the remainder to be scrapped by the end of 2017.

The federal Maritime Administration has pledged to dismantle the fleet at Suisun Bay, with 25 ships in the worst condition taken out within two years and the remainder to be scrapped by the end of 2017 . The NDRF was established to serve as a reserve of mainly merchant vessels to be activated for national defense and national emergency purposes. The vessels can be activated within 20 days to four months, in order to provide shipping during national emergencies, either military or non-military, such as commercial shipping crises. Throughout its first thirty years, the\u00a0National Defense Reserve Fleet vessels were activated to help transporting coal and grains in times of shortage, and ships were brought in during the Korean War, the 1961 Berlin crisis and the Vietnam War. After the fall of Saigon in 1975, the\u00a0National Defense Reserve Fleet was augmented by the Ready Reserve Fleet (RFF) to provide for military emergencies. Since then, ships have been activated to support U.S. troops and transport cargo in the Gulf War in 1990 and aided in several humanitarian disasters in the new millennium. In 2005, four National Defense Reserve Fleet ships were used for relief operations in the aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and five years later, six were used in the wake of the devastating earthquake \u00a0in Haiti. Its most recent operation took place in the wake of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, when two National Defense Reserve Fleet training vessels were called in. As of April 30, 2014, only 122 vessels are left in the NDRF, and their numbers are reducing still.

Vladimir Putin gave the go-ahead for the deal, with the defence ministry saying it was ready to supply the S-300 missile equipment \u2018promptly\u2019. The move is likely to anger both the U.S. and Israel at a time of heightened tensions between the world powers and following a landmark deal on nuclear weapons. Moscow blocked deliveries of the surface to air missiles to Iran in 2010 after the United Nations imposed sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear programme, barring hi-tech weapons sales. Russia yesterday lifted a ban on supplying Iran with the air defence S-300 missile system (above), which could be used to protect nuclear sites . But the Russian president lifted the ban after Tehran struck an interim deal with Britain and five other countries to curb nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. The framework deal, reached this month, intended to significantly restrict Iran\u2019s ability to produce nuclear weapons, while giving it relief from international sanctions. The negotiations have been heavily criticised by Israel which has warned against Iran having any nuclear activities. Russia signed the \u00a3545million ($800m) contract to sell Iran the S-300 missile system in 2007, but later suspended their delivery because of strong objections from the U.S. and Israel. Vladimir Putin (above) gave the go-ahead for the deal, with the defence ministry saying it was ready to supply the  equipment . The contract to deliver the system was heavily criticised by Israel and the U.S., who feared it could be used to protect Iranian nuclear sites. When it was cancelled, Iran filed a lawsuit with a court in Geneva, seeking \u00a32.7billion ($4bn) in damages for breach of contract, but the court has not yet issued a ruling. Moscow said it had no choice but to annul the deal when the UN imposed sanctions, outlawing the sale of advanced weapons. Despite the sanctions, Russia and Iran have remained close allies. The deal on Iran\u2019s suspected nuclear activities is supposed to be finalised by June 30. There is no firm agreement on how or when to lift the current sanctions. The announcement comes as the U.S. slammed Russia for flying a fighter jet close to a U.S. reconnaissance plane in an \u2018unsafe and unprofessional manner\u2019 last week. Pentagon spokesman Mark Wright said the U.S. was filing a complaint to Russia after the incident over the Baltic Sea, in the international airspace north of Poland. The U.S. crew believed the Russian pilot\u2019s action were \u2018unsafe and professional due to the aggressive manoeuvres it performed in close proximity to their aircraft and its high rate of speed\u2019, Mr Wright added. Russian officials reportedly denied their pilot did anything wrong. The incident was not first time the U.S. protested to Moscow what it considered to be an unsafe intercept.

But that iconic photo\u00a0opportunity has been consigned to history after a Swiss town bans selfies with the giant rescue\u00a0dogs. Zermatt in the Upper Valais area of Switzerland has imposed the ban after a report from an animal welfare charity alleged the dogs were kept in 'miserable conditions'. Scroll down for video . Posing with dogs like these St Bernards has now been banned by the Swiss town of Zermatt . According to the Swiss Animal Protection Agency, the St Bernard dogs are being kept as tourist props by a company in the town that treats them very badly. The organisation has carried out investigations into the conditions the dogs were being kept since 2012 and published a report earlier this year. The report said said when they were not being taken out on excursions with tourists, the dogs \u00a0were being kept locked up in confined conditions in an unheated condemned building for long periods of time. It claimed the dogs are left without food or water in foul smelling conditions and are not given enough exercise. When they are put on show, \u00a0the dogs are kept in the cold for long periods of time and quickly grow tired while posing for photographs, sometimes with children riding on their backs. The organisation has been calling for the town council of Zermatt to ban the use of the dogs for many years. In a statement, SAP said the town's decision showed it 'loves the animals'. Zermatt, under the shadow of the Matterhorn is a popular tourist desitnations . It said: 'SAP rejoices that the town of Zermatt has now taken action to ban taking pictures of St Bernard dogs in its territory. 'Zematt has shown that it loves the animals and it will put an end to the contemptible and dangerous shows these dogs were made part of by being used as tourist props. 'For several years, the SAP, and its section working in the Upper Valais have criticised the conditions in which these animals are kept, and time and time again, has complained about those who keep the animals in captivity, for their violation of laws on the protection of animals. 'The SAP will continue to do all its can to make sure these dogs, which at the moment are housed in a condemned building in miserable conditions flout animal protection rules, are kept in comfortable conditions that meet their needs. 'The SPA is offering its help on the condition those holding the owners decided to put these dogs in better accommodation after they have been used purely as objects for hire.' The mayor of the town, Christophe B\u00fcrgin, told Swiss radio station Walliser Bote: 'No Saint Bernard dogs will be used for photo shoots with tourists on the peaks of Gornergrat and Sunnegga. 'We have been able to convince providers that it is not right to continue to offer pictures in that way.' He said over the summer a few dogs might be found because of long-term contracts with tour operators but the practice will be stamped out by next winter. In March the association filed a legal complaint against the St Bernard owners, claiming that the dogs\u2019 living and working conditions were abusive.

Less than 24 hours after the devastating diagnosis, the 51-year-old married father of two and grandfather unexpectedly succumbed to the deadly disease. For the past eight years, Scott had taught special education and social studies at Cass High School and was the school's head basketball coach. Sudden death: Less than 24 hours after\u00a0Georgia high school basketball coach Greg Scott (left) was diagnosed with leukemia, he succumbed to the illness . Mentor: For the past eight years, Scott (pictured right with his son) had taught special education and social studies at Cass High School and was the school's head basketball coach . Towering figure: The teacher and sports coach was universally remembered as a deeply caring, wise man who was committed to his students and players . But those who knew him, including his colleagues and players, say there was much more to Scott than his love of sports. False hope: Initially, Scott (pictured with daughter Cieanna) and his family were told that his leukemia was treatable . Greg Scott, 51, a basketball coach at Cass High School in Georgia, likely had contracted a fast-moving type of leukemia, known as acute myeloid leukemia, months before his death but was diagnosed only a day before he lost his brief battle with the illness. Leukemia is a type of cancer that starts in cells that form new blood cells. These cells are found in the soft, inner part of the bones called the bone marrow. In patients who suffers from AML, the cancer grows quickly, and if not treated, could be fatal in a matter of months. With acute types of leukemia such as AML, bone marrow cells do not mature the way they're supposed to. These immature cells, called blast cells, just keep building up. Because it is \u2018acute,\u2019 this type of leukemia can spread quickly to the blood and to other parts of the body such as lymph nodes; liver; spleen; brain and spinal cord, as well as testicles in men. This type of cancer is considered rare and has a five-year survival rate of only 24 per cent. AML can be treated with radiation, chemotherapy stem cell transplant, but like with other types of cancer, early detection is key. \u2018He was more about teaching kids how to be good people,\u2019 Principal Mike Nelson told Atlanta Journal Constitution. \u2018He wasn\u2019t worried about winning or losses.\u2019 A spokeswoman for the Bartow County Schools said Scott had fallen ill a few weeks ago and was diagnosed with pneumonia. After a week off for Spring Break, the coach returned to work Monday but still was not feeling well. The 51-year-old school staffer took a sick day and sought medical treatment. Tests showed that the father of two had leukemia - a potentially terminal cancer of the blood. He was taken to Northside Hospital that day, where he suddenly passed away Wednesday morning. Coach Scott was described in glowing terms as an active member of the Cass High School community who was always willing to lend his colleagues a helping hand. Bobby Hughes, Cass' head football coach and longtime friend of Scott\u2019s, said his unexpected passing devastated the entire school. Scott\u2019s former player and assistant coach Drew McKaig told The Daily Tribune News the 51-year-old had made an enormous impact on the lives of students and colleagues alike. \u2018He would talk to them. He would encourage people and pick them up,\u2019 McKaig said. \u2018Just him being a mentor to me and always talking to me, the one thing he always emphasized was not only wins and basketball games.\u2019 The young assistant coach said that when Scott was transferred to the hospital Tuesday, he went to visit him. He remembered that the cancer-stricken man seemed determined to beat the disease. \u2018He kept saying, \u201cAll I can do is fight it,\u201d\u2019 McKaig recalled. Initially, Scott and his family were told that his leukemia was treatable, but the reality turned out to be much bleaker. \u2018He fought, but you can\u2019t win every game,\u2019 McKaig said. \u2018You can\u2019t win every battle.\u2019 Following his passing Wednesday morning, Scott\u2019s heartbroken players and students took to social media to mourn their loss.

Scientists quizzed more than 5,000 British teenagers about their drinking habits and the films they had watched from a list of 50, including Bridget Jones' Diary and Aviator. Those who had watched the most films which featured characters drinking alcohol were 20 per cent more likely to have tried alcohol and 70 per cent more likely to binge drink. Danger: Young people who watch films where characters drink alcohol (such as The Hangover) are more likely to binge drink . The research also revealed that between 1989 and 2008 almost three quarters of popular UK box office films depicted alcohol use - but only six per cent were classified as adult only. Lead author Andrea Waylen, from Bristol University, said children were not getting an accurate perception of drinking \u00a0- and called for films to be rated by alcohol content. She said: 'Alcohol is a drug and it has potentially adverse effects, not only for individuals but also for family and friends. 'It's not very often that we see the adverse effects of alcohol portrayed - like vomiting, rotten hangovers. 'In my view, we don't really get an accurate representation of what alcohol is like.' The research is the latest installment from the Children of the 90s study. It involved 5,000 British 15-year-olds who were questioned on a variety of topics in the mid-2000s. They were asked which films they had seen from a list of 50 popular releases the researchers had already watched \u00a0- and had added up the minutes in each film that showed alcohol use.

They were also twice as likely to have alcohol-related problems than those less exposed. The study concluded that the current rating system was not adequate for parents trying to limit their childrens' exposure to drinking.

'Kids are more likely to identify with consuming characters in films where alcohol use is made to look cool, get you friends, win the girl or boy.

Corey Jones said he suspects that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama want immigration reform because it would result in a new generation of grateful Democratic voters \u2013 and he plans to ask her about it on Tuesday . Kirkwood Community College's outpost in rural Monticello serves hundreds of students, including some who are still high school juniors and seniors . Corum declined to be photographed, flashing an impish grin. Corey Jones, a graphic design student, is among those chosen to question Mrs. Clinton in a roundtable setting on Tuesday. He said his teachers chose him to join a group of 'from 6 to 8' students whowill participate because 'I pay attention to politics,' something his friends around a table agreed with. 'I didn't know Hillary Clinton was running,' one young woman said. 'Is she running? Go ask Corey. He's up on all that stuff.' Jones said he plans to ask Hillary about illegal immigration. 'It's \u2013 well, Immigration reform,' he told Daily Mail Online. 'You know, Obama's plan was to make the illegal immigrants legal.' 'She's part of all that. And some people think \u2013 well, I think maybe \u2013 it's just a tactic to have more Democratic votes'\u00a0from millions of grateful new citizens. Jones, like Corum, will vote in his first presidential election next year. He said Clinton is holding her first campaign event at a community college 'because she's trying to appeal to youth, to young voters.' 'She announced it on YouTube. That's targeted at people my age, right?' Clinton set off on a 1,000-mile road trip Sunday in her home town of Chappaqua, New York, and headed to Iowa \u2013 where the nation's first primary caucuses will start the machinery that chooses major parties' presidential candidate. She announced Sunday afternoon that she was officially in the race. A female student who declined to be named speculated about Clinton's motives for taking ground transportation instead of a jet aircraft. 'Can you imagine if she stepped off a private jet in Des Moines or Iowa City and walked down a set of steps in realy expensive shoes and a thousand-dollar outfit?' she asked. 'That would be, um, a really bad idea. I like the van better. Is it a minivan? God, I hope it's not a minivan.' Future chef Ross Vander Peut said gay marriage is a 'deal-breaker' for him but worries that Hillary Clinton 'seems like, kinda like a control freak' Monticello, Iowa is a sleepy farm town whose main street is lined with shops sporting signs that look like relics from the mid-twentieth century . Most students in Monday's random sample chose not to talk about Mrs. Clinton. All of the will be old enough to vote next year for the first time in their lives. Three said they didn't have an opinion about the Democratic front-runner. One looked up, shook her head, and put a pair of earbuds on. Two more said they would rather remain silent. 'You know, it's that \"If you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all\" deal,' a young woman offered from behind her tablet computer. Moments later a group of young men walked down a hallway mimicking Bill Clinton's infamous 'I did not have sexual relations with that woman' press conference \u2013 and laughing uproariously. One who would talk is Bri Parks, a speech and psychology student who wants to be an FBI profiler because she likes 'trying to figure out how the human brain works.' Clinton can work to earn her vote, Parks said. 'If I heard her opinions and liked her ideas, I would support her.' But 'I hope people don't vote for her just because she's a woman.' Asked for the nicest thing she could say about Mrs. Clinton, Parks said 'she's not going at this saying, \"Look, I'm a woman, so vote for me.\" She's not using her sex to prove a point.' 'She's looking at herself as a politician, not as a woman.' Students like these gathered in a Kirkwood Community College lounge and spoke with Daily Mail Online before and after classes on Monday . Bri Parks, a Kirkwood Community College student, said she hopes Americans don't vote for Hillary Clinton 'just because she's a woman' 'I don't think we should be putting people in extremely high political positions because of race, sex, or whatever,' Parks explained. 'Then you're doing things just because of what people look like.' Kirkwood serves between 22,000 and 26,000 students taking college-credit courses at sites in seven Iowa counties, according to a school official. The Monticello outpost is canceling many classes on Tuesday, making some students scratch their heads since 'this is the smallest part of Kirkwood,' as one pointed out. 'They could have had it somewhere else.' As it is, Kirkwood's students who do have class will have to dodge Secret Service agents and TV news cameras to get through the lobby. Some of them are recent high school graduates while others are finishing their 11th- and 12th-grade years collecting college credits one day per week. Ross Vander Peut, a self-described future chef, is one of the youngest. He's 16, a high-school junior, but will turn 18 just before the election. Vander Peut described himself as a libertarian \u2013 'I like government to leave me alone,' he said \u2013 and gay marriage is 'a deal-breaker.' 'Equal rights, homosexual rights, it's one thing I will not sway on,' he told Daily Mail Online. 'If you are against gay marriage, you've lost my vote. There's nothing you can do to change it.' He hedged on Hillary, saying she 'seems like, kinda like a control freak.' 'But she also seems very strong-willed and determined. When she wants something done she probably does it herself.'", "reference": "Daily Mail Online spoke to ten students at Kirkwood Community College's satellite campus in rural Iowa where Hillary Clinton will be Tuesday .\nOne student is among those picked by teachers to question the former secretary of state .\nHe wants her to comment on his suspicion about immigration reform \u2013 that Democrats are pushing the policy because they need new loyal voters .\nAnother predicted that 'she's going to be, like, talking s**t' and would 'push some emotional thing on us'\nA third said Clinton 'seems like, kinda like a control freak'\nOne more said 'I hope people don't vote for her just because she's a woman'\nSchool has cancelled many classes Tuesday to accommodate Clinton, the Secret Service and the press hordes expected to show up ."}, "298": {"id": "11389d4d81ab5ac12b2f4fcbe67f6f7b69bdf37f", "article": "George Osborne dodged questions over plans to offer more help to the country's top earners . Labour and Tory politicians have come to blows over the 45p top tax rate following the Chancellor's admission that establishing the threshold was not one of the Government's priorities. George Osborne has avoided calls to rule out further help for the country's top earners, offering vague answers when asked whether those raking in more than \u00a350,000 could see the rate lowered. Instead he says the Conservatives are committed to raising the tax-free personal allowance bracket from \u00a310,000 to \u00a312,500. Raising 40 per cent tax so that it only applies to those earning at least \u00a350,000 was also a\u00a0priority, he said. At present anyone earning between \u00a331,866 to \u00a3150,000 is taxed at the higher rate.\u00a0Those earning above \u00a3150,000 are taxed at the higher rate of 45 per cent. But Labour politicians are calling for the amount to be raised to 50 per cent for those in the highest bracket. Accusing the current Government of prioritising 'helping the very richest', Shadow chief secretary Chris Leslie condemned the Chancellor's refusal to rule out offering reduced tax rates on high income salaries. When pressed in an interview with Sky News the Chancellor refused to rule out making further cuts for Britain's top earners, instead saying the issue was 'not a priority'. 'If that was our priority or our plan we would have made it part of our plan and made it one of our priorities. Scroll down for video . 'That's not our plan. Judge us by what we want to do and what we want to do is increase the tax-free personal allowance to \u00a312,500 so people full-time on the minimum wage don't have to pay income tax and millions are better off,' he said. 'And when it comes to higher rate taxpayers our priority is increasing the threshold at which you pay that higher rate, the 40p rate, to \u00a350,000.' 'Those are our big tax commitments for the coming parliament.' The Chancellor added that any deal between Labour and SNP would harm the country, claiming the latter's leader, Nicola Sturgeon, was 'much stronger' than the opposition leader . He also refused to commit to devoting 2 per cent of the budget to defence, the limit agreed by NATO members. David Cameron has faced repeated calls to commit to spending 2 per cent of the budget on defence . 'We made a commitment at Nato. We are spending it today. We have made a clear commitment to the future of the equipment budget, to increase that in real terms ..,. and we have made commitments on the size of the armed forces,' he said. 'I don't think anyone should be in any doubt ... about our commitment to strong national security'. He also said any deal struck between the SNP and Labour would harm the country, lambasting First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's attempts to broker such a partnership as 'disturbing'. 'The fact that the Labour Party, that was a party that campaigned for the Union in the referendum, is contemplating an arrangement with the SNP, who want to break up the country, is deeply disturbing.' He added the Scottish nationalist leaders were 'much stronger' than the opposition leader who he said would be overrun if they entered a coalition together. 'That would be bad for the entire United Kingdom, bad for the integrity of the Union but also bad for our economy because it would mean higher debts and higher taxes.' He also accused Ed Balls of 'running scared' by not agreeing to a debate with him and Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury.

Under the terms of the settlement, the state DMV is changing its policy on how male and female license applicants may dress or wear makeup in their official photos. Agency employees will also get training on how to handle transgender customers and people who don't identify with either gender. Transgender teen Chase Culpepper, 17, who was born male but identifies as female, was told by DMV officials that she had to remove make-up (left) for her license photo last year (after taking off make-up right). After a legal battle, the policy has been changed and Miss Culpepper was allowed to wear makeup for her ID . The 17-year-old transgender teen won her legal battle against\u00a0the state DMV to appear in her license with make-up and jewelry . Chase Culpepper, 17, who was born male but now identifies as female, regularly wears makeup and androgynous or women's clothing. After passing a driving test last year, she was told by officials at a DMV office in Anderson, about 100 miles northwest of Columbia, to remove her makeup because of a policy that bans license photos when someone is purposefully altering his or her appearance. After several attempts, Culpepper says the makeup was removed to the satisfaction of DMV employees, and a license photo was ultimately taken, a process the teen called degrading and humiliating. Culpepper and the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund, a New York legal defense group, wrote to DMV officials, asking that Culpepper be allowed to take a new photo. They eventually sued the agency, calling the policy unconstitutionally vague. In a release from the defense fund, Culpepper said she was pleased with the settlement, which also includes a requirement that the DMV officially apologize to her and allow her to take a license photo with her everyday makeup. 'My clothing and makeup reflect who I am,' Culpepper said. 'From day one, all I wanted was to get a driver's license that looks like me. Now I will be able to do that.' Under the settlement, the DMV also agrees to alter its policy to allow people to wear makeup in photos regardless of their gender. DMV officials on Wednesday declined to comment, saying the agency's policy is not to discuss any litigation, even after a settlement is reached.

Ahead of the match at City\u2019s Academy Stadium we tell you everything you need to know. Dominic Solanke (second right) scores for Chelsea against Shakhtar Donetsk in the UEFA Youth League final . WHAT\u2019S THE OCCASION? It\u2019s the first leg of the FA Youth Cup final and it\u2019ll take place at City\u2019s 7,200-capacity Academy Stadium, in the shadow of the main Etihad Stadium and part of their \u00a3200m Etihad Campus that opened last year. The match kicks off at 7.45pm and will be shown live on ITV4. The second leg takes place next Monday at Stamford Bridge. HOW DID THE TEAMS GET THERE? City started their campaign with a 2-0 win over Oxford United in the third round just before Christmas, with goals from Marcus Wood and Bersant Celina sealing a comfortable win. Jason Wilcox\u2019s team really had their shooting boots on in the fourth round, thrashing Coventry City 8-2. Brandon Barker was the star with three of them, while Thierry Ambrose (2), Pablo Maffeo, Javairo Dilrosun and Denzeil Boadu also cashed in. Man City's Thierry Ambrose (centre) scores his second goal during the 8-2 victory over Coventry . Manchester City's Isaac Buckley Ricketts (left) celebrates scoring during the semi-final against Leicester . It wasn\u2019t as straightforward in the next round, with a solitary Celina strike beating Stoke City, but City were back to their free-scoring best in beating Crewe Alexandra 6-1 in the last eight. Having fallen behind early on, City stormed back to win thanks to goals from Aaron Nemane, Barker (2), Boadu, Celina and Ambrose. That set up a two-legged semi-final with Leicester City and they were very keen to get the job done, winning the home first leg 3-0. Nemane (2) and Boadu continued their scoring form. The second leg at the King Power Stadium was a formality and, having fallen behind to a second-half penalty, two goals in stoppage time from Isaac Buckley and Barker sealed a 5-1 aggregate win. Chelsea started their campaign at the beginning of December and were drawn away to Leeds United. An Izzy Brown penalty and a late second from Dominic Solanke got the Blues Youth Cup defence underway. Huddersfield Town were beaten 6-1 in the fourth round, with England under 18 star Solanke scoring a hat-trick. Tammy Abraham grabbed two and Kasey Palmer rounded off an emphatic win. And Joe Edwards\u2019 team went goal crazy again in the fifth round, beating Swansea 6-0. This time it was Abraham scoring a treble and Solanke adding two. Palmer also got on the scoresheet. A tough trip to Newcastle United followed but the Blues finally prevailed in extra time with Brown, Solanke and Abraham on the scoresheet in a 3-0 win at St James\u2019 Park. That set up a tasty semi-final tie with Tottenham and all seemed lost when Spurs took a 2-0 lead from the first leg at White Hart Lane. Chelsea were to fall further behind in the second leg at Stamford Bridge but mounted an extraordinary fightback. Izzy Brown (centre) scores for Cheslea against Tottenham as they staged a thrilling comeback last month . Goals from Solanke and Brown gave them hope before the break, before two in two minutes from Solanke and Charlie Colkett just after turned the game on its head.

The last of those saw them defeat Chelsea 3-1 at the Etihad after a 1-1 draw in London. Slovakian Vladimir Weiss was the star performer. He went on to make just five first-team appearances for City and now plays, aged 25, for Lekhwiya in the Qatari Stars League.

WHAT ARE THEY SAYING? City coach Jason Wilcox: \u2018Our job is to recruit local lads. If we can get a group of Manchester-born lads into the first team then that's the ideal scenario. To do that is going to be really difficult but that's the challenge. We don't want local lads playing for Tottenham, Arsenal or Chelsea.

Landmark Developments Ltd tore down a derelict property in Bath city centre and replaced it with a modern block of 14 flats. But residents complained that the development was three feet higher and four feet wider than the plans approved by the council. A brand new \u00a34million apartment block in Bath (pictured) is facing demolition - because it is four feet wider than approved . Bath and North East Somerset Council says the developer has committed a 'breach of planning control' and ordered the building to be bulldozed. Dr Douglas Bernardt, a local resident with a PHD in architecture, described the situation as 'madness'. He said: 'I don't know how it was possible that things have got to this stage. 'Lots of money will have been spent on this and I can't understand why it was built different to what they had permission for. It's total madness. 'Architecturally I think there is nothing to complain about. The flats look nice, it's not aggressive to look at.'

He said: 'Late in the design process the building\u2019s insurers insisted on the introduction of a steel frame which resulted in the increase in width, and improved noise separation increased floor thicknesses adding to the height.' Planning permission for the development at 43 Upper Oldfield Park was granted in 2009 following three rejections since 2007.

Bath and North East Somerset Council says the developer has committed a 'breach of planning control' and ordered the building (right) to be bulldozed . The average price of a two-bedroom flat in the area is \u00a3289,000, meaning the 14 flats would be worth at least \u00a33.9million on the open market. In October last year - as the building neared completion - residents complained that it differed from the  approved plans. Bath and North East Somerset Council halted construction and ordered Landmark Development to apply for retrospective permission. Planning officers said they thought the work was 'acceptable' and said permission should be granted. But the council's Development Control Committee disagreed and rejected the proposals on April 17, giving the developer six months to demolish the building. Architect David Hadfield submitted this drawing of the development showing the approved height and width in grey and the existing building in bold . The committee said it felt the development was 'harmful' to the character and appearance of the conservation area. Landmark Development is appealing against the decision and a  meeting will be held next week. Marc Willis, who is the developer's planning consultant, described the council's decision as 'unreasonable'. He said: 'The report suggests the complete demolition and it must be done within six months. The developer is very concerned and is doing everything to stop it. 'The planning officers said the plans were okay, but the council said no. The idea that they have ignored the officers is just wrong. 'We have been in constant dialogue with the council. Demolition goes well beyond what is needed to remedy the issue. 'There are 14 flats which should be on the market now, but you can't move in without planning permission.

He continues: 'Now, I will say that why he was here with me, I made sure my hands were on the steering wheel, I made sure to speak very politely as I always do. I did what he told me to do. 'I handed him the information and I sat here and waited and turned my music down.' The officer left Mr Stack's car for a few minutes, before walking back and returning the documents to him. He then explained the proper use of the median to Mr Stack, telling him it 'needs to be open for emergency vehicles'. 'I was in the wrong, I didn't realize it. I did it out of habit,' Mr Stack admits. After acknowledging the officer's words, Mr Stack, a former Psychology student at the University of South Carolina, was given a warning and both him and the cop went their respective ways.

But she warned Ukip supporters should vote Tory to keep Ed Miliband and Nicola Sturgeon out of power. She told Sky News: 'If we want to stop Labour and the SNP I think you\u2019ve got to vote Tory. A vote for Ukip would be quite wasted I believe. 'I know Ukip are not going to like hearing that, but if they\u2019re honest they would say the same things as well because they\u2019re not going to get enough seats to wield any power. 'I think they\u2019ll get four or five seats, maybe.' She praised Ukip leader Nigel Farage, adding: 'You can\u2019t knock him.' But she warned how other candidates have given the party a bad image. She said: 'There is free speech (in the party) but some of the stuff that comes out from some of the Ukip people. 'I mean no normal person in the street could accept that and I think that is their downfall. 'They could offer some great things to the British public had they sat down and done it right and they weeded out the bad and brought in more people through the ranks.' The former boxing promoter, who stood as the party's candidate for London Mayor in 2004, has just undergone a full gender re-assignment. Speaking about transgender people, she said: 'We are probably where the gay community was 25 years ago and we can learn a lot from them. 'But it would be nice to hear political parties speak up on civil rights and gender issues.' Mr Farage last night dismissed the criticism. He told Sky News: 'There is a fear about Labour and the SNP and that\u2019s why I\u2019m talking to you from Hartlepool because whats happened over the last couple of weeks is there is a strengthening in the Ukip polls and its all coming from Labour. 'So the way to stop Labour/SNP coalition is for Labour voters to switch and vote for Ukip.' When Miss Maloney was standing to London Mayor, she caused controversy by claiming there were 'too many gays' in Camden. She apologised for the homophobic remarks when she addressed Ukip's spring conference in February this year. The criticism is a blow for Ukip leader Nigel Farage who had hoped that Miss Maloney's backing would help to change the image of the party . Mr Farage will today campaign in Hartlepool, where he thinks the party has its best chance of winning in the North East at the election. The seat has been put on Ukip\u2019s list of top ten targets. Other seats outside of the south of England on the list are Great Grimsby, Boston & Skegness, Dudley North and Heywood & Middleton. Mr Farage last night said he believed Ukip could 'smash up' Labour's 'one-party state' in the North. In an article for MailOnline he said Mr Miliband's party 'simply do not understand' the impact mass immigration has had on people's lives. He accused shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna of calling Ukip racist because Labour is 'running scared' of Ukip. Ukip\u2019s strategists believe the party could come second in at least 100 seats in the North. In 2010 the party failed to achieve even a single second place.

'We won't relent 'til it's 100 per cent,' the women sing in a tongue-in-cheek refrain that repeats throughout the PSA. Scroll down for video .

'In the past three years, only 93 per cent of films were directed by men, and only 80 per cent were written by them,' the actresses, including Meryl Streep\u2019s actress daughter Mamie Gummer, say at the beginning of the video. They go on to note, completely dead-pan, that in 2014, 'only' 88 per cent of box office hits featured a man in the leading role. 'Sadly', they say, 'only' 70 per cent of speaking roles in films are also given to men, and women 'get to be naked' in movies twice as often as men do. The problem exists even on the Broadway stage, they point out, with 13 out of 13 plays last year being written by men. Speaking up: Actress Mamie Gummer (pictured, in a photograph by Nadia Quinn) sings in the video that it's 'only fair that men should have it all', not just 80 or 90 per cent of an industry . Far-reaching issue: Though the actresses highlight gender inequality in Hollywood, they also point out similar problems in government and Fortune 500 companies . Rita, who is known for her roles in Sleepless in Seattle and Runaway Bride, looks distressed as she lists the unfavorable\u00a0statistics. The video comes just weeks after Rita revealed her battle with cancer and double mastectomy. Now, the actress, who has had devoted husband Tom Hanks by her side, is making more headlines for speaking out about another issue that effects women, this time in the film industry. But while these actresses have a particular interest in Hollywood's status quo, they insist that 'showbiz' isn't the only place where there is startling gender inequality. 'Men make up only 88 per cent of Congress, 80 per cent of governors, 95 per cent of Fortune 500 CEOs, [and] 97 per cent of creative directors in advertising,' they continue.

The word suggests travelling with a worry-free, devil-may-care attitude. But in the world of mobile phones, where roaming means using your device abroad, that approach is unwise. Making calls, downloading emails and browsing the internet when in another country can result in very large bills. So how can you keep roaming costs down? The best option is to be with mobile operator Three. Its customers can call and text UK numbers and use data in some countries at no extra cost to their UK price plans. Three is the only operator to offer this arrangement, which it calls Feel At Home. Three's Feel at Home covers 18 destinations in Europe, Australia, the United States, Asia and the Middle East . In September 2013, when Three introduced Feel At Home, it covered seven destinations. I said then that to be a game-changer it needed to expand the service to more countries \u2013 and it has. With Spain and New Zealand added earlier this month, it now applies in 18 countries. In Europe, the deal also covers France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Ireland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland. Elsewhere, it covers Australia, the United States, Hong Kong, Macau, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Israel. Given that Spain, France, Italy and the US are among the most popular destinations for Britons, Three claims that about two-thirds of its customers\u2019 overseas trips are now covered by Feel At Home. A word of warning. Three publicises Feel At Home by saying that it enables you to \u2018use your phone abroad at no extra cost\u2019. But to call or text non-UK numbers \u2013 imagine you are in Spain and you phone a restaurant in Barcelona \u2013 you will be charged extra, at roaming rates. However, these are much lower than other operators\u2019 standard rates in some countries \u2013 for example, 15.6p per minute to call local numbers in the US, Australia and New Zealand. There are some other caveats, too \u2013 one being you can\u2019t \u2018tether\u2019 (use your phone to connect another device to the internet). Check all details on three.co.uk/feelathome. Nonetheless, if you\u2019re travelling to a Feel At Home country, using Three is the most preferable option. When travelling, operators\u2019 bundles/ add-ons usually offer better value than their standard rates . Take roaming in New Zealand. On their standard rates for pay-monthly customers, rival operators charge up to \u00a31.50 a minute for making and receiving calls, 35p to 50p for sending a text, and up to \u00a38 per megabyte of data usage. In EU countries, roaming charges are much lower as they are capped. On operators\u2019 standard rates, you\u2019ll pay about 18p or 19p per minute to make a call, 5p per minute to receive a call, 5p to 6p to send a text and 20p per megabyte of data. If you\u2019re not with Three and are heading to a Feel At Home destination, operators\u2019 bundles/ add-ons usually offer better value than their standard rates \u2013 though it depends on your usage levels. To give one example, Vodafone lets you use your UK\u2019s plan allowance for calls, texts and data for \u00a33 a day in Europe, and \u00a35 a day in some countries further afield. However, you will need to actively sign up to get this deal. If you have an unlocked handset, you might consider investing in a local, country-specific SIM card: see 0044.co.uk, uk2abroad.com or dataroam.co.uk for details.

At the end of the trail they staggered into Bennett, a makeshift city of tents, hotels and saloons at the head of a deep green fjord, where they settled for a brief respite. All that is left of Bennett today is its split-log chapel and station, still used by the White Pass Railway. 'On May 29, 1898 more than 7,000 roughly hewn rafts set sail,' Keith told me. 'There was a further 400 miles of hazardous waterways, canyons and rapids to negotiate before they reached their goal.' Everything in the Yukon is of epic proportions. Bordering Alaska, it is almost twice the size of Britain, with ranges of sparkling snow-crusted peaks, emerald lakes and vast forests. There are few signs of habitation in this pristine wilderness, with only a few roads linking the small communities. Spectacular snowfield: Wendy flew over the world's largest non-polar icefield in the Kluane National Park . Distances between them are mind-boggling. Locals travel up to 100 miles for their weekly shop, and some days I drove for seven or eight hours along deserted highways, rarely passing another vehicle. In the Kluane National Park, I took a scenic flight over the world's largest non-polar icefield. We skimmed barren hillsides, almost touching the curly-horned Dall's sheep balanced on the rocky outcrops. As we soared higher, I looked down on immense snowfields before we swooped over glaciers. Kluane is home to a huge grizzly bear population, so one morning I set off in search of them with retired ranger Brent Liddle and his dog Blue. Carrying pepper spray for protection, he led me around a beautiful turquoise lake and up towards the saddle of King's Throne Mountain. Clapping hands to warn of our presence, we scrambled along a rocky path, stepping over tangled roots and clambering over fallen logs. Kluane is home to a huge grizzly bear population (left). Right, some of the original Gold Rush prospectors . Suddenly Brent pointed to a spruce tree. The bark was worn away and fresh hairs were glued to the sap. 'A bear has been rubbing his head and back here,' he explained. Eyes darting in all directions, we proceeded cautiously but there was no sign of the grizzly. I was quite relieved. In fact I saw more wildlife along the roadside than I did on foot, sometimes stopping the car only yards from black bears guzzling on dandelions among carpets of fireweed and blue lupins. At Tombstone Territorial Park we pulled in to watch caribou grazing on the tundra and beavers paddling to their lodge, mouths crammed with twigs. Unless you stay at one of the designated campsites, accommodation in the parks is limited. My favourite was the Tagish Wilderness Lodge - a speedboat whisks you across a lake on a 45-minute journey from the nearest road. Four log cabins are hidden in the trees, yards from the water's edge. The main building consists of a spacious living area decorated with moose and caribou antlers, luxury bathrooms and a pine-scented sauna. Dawson City, epicentre of the Gold Rush, was the largest city in Western Canada back in 1898 . Wendy pans for gold.. and finds a precious nugget . My hosts, Gebhard and Sarah, took me on boat trips along the shoreline and hikes up into the hinterland, passing their heatsensor camera on the way. In the evenings we'd upload the photos showing a lynx, bear and wolf prowling past. I loved the sense of isolation. I spent hours on the jetty watching speckled loons diving for fish. Occasionally a young moose would venture tentatively into the water nearby while bald eagles flew overhead. The views were breathtaking and the silence so intense I could hear a pine needle drop. My last stop was Dawson City, epicentre of the Gold Rush. In 1898 it was the largest city in Western Canada. Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it looks much the same, with painted weatherboard houses and wooden boardwalks lining unpaved streets. Archive film in the visitor centre shows the city crowded with prospectors in dark suits and bowler hats. Now the restored buildings stand hugger-mugger with rusty, corrugated-iron shacks sinking slowly into the ground due to the permafrost. Head to Diamond Tooth Gertie's if you want to watch can-can shows or play blackjack with tourists from the cruise ships. I preferred The Pit, the bar in the Westminster Hotel, where I had a beer with locals and listened to live country music. Just a couple of miles away in Bonanza Creek, I met up with Sylvia and her sister, Ginny, who are both descended from an original prospector. Their site at Claim 33 was close to the spot where Skookum Jim made his historic find. Handing me a pan of gravel, Sylvia demonstrated how to sieve and sluice it. As I shook the pan back and forth, dipping it in water to drain off the excess sand, I stopped short. A tiny nugget was glistening in the bottom of the pan. I had found my own crock of gold.

The unlikely images of Mr Farage come after the Prime Minister and his Lib Dem deputy Nick Clegg were also snapped on the campaign trail posing for photographs with mothers and their babies. In the last few days alone the Prime Minister has been pictured cuddling babies, brushing his daughter\u2019s hair and even feeding an orphaned lamb.

Mr Cameron was heard quipping: 'Come on darling, maybe another one?' The Prime Minister, already a father of four, later admitted he could not help thinking about having more children when he was around young babies. After sympathising with the couple about sleepless nights he said: 'Whenever I see a small baby I feel broody, but don't worry, nothing is going to happen on that front.' Today, Mr Cameron stopped for lunch with supporters near Poole in Dorset, while Mr Clegg spent the day campaigning in South West London and Bath. Mr Farage, meanwhile, sent an email to Ukip supporters pleading with them to help him regain the momentum in Thanet South. Mr Farage asked his supporters to do \"him a personal favour\" and join him on an 'Action Day' to help deliver leaflets, adverts for Ukip public meetings alongside canvassing on the doorstep. Mr Cameron was joined for lunch in a garden with the Docherty family from Poole as he ramped up his campaign for re-election with an attack on Labour's tax plan .

The home side laid siege to the Thistle defence at the start of the match but had to rely on a Kris Commons penalty a minute before the break to give them the interval lead. Thistle midfielder James Craigen had been shown a straight red card by referee Willie Collum for a 'last man' foul on Hoops midfielder Stuart Armstrong to concede the spot-kick. leaving the visitors a player down for the second half.

Midfielder Stefan Johansen, stand-in skipper in the absence of suspended Scott Brown, added a second in the 63rd minute as the encounter turned into a Hoops procession. With second-placed Aberdeen beating Inverness 1-0, Ronny Deila's side maintained the gap over the Dons but also have a game in hand as the title race draws closer to conclusion. With a heavy schedule in mind, the Hoops boss returned midfielder Nir Bitton, Gary Mackay-Steven and striker John Guidetti his starting line-up. Thistle manager Alan Archibald was forced into one change with forward Kallum Higginbotham coming in for the injured Kris Doolan but he was mostly a spectator as the Firhill defence was forced to withstand an early Hoops' barrage. Celtic came close twice before two minutes had elapsed. Stefan Johansen doubles Celtic's advantage in the 63rd minute with left-footed shot into the bottom corner . Johansen is mobbed by his team-mates following his second-half strike . Parkhead defender Virgil van Dijk, up for a corner, flicked an Armstrong cross against the crossbar at the near post before a desperate blocking tackle by Maryhill defender Conrad Balatoni prevented an almost certain goal from Johansen's drive. Balatoni again came to Thistle rescue in the ninth minute, beating Guidetti to a header in front of an empty goal, after left-back Emilio Izaguirre had troubled Fox after surging into the penalty area. Moments later, Mackay-Steven was set up Johansen but his goalbound drive from 12 yards was deflected away by Thistle defender Callum Booth. Yet, in the 21st minute, in a rare attack, the visitors almost snatched the lead but Higginbotham's spectacular volley from 14 yards was saved by Craig Gordon - but only on the stretch. Commons' long-distance drive in the 28th minute just cleared the bar but a minute before the break he was more accurate from the spot, firing the penalty low into the corner giving the despairing Fox no chance. Leigh Griffiths spurns a glorious opportunity to put Celtic 3-0 ahead late in the match . The goal came as some relief to the home fans who had grown slightly irritated as the first half wore on. Two minutes after the break Commons forced Fox into a decent save with a powerful 25-yard drive and while the Maryhill defence cleared their lines from rebound it looked ominous. Thistle continued to defend stoutly and desperately in equal measures but were undone again when Johansen took a clever Guidetti pass before rolling the ball into the corner of the net from 10 yards. Two minutes after replacing Guidetti, Leigh Griffiths somehow turned a Mackay-Steven cross past the far post from two yards out but it was inconsequential. In the 79th minute, with the game drifting, Gordon made another good save, this time from Thistle substitute Gary Fraser, on for Stuart Bannigan.

Unemployment has continued to fall and a record 31 million people are in work, the last jobless figures before the general election have shown. The Prime Minister used the data to warn that the recovery would be 'put at risk' by a 'stitch-up' between Labour and the SNP, after Ed Miliband and Nicola Sturgeon clashed in a TV debate last night. The Office for National Statistics said\u00a0more than 31 million people were in work after an increase of more than half a million in the past year . David Cameron today warned the recovery would be put at risk by a Labour-SNP 'stitch-up' after the election on May 7 . The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that more than 31 million people were in work after an increase of more than half a million in the past year, the biggest total since records began in 1971. The figure is up from 29million in spring 2010, before the Tories and Lib Dems went into coalition. At the same time the jobless total fell by 76,000 to 1.84 million in the quarter to February, the lowest for almost seven years. Mr Cameron said: 'There are now 2 million more people in work than in 2010 \u2013 that's more families with the stability and security of a regular pay packet. 'This is thanks to the hard work and the determination of the British people, and the Conservatives' strong leadership and clear economic plan. 'It would all be put at risk with the chaos of a Miliband-SNP stitch-up, hiking borrowing, hurting the economy, and costing jobs \u2013 and it'll be hardworking taxpayers who'll pay.' He used a speech today to warn that a Labour government would put 1million jobs at risk. Claiming Mr Miliband represents a threat to jobs, the Tory leader said: 'You know what makes me really angry? It's when our opponents still go on about 'you Tories \u2013 the party for the few and not the many\u2026' Excuse me? 'This is the party that's taken three million of the lowest-paid workers out of income tax altogether; that's cut the taxes of 26million working people; that's seen 1,000 jobs created every day \u2013 jobs that are giving families security, putting food on tables, helping people out of poverty. 'Under the last five years of Labour, unemployment went up by 600 people a day. 'So if Ed Miliband repeated the economic mistakes of the last Labour government \u2013 that he was a part of \u2013 he risks a million more people joining the dole queues.' The UK's unemployment rate is now 5.6 per cent, a fall of 1.3 per cent since a year ago. The rate was 7.9 per cent in May 2010, when the last general election was held . In a live TV debate last night between opposition leaders, Ms Sturgeon warned Mr Miliband is not 'strong enough' to win the election alone and urged him to ditch austerity to kick the Tories out. The Labour leader rejected the offer of a post-election deal, telling Ms Sturgeon: ''It's a 'no', I'm afraid. 'You want to gamble on getting rid of a Tory government; I can guarantee that we get rid of a Tory government if you vote Labour.' But polls suggest the SNP is set to make huge gains in Scotland, depriving Labour of hopes of securing an overall majority.

Around 1.3 million people were in part-time jobs when they wanted full-time work, up by 29,000 in the latest quarter, while self-employment was little changed at 4.5 million. In a live TV debate last night between opposition leaders, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon warned Labour's Ed Miliband is not 'strong enough' to win the election alone and urged him to ditch austerity to kick the Tories out . The number of people classed as economically inactive, including those looking after a relative, on long-term sick leave or who have given up looking for work, fell by 104,000 to just under nine million. Average earnings increased by 1.7 per cent in the year to February, 0.2 per cent down on the previous month. Long-term unemployment has also fallen, down by 188,000 to 623,000 for those out of work for at least a year. Youth unemployment - 16 to 24-year-olds - fell by 22,000 in the three months to February to 742,000. The ONS also reported that 107,000 people were made redundant over the latest three months, little changed on the end of last year, but more than 200,000 fewer than the record peak of 311,000 in early 2009. There were 743,000 job vacancies across the country in January to March,\u00a0124,000 more than a year ago and the highest since records began in 2001. Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: 'Britain is the job creation powerhouse of the western economies. With record numbers of people in work and the highest employment rate ever, people can see the difference Lib Dems have made in government. 'The balance, common sense, fairness and financial discipline praised by the IMF today are the things we have brought to government.' Rachel Reeves, shadow work and pensions secretary, said: 'Today's fall in overall unemployment is welcome, but with working people earning on average GBP1,600 less a year since 2010 and the biggest fall in wages over a parliament since 1874, it's clear the Tory plan is failing. Dr John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist, said: 'The quarterly increase of 248,000 in the number of people in work in the UK is remarkably strong. With two-thirds of these additional people employed full-time and almost all employees in permanent jobs this surge indicates real momentum in the ongoing jobs recovery. 'Together with zero price inflation, the jobs boom is helping improve real incomes despite the fact that wage pressure remains subdued. However, the rise in employment and real wages continues to mask severe underlying weakness in labour productivity. This will have to improve markedly if the current recovery in living standards is to be sustained into the medium and long-term.'", "reference": "Employment surges as the number in work hits a record 31million .\nJobless total falls by 76,000 to 1.84 million, the lowest for seven years .\nCameron warns a Labour government would put 1million jobs at risk ."}, "317": {"id": "726bffa060aa3a92691d66b43ae54b36e0abebe0", "article": "Sleepless nights leading to the general election appear to have affected  David Cameron's memory after\u00a0Prime Minister made an embarrassing gaffe by forgetting which team he supports.

The Queen and senior members of the Royal Family will attend the Westminster Abbey service of thanksgiving - the culmination of three days of events marking the milestone. A chain of beacons will be lit across the country, Spitfire and Lancaster bomber planes will take to the skies and a star-studded concert will be held in London from May 8 to 10 as part of commemorations marking the 70th anniversary. The Queen will lead the nation at a religious service . On VE Day - May 8, 1945 - the Queen, then Princess Elizabeth, famously joined the jubilant victory celebrations in London and danced the conga through the Ritz Hotel before joining crowds outside Buckingham Palace. Jean Woodroffe, one of the Queen's first ladies in waiting, when interviewed by the BBC to mark the monarch's 80th birthday in 2006 said: 'What was amusing is that we went into the Ritz hotel through one door and out of the other door, the other end, doing the conga.' She added: 'And then we stood outside Buckingham Palace with the crowd and we all shouted 'We want the King' with everybody else until the King and Queen came out onto the balcony.' On the first day of the festivities a national two-minute silence will be held at The Cenotaph at 3pm on Friday, May 8, marking the moment prime minister Winston Churchill broadcast his historic speech to formally announce the end of the war. It will be followed by the lighting of more than 100 beacons, stretching from Newcastle to Cornwall. The next day cathedrals across the country will ring bells at 11am in celebration. In 1995, the Queen, the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace to mark the 50th anniversary of VE Day . VE Day 50th Anniversary, 1995, showing enthusiastic crowds at Buckingham Palace . Many veterans were alive to celebrate for the anniversary in 1995, some will still be for the 70th this year . Stars will also perform at a 1940s-themed concert held on Horse Guards Parade in London in the evening, to be shown on the BBC. At the Sunday service the Queen, Duke of Edinburgh, Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall will be joined by veterans and their families, politicians, members of the Armed Forces and representatives of Allied nations and Commonwealth countries that fought alongside Britain. A parade of bands, veterans and current servicemen and women will then make their way from the Abbey along Whitehall before a reception in St James's Park for 2,000 veterans hosted by the Royal British Legion. The parade will pass the balcony of the Treasury building, where Churchill made his historic speech before vast crowds on VE Day. That afternoon there will be a fly-past of current and historic aircraft from the RAF, including Hurricane, Spitfire and Lancaster bomber planes from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight. Vehicles dating from the 1940s will also be on display in St James's Park. People are encouraged to enjoy their own celebrations by holding street parties. Announcing the three-day celebrations last month, William Hague, First Secretary of State, said they would pay 'fitting tribute' to those who did so much to defend the country and ensure victory in Europe. Winston Churchill waves at the crowd in Whitehall during VE Day celebrations on 8 May, 1945 . A Cheer Goes Up For George VI, his wife - later Queen Mother - and the Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret as they appear on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, 70 years ago on 8 May, 1945 . He said: 'It is right that we take time to reflect on the sacrifices made, not just by those in the Armed Forces, but by civilians such as Land Girls and those in Reserved Occupations and make sure that the whole country has the chance to take part in commemorating this momentous anniversary and remembering those who gave so much for our freedom. 'The celebrations in London will be echoed by other events across the country to mark VE Day 70, with local authorities and communities encouraged to participate. 'They will celebrate with members of their communities who contributed to the war effort throughout the Second World War.' The announcement of the VE Day celebrations came after the Queen attended the traditional Royal Maundy Service in Sheffield yesterday. Joined by the Duke of Edinburgh, Her Majesty, dressed in a turquoise coat by Stewart Parvin and matching hat,\u00a0was there to present 'alms' to 89 women and 89 men, among them D-Day veteran, Denis Gratton. 'It was just quick. I'm not very good at hearing,' said Mr Gratton, 91, after the ceremony. 'She did say something but I'm not sure what it were.' Handing out alms: The Queen presents a lady with the two Maundy Purses at Sheffield Cathedral . Custom: Monarchs have been presenting Maundy Money since 1210 and King John . The Queen, who had arrived on the Royal Train, was driven to the cathedral where she got a warm welcome from the flag-waving crowd and was presented with a nosegay of spring flowers. Met at the church door by\u00a0Peter Bradley, the Dean of Sheffield, and the local Bishop, Steven Croft, Her Majesty spoke briefly to the clergymen before being whisked inside for the service. After the hour-long service, the Queen posed for pictures with the Yeoman of the Guard, who had lined the cathedral's aisles during the ceremony. The Royal party then left for a reception at Sheffield Town Hall as the recipients emerged into the sunshine, all pleased with their royal acknowledgement. Patricia Durkin, 72, said: 'It was brilliant, absolutely wonderful. When I got here the atmosphere was tremendous.' The Royal Maundy Service is one of the UK's oldest royal customs and sees the monarch distribute alms in the shape of two purses of specially minted coins. This year, the Red Purse contains a \u00a35 coin, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the death of Winston Churchill and a 50p coin commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain. Commemorative: The red and white bags contain commemorative coins, this year featuring Winston Churchill . Tradition: The Queen and Prince Philip were handed traditional nosegays made from spring flowers . Historically, this sum of \u00a35.50 in the Red Purse is made up of \u00a33 for clothing, \u00a31.50 in lieu of provisions and \u00a31 for the redemption of the Sovereign's gown. The White Purse contains uniquely minted Maundy Money, which, unlike coins in general circulation,   bear the portrait of the Queen produced by Mary Gillick at the start of her reign. Gillick, a sculptor, designed the portrait which appeared on the coins of the UK and some Commonwealth countries from 1953 until preparations for decimalisation began in 1968. The portrait of the Queen wearing a wreath on her head was considered to reflect the nation's optimism as it greeted a new monarch in the post-war years. The Royal Maundy is an ancient ceremony which has its origin in the commandment Christ gave after washing the feet of his disciples the day before Good Friday. Warm welcome: The Queen is greeted at Sheffield Cathedral ahead of the traditional Royal Maundy Service . Cheerful: The Duke of Edinburgh was on jolly form as he arrived for the service . In an echo of the Last Supper, mediaeval and Tudor monarchs also washed the feet of beggars during the service. Unlike the nosegay, which was originally introduced as a means of disguising the repellent smell, that custom failed to survive the 18th century. The first monarch to take part in a Maundy Thursday service was King John, of Magna Carta and Robin Hood fame, who distributed gifts of clothes and money to the poor in\u00a0Knaresborough in 1210. John was also the first to present the poor with silver coins and is recorded as having done so in Rochester in 1213. John's grandson Edward I, the king known to posterity as 'the Hammer of the Scots', was the first to confine the tradition to Maundy Thursday alone, which, until his reign, could be conducted on any day of the year. Long wait: Many of the well-wishers outside the Cathedral had waited there for hours . Modernising: The 800-year-old tradition used to involve washing beggars' feet - hence the nosegay . All smiles: The Queen, who has only missed the ceremony four times, was all smiles as she arrived . Smell: The scented nosegays were originally used to disguise the stench of unwashed people .", "reference": "Three days of celebration to  mark the  70th anniversary of VE Day on 8 May .\nHer Majesty will attend Westminster Abbey service of thanksgiving .\nIn 1995, Her Majesty was joined by Queen Mother and Princess Margaret .\nYesterday the Queen distributed alms at Royal Maundy service in Sheffield ."}, "321": {"id": "112d3494fcbbbe52e1ef733edd4eb0c86f80102c", "article": "Christian Benteke's hat-trick secured a vital point for Aston Villa in a thrilling game against relegation rivals QPR.

And while coffee matching rules are not as hard and fast as wine pairing ones, there are still some things you should consider. So the next time you order a latte and reach for a slice of cake, you might want to want to rethink your choice of dessert and have a Chelsea bun instead. The next time you order your coffee give some thought to your choice of pastry . The classic English pastry has been identified as the perfect accompaniment to a creamy latte, as well as a cinnamon swirl and a pain au raisin. And espressos are best paired with chocolate truffles or a mini raspberry coulis. Flat whites are best accompanied by a blueberry muffin, and a plain black coffee is best drunk with a glazed ring doughnut. Will Corby, from online coffee subscription company Pact Coffee, told FEMAIL: \u2018It is worth remembering that the coffee used to brew different types of coffee will all have different flavour profiles so the acidity/bitterness/sweetness balance of the coffee used is something to consider when pairing it with pudding. From lattes to espresso and Americano to cafe au lait, here are Will's picks for the best puddings and pastries to accompany your cup of java. A latte (left) which has a light espresso flavour is best complemented with a Chelsea bun (right) LATTE: Cinnamon swirl, Chelsea bun or pain au raisin . Something big and hearty has to go with the light texture and sweetness of a latte. Delicate spice and toasted pastry flavours should work best, allowing you to detect the light espresso flavour through the warm milk. ESPRESSO: Chocolate truffle or mini raspberry couli . Espresso is strong and short drink, your taste buds will be exposed to very intense tastes when you drink it and any accompaniment needs to either pack an equally intense punch or complement in an alternative and cleansing way. I would suggest the chocolate truffle be paired with a fruity espresso and the raspberry couli with a more chocolatey espresso. FLAT WHITE: Muffins . A light fluffy muffin (blueberry is my choice of sweet) should accompany your flat white really well but if you are prepared to take things a little further a ham and cheese sweet/savoury muffin works even better! IRISH COFFEE: Cheese and crackers . Definitely an end of meal, post-dessert drink this is best paired with cheese - perhaps a crumbly hard cheese like a Lancashire - \u00a0and sweet crackers but maybe avoid the chutney. Glazed ring doughnuts (left) will bring out the flavour profile of a plain black coffee (right) CAPPUCCINO: Amaretti . Amaretti for dipping, avoid any extra milk or other intense flavours when it comes to this drink. BLACK COFFEE: Doughnuts . Black coffee (brewed filter or with a V60 dripper) with tends to have a more delicate flavour profile than coffee brewed in other ways. Drink it with a glazed ring doughnut to make the most of the coffee flavours. AMERICANO: Baked New York cheesecake . A cheesecake and an Americano should sit together really nicely... you will generally end up with a much more developed bitterness in an Americano and the heavy fat and intense sweetness from this cheesecake should balance that perfectly. MOCHA: Marshmallows . Opt for good quality squidgy vanilla marshmallows as this drink already has all the flavour going on. It just needs the addition of a little extra sweetness and texture from the desert. Good quality marshmallows (left) will complement the strong flavours of a mocha (right) CAFE AU LAIT: Croissant . A French classic, this should really be accompanied by croissant and blackcurrant jam. CORTADO: Custard tart . An espresso cut with a small amount of milk, this coffee is Spanish or Portuguese in origin, so I would lean towards a Portuguese (custard) tart for this. MACCHIATO: Almond brittle . To go with this espresso topped with foamy milk, choose almond brittle, which has short, intense caramelised sweetness but tastes more like toffee than sugar. AFFOGATO: Best by itself . This coffee is the dessert, in which an espresso is poured over ice cream so it should require no addition! A post-dessert drink, Irish coffee (left) is best paired with a crumbly, hard cheese such as  Lancashire (right) Latte: Coffee made with espresso and steamed milk. Espresso: Strong coffee made by forcing steam through ground coffee beans. Flat white: An Australian invention this is prepared by pouring microfoam (steamed milk with fine bubbles) over a single or double espresso. Irish coffee: Coffee made with Irish whisky and sugar, and topped with cream. Cappucino - Smaller in volume than a latte, a cappucino has hot milk and steamed milk foam with one shot of expresso. Affogato: Vanilla ice-cream topped with a hot shot of espresso. Americano: Espresso diluted with hot water. Mocha: A chocolate flavoured latte with espresso and hot milk. Cafe au lait: A light brown coffee with milk. Macchiato: Espresso with a small amount of steamed, foamed milk. Cortado: A Spanish version of the macchiato made with espresso and a small amount of steamed milk.", "reference": "Head of Coffee at Pact Coffee\u00a0Will Corby recommends the best pairings .\nHave a crumbly, hard cheese like Lancashire with your Irish coffee .\nA delicately spiced pastry will let you detect light espresso flavour in latte ."}, "323": {"id": "57c22a85b60e82b8825c242a14afcdc31d19005f", "article": "QPR have confirmed that Eduardo Vargas has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a knee ligament injury that is expected to keep him out for between 10-12 weeks.

His words are sure to resonate with supporters who boycotted Sunday\u2019s 3-1 defeat at home to Spurs \u2013 a sixth straight loss which equals their worst-ever run in the Premier League. Before the game fans gathered outside the Gallowgate End and were united in choruses of \u2018We\u2019re rich but our team is s***\u2019 and \u2018Where\u2019s the money gone?\u2019 in protest at Ashley\u2019s running of the club, which this month returned record profits of \u00a318.7million and later revealed they have \u00a334m sat in the bank.

When you watched them over the years there was madness, there was excitement, stupid goals going in one end and then the other, but it was exciting. \u2018Now it\u2019s boring.

The Bruno Smartcan is said to be the first internet connected combined kitchen bin and vacuum cleaner. Using sensors on the front of the bin, it is able to sense when dust and debris from the kitchen floor is swept towards it with a brush, turning on a vacuum to suck up the offending mess. The Bruno Smartcan (pictured) uses sensors to detect when you want the lid to open or when dirt has been swept close so it can activate its integrated vacuum. It also has an integrated bag store and charging cord . Bruno comes with an integrated bag dispenser that additionally sends alerts to a smartphone when the owner is getting low on bags, and it can send reminders when it is time to take out the rubbish. Developed by inventors Jim Howard and Lori Montag, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, the bin is able to clean up dog hair and spilt breakfast cereal and crumbs, sucking it up directly into the bin bag. It is the perfect invention for the house proud - a substance that means clothes will never stain, glass will not mist and kitchen surfaces automatically shed their germs. Scientists  have developed a \u2018self-cleaning\u2019 coating that can be sprayed  onto materials. The substance, made out of coated titanium dioxide nanoparticles, works because it is very, very water resistant. Any moisture which touches it turns into a ball and rolls away, cleaning up dust in its path. The breakthrough, by chemists at University College London, comes after years of research into highly water-resistant - or \u2018superhydrophobic\u2019 - substances. It also features a motion sensitive hands-free lid that opens automatically. The inventors said: \u2018Bruno and its patents pending technologies have been many months in the making. \u2018The powerful vortex vacuum feature will deliver every dog hair, cheerio and grain of dirt directly into the trash bag. \u2018No more stopping, no more scooping, just place the broom in front of the vacuum inlet to start the suction and Bruno will do the rest. \u2018Bruno will also remind you to take the trash out on trash day, and alert you when you are low on Bruno Bags.\u2019 The pair is hoping to attract support for their invention on Kickstarter. They said the Bruno \u2018smartcan\u2019 can run for 30 days on its battery before needing to be recharged. Dust swept close to the base of the Bruno Smartcan activates the vacuum, which sucks it directly into the bin.\u00a0The vacuum  is powerful enough so suck up spilt breakfast cereal, dust and hair, while its integrated bag dispenser knows when you need to buy new bags . An extendable recharging cord is built into a flip up section just behind the main lid. Users can buy custom-fitted bags for the Bruno, which fit into its dispenser, or use standard bin bags.

Currently mobile phone companies charge customers up to 20p a minute to dial what are free numbers from a landline phone. The net result is that millions of people dialling what should be free services run by the NHS, the government and company call centres end up paying hefty charges. Scroll down for video . End call: Charges of up to 20p a minute being charged by operators for free 0800 numbers will end from July 1 under proposals published by the telecoms watchdog, Ofcom, today . Alternatively, some who rely on mobile phones rather than landlines are put off accessing these services by the cost. The charges will end from July 1 under proposals published by the telecoms watchdog, Ofcom, today. The changes were fought by the mobile phone networks, which have been making tens of millions of pounds a year from customers calling the numbers. In 2013, the biggest mobile network, EE, even threatened to take legal action to block the move. At the time, the company, which is about to be taken over by BT in a deal worth \u00a312.5billion, complained getting rid of charges for 0800 numbers was \u2018ill thought out\u2019 and would \u2018crush an already struggling industry segment\u2019. It argued the change could cost up to \u00a357.5 million to implement and that mobile networks would simply put up other charges to make up for any lost income. Ernest Doku, telecoms expert at the price comparison service, uSwitch.com, said the end to mobile charges to call 0800 numbers was a \u2018long-overdue victory for common-sense\u2019. EE claims the plan is ill thought out and will make an already struggling industry suffer . A spokesman for the telecoms price comparison website, broadbandchoices.co.uk, welcomed moves to make the price of calls clearer to consumers. He said: \u2018Making \u20180800\u2019 numbers free from all telephones including mobile phones is excellent news since it\u2019s rarely practical to redial from a landline to avoid charges for what are generally assumed to be \u2018free phone\u2019 numbers. \u2018Greater cost transparency and simplicity of charging is badly needed in the landline and mobile phone sector. We regularly hear from consumers who are confronted with charges on their phone bill that they were unaware of.\u2019 The changes are part of a wider shake-up in call charges to non-geographic numbers, which are described by Ofcom as the \u2018biggest overhaul of phone calls in more than a decade\u2019. They are part of a new regime imposing new rules covering the cost of calling the 084, 087 and 09 numbers used in TV show phone polls, by businesses, GP surgeries and government departments \u2013 as well as 118 directory enquiry numbers. At the moment, the cost of calling these numbers is mired in confusion with charges varying enormously depending on whether you are using a landline or a mobile phone. In future, organisations using these numbers will be required to advertise a single \u2018service charge\u2019 for dialling them. Separately, each phone company will apply an \u2018access charge\u2019 for putting people through. Consumers will add the two figures together to work out the full cost, which will vary depending on which phone company they are signed to. Ofcom and phone companies will be publicising the changes under the banner UK Calling before the switch in the summer. The regulator\u2019s chief executive, Sharon White, said: \u2018In July we\u2019ll see the biggest changes to phone calls in over a decade, affecting 175 million phone numbers. \u2018The changes are important for people who enjoy interacting with their favourite shows, but also for everyone calling companies and organisations on 08, 09 and 118 numbers. s.poulter@dailymail.co.uk .", "reference": "Operators are charging up to 20p a minute - even if 0800 numbers are free .\nSome are important services run by Government and NHS departments .\nWatchdog Ofcom published proposals to put an end to the rip-off in July ."}, "328": {"id": "bd4684a0f5af5dd6ac88d2fb50f902bd7f10217b", "article": "River Plate are keen to sign Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao but admit a deal is complicated.

Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said she was 'not afraid' of a legal challenge because she is convinced the Labour peer is not fit to plead because of his dementia. And in her first interview since she announced Lord Janner would not face trial she refused to quit because 'making the right decision is not a resigning issue'. Fighting back:\u00a0Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said she was 'not afraid' of a legal challenge over her decision not to charge Lord Janner and said she would not quit . Victims and leading politicians have accused her of 'damaging public confidence' in the justice system with her ruling \u2013 even though there was a enough evidence to go ahead with a prosecution. Mrs Saunders admitted herself that three investigations into claims made by 25 alleged victims over 25 years were botched \u00a0- but decided it was now too late to charge him. She told the\u00a0Evening Standard today: 'If somebody wants to challenge my decision I'm not afraid. The proper way to challenge it is through the right to review or a judicial review. 'I'm confident that if they want to do that my decision will stand up. I thought long and hard before making it and I'm confident I got it right. My job is not to be populist. 'The medical evidence was very clear. He wouldn't be fit to stand trial, he wouldn't understand the questions, he wouldn't understand the process, he wouldn't be able to understand instructions. 'It's not to make decisions on the basis of what people want. It's about making the right decisions. Sometimes that means it won't be popular but if I'm fulfilling my duties as DPP that's the right thing to do.' Police began investigating Lord Janner, pictured, after allegations of historic child-sex abuse were made but now he is too ill to be put on trial . Last night it emerged Mrs Saunders overruled the advice of two of the country's most senior barristers to allow Lord Janner to avoid a trial. Clare Montgomery QC and child abuse expert Eleanor Laws QC, leading counsel to the investigation, offered advice which could have supported a move to prosecute. In particular, Mrs Laws pointed to overwhelming evidence and corroborating accounts by victims during the two-year police inquiry. But Mrs Saunders decided it was not in the public interest to put Lord Janner in the dock due to his Alzheimer's disease. Campaigners, MPs and victims believe a 'trial of the facts' could have satisfied the need to get to the bottom of the appalling claims against the peer, whatever his mental state. And MailOnline revealed last week that 19 dementia sufferers have been prosecuted for child sex offences and ten were in the past year. The Mail revealed today that Lord Janner signed over the deeds of his \u00a32million home to his children at the height of the police paedophile case against him, it can be revealed. The move puts his luxury apartment potentially out of reach of child abuse victims suing the Labour peer for compensation. The flat, in an exclusive gated community near Hampstead Heath, North London, was transferred free of charge to his two daughters and son in March last year - the same month police raided Janner's Westminster office and three months after they had swooped on his home. In the four years after he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2009, the former Labour MP, 86, has claimed more than \u00a3100,000 in parliamentary expenses and allowances. Lord Janner signed over the deeds of his \u00a32 million flat in this complex to his children after the police raid . Even earlier this month, on April 9, he was fit enough to sign a letter saying he wanted to remain in the House of Lords. A week later, the Crown Prosecution Service announced Janner would not be tried over child sex allegations because he was suffering so much from Alzheimer's that he could not even understand any charges against him, let alone answer them. This was despite the fact the CPS ruled there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sexual offences against children dating from 1969 to 1988. Victims have accused bungling authorities of helping to cover up the crimes of a once powerful man and destroying any hope they had of justice. Child protection campaigners, MPs, police and victims have vowed to challenge the decision in the courts. Last night, two senior Government figures joined the chorus of disapproval and said concerns over the decision were justified. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there was something 'very strange' about the ruling and Health Minister Norman Lamb said the authorities should examine precedents of dementia sufferers being brought to trial. He added that the matter should be brought before a court because Mrs Saunders and the Crown Prosecution Service had made 'heinous errors by failing to bring a prosecution earlier when there was evidence there to do so'. Last seen: Channel 4 News filmed Lord Jenner outside his house in London on July\u00a08 2014, when he was last seen in public . Signed: Dementia sufferer Lord Janner signed a letter on April 9, just a week after he was deemed unfit to stand trial. His signature has been redacted for privacy reasons . Mr Hunt said London Mayor Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Theresa May had been 'right' to express concern at the decision, adding: 'I think we all think that there is something very, very strange here where someone was signing official letters only a matter of weeks ago and is somehow escaping prosecution for something so incredibly serious.' Lord Carlile, a Lib Dem peer and legal expert, said although there was strong evidence Lord Janner had dementia, the decision not to proceed with legal action should be reconsidered. This week, leading politicians from seven parties demanded the decision be reversed. The group, led by Labour's Simon Danczuk, wrote to The Times: 'As long as justice is not seen to be done and the greater public interest is not served, the public will see attempts to investigate establishment figures involved in historic child abuse as a whitewash.' A CPS spokesman confirmed Mrs Laws advised Mrs Saunders to prosecute and that Mrs Montgomery was consulted on an 'ancillary matter'.

Above, troops walk across the island in 1982 . Argentina has said it will prosecute oil companies operating off the Falklands coast, as tension rise on the 33rd anniversary of the conflict. Officials claim companies active there are acting 'illegally' in Argentine territory. It comes after Britain struck oil in the Falklands this week in a remote field of the islands. The find, announced by British firms that share the exploration area (Premier Oil, Rockhopper Exploration and Falkland Oil & Gas), could be worth billions of pounds and will increase fears of renewed conflict over the British overseas territory. It comes just days after Defence Secretary Michael Fallon warned of a 'very live threat' from Argentina. David Filmus, the Argentine minister in charge of the Malvinas, as the islands are known in Latin America, said: 'The new exploration efforts to try to find hydrocarbons in the area carry a huge environmental risk.' He said the foreign and planning ministries would undertake a joint legal filing in the coming days to try and block further exploration. 'We want the owners of the companies to be tried according to Argentine laws and international statutes,' Mr Filmus said, adding that the process 'could end with an Argentine judge issuing an arrest warrant against those who operate illegally in Argentine waters'. The discovery at the Zebedee exploratory well comes amid worsening relations with Buenos Aires, exactly 33 years after Argentina invaded the islands. Lord West of Spithead, a former First Sea Lord, said last night the find would lead to further claims by the Argentinians over the long-disputed territory in the South Atlantic. 'The rhetoric and sabre-rattling from Argentina will grow,' he added. 'The Argentinians have always been worried we will find oil and, given their economic state, they will think, 'We should have it'. 'We will have to be careful. The only way to stop them (acting) is to ensure we have sufficient military there. The rhetoric from Argentina will get worse.' Argentina invaded the Falklands in 1982, leading to a conflict that cost 260 British and 650 Argentine lives. The South American state still claims territorial rights to the islands. Britain pledged last week to invest \u00a3180million over the next ten years to defend the islands, with an upgrade of a surface-to-air missile system and the deployment of two Chinook helicopters. The commitment came after it was revealed earlier this year that Russia could be helping to re-arm Argentina. The latest incident sees a heightening of tensions between Argentina and Britain over the Falklands. Pictured is the bombing of the Sir Galahad Troop Carrier, after it was hit by a missile . A map shows the oil has been discovered 130 north of the island by British companies at the Zebedee oil well . Yesterday's discovery, which could yield 100 million barrels of oil, was announced by the British firms that share the exploration area, Premier Oil, Rockhopper Exploration and Falkland Oil & Gas. Malcolm Graham-Wood, an oil industry expert and founder of the consultancy HydroCarbon Capital, said: 'This is good for Britain, good for British oil companies, good for taxes and good for the industry.' Samuel Moody, chief executive of Rockhopper, which is named after the southern rockhopper penguins found on the islands, said: 'This is a fantastic start to the 2015 Falklands drilling campaign and provides early proof of the significant remaining potential of the North Falkland Basin.' Shares in the oil-exploration companies initially soared to double digits after the discovery was announced. The row over the sovereignty of the islands, which Argentina calls Malvinas, could be intensified by the oil find. However, Mr Graham-Wood said: 'Oil is always found in difficult places, geographically and politically \u2013 look at Alaska, for instance \u2013 but that has never worried the oil industry.' Oil expert Charlie Sharp, of the investment bank Canaccord Genuity, said the Zebedee discovery was 'an excellent start to the exploration campaign'.

Argentina has now written to the UN about British 'aggression' Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (right) pays tribute to the soldiers who died in the conflict during  the commemoration of the 33rd anniversary in Ushuaia last week . Kirchner\u00a0used the anniversary - commemorated in Argentina as the Day of the Veterans and Fallen of the Malvinas Islands War - to criticise Britain's announcement it will beef up its defence of the islands . Kirchner told the crowd: 'We will see the islands form part of our territory again. It's not just wishful thinking' Documents released by American whistleblower Edward Snowden allege Britain was actively spying on Argentina between 2006 and 2011. There has been no official response from Britain or Argentina to the claims, which were published by several Argentine news agencies. The documents include allegations Britain implanted computer viruses and circulated false propaganda to discredit the Argentine government, it has been reported. It follows another made nearby in 2012 through a project called Sea Lion, but the price of oil has halved since June, forcing many explorers to cut back on spending. Experts also predict future finds could be even more significant. Stephane Foucaud, oil analyst at First Energy, said the latest discovery is 'encouraging news', but another well \u2013 called Isobel Deep, 15 miles to the south \u2013 is the 'most important' in the area. Mr Fallon said last week that existing defences in the Falklands would be modernised, with investment in 'ageing infrastructure' and an upgrade of the surface-to-air missile system.

The details of where and how the West-Sussex born model and mistress of Rossetti died remained a mystery for years until her biographer recently tracked her down through hospital records. They revealed the orange-haired beauty - whose face graced many of her lover's paintings - died in the Sussex county asylum in poverty and suffering from clear symptoms of dementia. Rossetti's famous painting Aurelia 'Fazio's Mistress' (pictured) was a portrait of his muse Fanny Cornforth . Fair Rosamund, painted in 1861 (left), and 1886's Lady Lilith (right) also used Cornforth as the model . The records revealed she died at the Graylingwell Hospital on February 24, 1909, at the age of 74. At the time of her death, she was suffering from 'senile mania, confusion, weak-mindedness and an inability to sustain a rational conversation, a poor memory and sleeplessness', The Guardian reported. Born Sarah Cox in 1835, she met Rossetti in 1958 and was considered one of his 'stunners' - a reference to the women he kept in his company as lovers and models. She went on to pose for at least 60 of his artworks. Art historian Kirsty Stonell Walker used the records from Graylingwell Hospital in Chichester, now stored at the West Sussex records office, to track down her  resting site and lay flowers at her unmarked grave. Ms Stonell Walker told The Guardian: 'It is a very sad story, but the hospital was not a terrible place, it actually had a very progressive approach towards mental illness. 'She was buried with a few other people, but not exactly in a pauper's grave.' Rossetti was the son of Italian scholar Gabriele Pasquale Giuseppe Rossetti and his wife Frances Polidori. He was born in London in 1828 and is known for his painting, illustrating, translating and poetry. He founded the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in 1848 with contemporaries William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais. His most famous paintings include Beata Beatrix, The Girlhood of Mary Virgin, How They Met Themselves. Dante Gabriel Rossetti was one of the most well-known founding members of the Pre-Raphelites group . The Pre-Raphelites were a group of English artists who formed a 'brotherhood' in 1848, dedicated to creating work that rejected the mannered approach adopted by Raphael and other Renaissance painters. Believing Raphael, Michelangelo and Leonardo had proven a corrupting influence on art, they wanted to return to the intense colour and detailed compositions that characterised 15th century Italian art. Founded by William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, the trio later welcomed Rossetti's brother, William, James Collinson, Frederic George Stephens and Thomas Woolner to their circle.", "reference": "Details of the death of Dante Gabriel Rossetti's muse finally unmasked .\nBiographer\u00a0Kirsty Stonell Walker located her grave using medical records .\nThey revealed she died penniless, suffering from dementia in an asylum .\nShe was the muse and model for some of Rossetti's best-known works ."}, "333": {"id": "a9234eebb285fc352b14de7628115b231b8bb484", "article": "A neo-Nazi charged with killing a gay supervisor at a community college said he did so because he hates homosexuality.

He was asked if he hates gays. 'Yes, I do, with a passion,' he replied, though he said that was only one of the reasons he killed Lane, who had been his supervisor in a work study program at the college before he was fired for absenteeism. Stancil also told the television station he had killed three other people, including two in the Wayne County area.

His mother,\u00a0Debbie Stancil, said her son was angry over being dismissed from his work-study job for excessive absenteeism. She also said Lane made sexually laced comments to her son.

When that happens I make sure I express my own displeasure. \u2018We\u2019re a very fast-growing party, we\u2019re increasing our attraction \u2013 it clearly is daft for us to see a political context where we\u2019re not maximising our support in every potential group. \u2018And, as set out today, there is no reason why we should be lagging with female voters \u2013 we still are, we\u2019ve got to work harder on addressing those issues and we are doing.\u2019 The event was delayed after the Ukip-branded backdrop collapsed minutes before the press conference was due to begin, sparking frantic work to rebuild the set. The party used the event to confirm a raft of policies, including removing VAT from sanitary products, which they have dubbed a \u2018tampon tax\u2019. It also said it would give \u2018absolute, full and unconditional\u2019 support for current maternity and paternity leave laws, as well as making sure maternity wards are \u2018properly resourced\u2019. Ms James said the party would tackle the problem of female genital mutilation (FGM), which she warned is \u2018accepted cultural practice\u2019 for some of \u2018our ethnic compatriots\u2019. Mrs Evans, who is writing the party\u2019s election manifesto, blamed the gap in support for Ukip between men and women on \u2018lies\u2019 and \u2018myths\u2019 spread about the party. She said: \u2018I think it is because of the lies the other parties have put out about us. \u2018There is this myth we will scrap maternity leave, that we hate women, that we don't do anything for women - I think Diane and I are living proof. \u2018Unfortunately the propaganda the other parties put about has hit very hard and very deep.\u2019 Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom was forced out of the party in September 2013 after branding women who do not clean behind the fridge as \u2018sluts\u2019. Mr Farage, who was absent from the women\u2019s event, has previously been criticised for controversial remarks about breast-feeding and whether women are less valuable to employers after they have been on maternity leave. In a 2010 interview, the party leader who has often been photographed smoking cigarettes and drinking pints of beer, also boasted: \u2018I\u2019ve got so many women pregnant over the years.\u2019", "reference": "Diane James described her admiration for Putin during radio debate .\nParty's justice spokesman Russian President\u00a0is a 'very strong leader'\nComments came as campaign chief says party members are 'chauvinistic'"}, "335": {"id": "756ad2e764420e1d22ca9801ea4d36eef9fa0bec", "article": "A Canadian man found a novel way to take in the sights while travelling across country, by taking an rocking chair with him.

When Cook reached 17 of his unbeaten 37 he went past Alec Stewart to become the second highest run-scorer in England's Test history and now only his mentor in Graham Gooch stands ahead of him. 'He's been an amazing performer for eight or nine years now,' said Broad. 'And he's such a level headed character that you never know whether he's got nought or 200 if you bumped into him in the evening. 'Cooky won't be thinking about personal landmarks now. He knows if he gets a big hundred tomorrow he will set his team up with a fantastic chance of getting a result and it was great to see Cook and Trott back together again.\u00a0Hopefully they can score a lot more runs tomorrow.' Broad revealed that a chat with new bowling coach Ottis Gibson and a change of technique led him to add 10 miles per hour to his bowling overnight and look back to his best. Cook plays a shot to the legside as he found some form on a rain-interrupted day two at St George's . Broad celebrates the wicket of West indies captain Denesh Ramdin, who was caught behind on 31 . 'I made a slight change overnight after watching quite a lot of footage of how I got my wickets and I was a bit wider on the crease which allowed my momentum to go straight through,' said Broad, who touched 91 miles per hour when bowling a beauty to take Denesh Ramdin's wicket. 'It seemed to work and I was really pleased with how I bowled today.'

The system would use a telescope already mounted on the station to find and target pieces of debris up to 62 miles (100km) away. Powerful pulses from the laser would then push space junk into Earth\u2019s atmosphere, where it would burn up. Tokyo researchers have proposed a laser system to attach to the ISS. It would be used to shoot down pieces of debris in Earth orbit (artist's illustration shown). The system would have a range of 62 miles (100km) and could target things less than 0.4 inches (1cm) in size . The paper, by researchers at the Riken research institute in Tokyo, was published in Acta Astronautica. Their system would use the Extreme Universe Space Observatory\u2019s (EUSO) super-wide-field telescope on Japan\u2019s Kibo Experiment Module on the ISS. The laser, meanwhile, use bundles of optical fibres to produce powerful laser pulses - capable of both high power and high frequency, although exact figures were not given. Since the first object, Sputnik 1, was launched into space 53 years ago, mankind has created a swarm of hundreds of thousands of items of debris. The rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets, abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel. There are around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and countless more smaller ones that could do damage to human-carrying spaceships and valuable satellites. One major source of debris in the past was a Chinese anti-satellite missile test in 2007 that left an estimated 150,000 pieces of junk in the atmosphere. Accidental events have also contributed to the problem. In 2009 for instance there was a major crash between a U.S. communications satellite and a defunct Russian military probe over Siberia. Combining these two instruments would create a system that could deorbit space debris down to the size of 0.4 inches (one centimetre). The impact of the laser beam on debris would create a force that reduced its velocity, causing it to fall into Earth\u2019s atmosphere and burn up. The group plans to deploy a small proof-of-concept experiment on the ISS, with a small, eight-inch (20-centimetre) version of the EUSO telescope and a laser with 100 fibres. \u2018If that goes well, we plan to install a full-scale version on the ISS, incorporating a three-meter [10ft] telescope and a laser with 10,000 fibres, giving it the ability to deorbit debris with a range of approximately 100 kilometers [62 miles],\u2019 said lead researcher Dr Toshikazu Ebisuzaki. Looking further into the future, the team said they could have a \u2018free-flyer\u2019 mission not attached to ISS in another orbit to shoot down debris. For example, such a system could be deployed in polar orbit at an altitude of about 500 miles (800km), \u2018where the greatest concentration of debris is found,\u2019 according to Dr Ebisuzaki. Without going into specifics, the team says their proposal could remove \u2018most\u2019 of the centimetre-sized debris in Earth orbit within five years of operation. MailOnline has asked the researchers to explain how often the laser would fire, and what its maximum capacity in terms of debris-size to deorbit would be. The technology bears some similarities to the Death Star - shown - used to devastating effect in the original Star Wars trilogy.\u00a0Without going into specifics, the team says their proposal could remove \u2018most\u2019 of the centimetre-sized debris in Earth orbit within five years of operation .

But the researchers realised they could put it to another use - the removal of space debris. The fibre-powered laser, meanwhile, was originally developed to power particle accelerators - but again another use for it was found. Space debris, which is continuously accumulating as a result of human space activities, consists of artificial objects orbiting the earth. The number of objects nearly doubled from 2000 to 2014 and they have become a major obstacle to space development. The total mass of space debris is calculated to be about 3,000 tons. It consists of derelict satellites, rocket bodies and parts, and small fragments produced by collisions between debris. \u2018We may finally have a way to stop the headache of rapidly growing space debris that endangers space activities,\u2019 added Dr Ebisuzaki.", "reference": "Tokyo researchers have proposed a laser system to attach to the ISS .\nIt would be used to shoot down pieces of debris in Earth orbit .\nWould have a range of 100km and could target things less than 1cm in size .\nThe team says their proposal could remove 'most' of the debris in orbit ."}, "339": {"id": "b836595c859f7175b1e485978327be5652623e7f", "article": "Juventus have made a move for Paulo Dybala, the Palermo striker who has caught the eye of Manchester United and Arsenal, according to reports in Italy.

Raghunandan Yandamuri, 29, who had served as his own lawyer before being convicted of murder, accused the attorneys of not responding to his calls or letters. He said Monday in Montgomery County Court if his appeal keeps going the same way he would rather be executed immediately. Raghunandan Yandamuri, 29 (left), of King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, is appealing his death penalty sentence for a murder but says that he would rather be executed than continue with his lawyers. Above, Nov 2012 . Yandamuri was convicted in the grisly stabbing death of Satayrathi Venna, 61 (left) and the suffocation death of her grandchild Saanvi, 10 months (right) Judge Steven O'Neill called that 'a little dramatic.' Attorney Henry Hilles said he and colleague Stephen Heckman have spent more time with their client 'than has ever occurred in Montgomery County history.' 'Mr. Heckman and I met with Mr. Yandamuri at the prison tens and tens and tens of times at his request over the two plus years that we were representing him. It boggles my mind to hear him claim that we have not made ourselves available to him,' Hilles told the\u00a0Times Herald. Yandamuri was a technology professional outside of Philadelphia and knew the baby's parents in what prosecutors called a botched kidnapping plot. The Indian national was given two death sentences in the 2012 slayings of 10-month-old Saanvi Venna and 61-year-old Satayrathi Venna. He was expressionless as the verdict against him, which included up to 62 years in prison for kidnapping, burglary, and abuse of a corpse, was read in October. Prosecutors argued Yandamuri hatched the kidnapping plot to pay for a gambling habit. They said he was mired in gambling debts and told police he committed the crime after losing at least $15,000 at a casino. He told investigators he panicked after the grandmother, who had opened her family's apartment door to him, was killed in a struggle over a kitchen knife he had carried. Yandamuri, an Indian national working as a technology professional outside of Philadelphia, acted as his own lawyer during his trial before his post-conviction hearings were taken over by lawyers . Yandamuri told police he accidentally dropped the baby, put a handkerchief over her mouth to quiet her and tied a towel around her head. He said he then left the baby \u2014 with her dark hair, huge dark eyes and white dress \u2014 in a trash-strewn, unused sauna in a basement fitness center and when he returned hours later with milk for her she was unconscious. Prosecutors said that the man kept the baby in a suitcase in the trunk of his car for days and slashed the elder Venna's throat to the bone. Yandamuri knew the baby's parents, who also were young Indian tech professionals, from his King of Prussia apartment complex. The defendant had gone to a birthday party for the baby's mother, had met the visiting grandmother and used family nicknames in a ransom note demanding $50,000, authorities said. 'They both are working, so I thought maybe they have some money,' Yandamuri told police in a videotaped statement. 'My intention was not to kill anyone or not to harm anyone. I only tried to kidnap the baby.' At trial, though, Yandamuri argued two other men forced him at gunpoint to help and said he was pressured into confessing. 'Mr. Heckman and I met with Mr. Yandamuri at the prison tens and tens and tens of times at his request over the two plus years that we were representing him,' attorney Henry Hilles (pictured) said . He also said during a post conviction sentencing hearing that he would rather receive the death penalty than sit through the hearings where relatives spoke about the victims, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. His mother Padmavathi traveled from India took the stand and said that her son had been traumatized since age ten after his father was killed in a terrorist attack. She said that he had previously tried to kill himself by drinking kerosene. Yandamuri has tried to file motions on his own since the beginning of his appeal, but they cannot be accepted because he is not representing himself. Hilles and Heckman plan on challenging the death penalty as well as alleged bias during Yandamuri's trial. All death penalty cases in Pennsylvania are given automatic appeal up to the state supreme court level. Earlier this year Democratic Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf declared a moratorium on the death penalty, citing bias in proceedings, expense and inefficiency in repeated appeals. The state has not executed anyone since 1999.", "reference": "Raghunandan Yandamuri, 29, sentenced to two death sentences last year .\nMontgomery County, Pennsylvania man acted as his own lawyer during trial .\nKiller knew victims, 10-month-old Saanvi and 61-year-old Satayrathi Venna .\nAppellant accused the attorneys of not responding to his calls or letters .\nHe asked for death during sentencing and had previously tried to kill himself ."}, "345": {"id": "e5424d1cedb3721d92ed0e475ebc22758da65d46", "article": "One of two teenagers feared to have crossed into Syria to join ISIS is believed to be a relative of Hammaad Munshi (pictured), who became Britain's youngest convicted terrorist when he was found guilty of terror offences at the age of 18 in 2008 . A relative of Britain's youngest convicted terrorist is believed to be among two  teenagers who have fled into Syria to join Isis. The pair from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, have not been in contact with their families for several days and cannot be reached on their mobile phones. One of the boys is believed to be a relation of Hammaad Munshi, who was just 15 when he joined a cell of Islamic fanatics targeting the Royal Family. The grandson of a British sharia judge, Munshi was recruited by a leading 'cyber terrorist' who radicalised impressionable Muslims and encouraged them to attend military camps in Pakistan. He was arrested on his way home from a chemistry exam in 2006 and found with two bags of ball-bearings - key material for a suicide vest. He was locked up for two years under the\u00a0Terrorism Act in 2008. The Times\u00a0reported that the two 17-year-old boys told relatives that they were going on a school trip, but instead used the Easter holidays as a 'window of opportunity' to flee Britain. They are thought to have boarded a Thomas Cook flight from Manchester Airport to Dalaman in Turkey on March 31, said West Yorkshire Police. Both families have reported the boys missing to police although British authorities now fear that the pair have managed to cross into Syria from Turkey. A family friend said they were in a state 'of total disbelief' and they were 'broken and inconsolable'. The south Dewsbury area has been linked to a number of extremist plots and was home to the ring-leader of the London bombings on July 7, 2005, Mohammad Sidique Khan. According to The Times, a member of one of the families said: 'We don't want to talk.' Assistant Chief Constable Mark Milsom, from West Yorkshire Police said: 'We are extremely concerned for the safety of these two boys and would urge anyone with information to come forward and speak to us. 'Syria is an extremely dangerous place and the public will be aware of the dangers these boys may face. 'The choice of returning home from Syria is often taken away from those that come under the control of Islamic State, leaving their families in the UK devastated and with very few options to secure their safe return.' The force said it has been supporting the missing teenagers\u2019 families and carrying out extensive inquiries alongside the North East Counter Terrorism Unit. The disappearance of the two teenagers follows the arrest of nine Britons by Turkish authorities attempting to sneak into Syria across the Turkish border. Waheed Ahmed, 21, from Rochdale was arrested with his aunt, cousins and four children while attempting to get into Syria. Scroll down for video .

After the arrest, anti-terror police raided the home of his father, Shakil Ahmed, a respected Labour councillor for the town. Munshi's family comes from Dewsbury in West Yorkshire, where his grandfather Yakub Munshi ran the town's sharia court. The schoolboy, who was studying for his GCSEs at Westborough High School in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, was traced through his online conversations with 'cyber terrorist' Aabid Hussain Khan. In one MSN chat, they argued how best to sneak a metal sword through airport security. Munshi had painstakingly scoured the internet for details on how to make napalm and grenades. He claimed he had only done the research out of curiosity but handwritten notes hidden under his bed revealed his burning desire to travel abroad to become a martyr. The boys are from the same town as London 7/7 suicide bomber Mohammed Siddique Khan (pictured) Munshi also had a library of videos, documents and audio clips showing acts of jihad, mujaheddin fighters and Al Qaeda preachings. He was arrested as he walked home from school after an exam. Khan, who acted as an administrator on an extremist website called Activion Publications, downloaded information on the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles and Camilla, Prince Edward, the Countess of Wessex, The Duke of York and the Princess Royal. Munshi was convicted of making a record of information likely to be useful in terrorism.

Poultry producers and scientists had been hoping warmer weather would knock down the deadly bird flu virus. But the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday that the H5N2 bird flu virus had been found at a farm in northwest Iowa's Osceola County - prompting a massive bird cull. Bird flu: Chickens stand in their cages at a farm near Stuart, Iowa. Discovery of the bird flu on an Iowa turkey farm has raised serious concerns that the bird killer could find its way into chicken barns in the nation's top egg-producing state and rapidly decimate the flocks that provide the U.S. with its breakfast staple . The confirmation means up to 5.3 million hens there must be destroyed in a state that produces one in every five eggs consumed in the country. Seven other Midwestern states have also been hit by the virus, dooming nearly 7.8 million turkeys and chickens since March. The virulent strain in question is the H5N2, a highly contagious virus that kills commercial poultry quickly once it gets into a barn. Yet the risk to the public is considered low and infected birds are being kept out of the food supply. So far, only two egg operations have been hit \u2014 the one in Iowa and one in Wisconsin. Except for a couple of backyard flocks, all the other cases in the Midwest have been at commercial turkey farms. Minnesota has had 28 turkey farms hit, far more than any other state. Turkey farm: In this photo provided by Bethany Hahn is a flock of turkeys at a Minnesota poultry farm. The country's poultry industry may have to live with a deadly bird flu strain for several years according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture . Precautions: Most commercial poultry barns are shut tight to keep the diseases out, and poultry farms with good biosecurity strictly limit who is allowed in - but is does not always protect poultry from bird flu . Officials say that's because Minnesota is the top turkey-producing state, and its thousands of lakes and ponds are attractive to migrating ducks and other waterfowl. H5N2 and other highly pathogenic strains have also been found since late last year among wild birds, backyard flocks and commercial farms in some western states and British Columbia. U.S. Department of Agriculture officials say the virus could be a problem for several years. The USDA's chief veterinary officer, Dr. John Clifford, said last week that while new cases should drop close to zero once the weather warms up and kills off the virus there's 'very likely' to be a resurgence this fall when the wild waterfowl that are natural carriers of avian influenza fly south for the winter. An outbreak that kills tens of thousands of birds certainly can cost a farm dearly. The government doesn't compensate producers for birds that die of the disease itself, but it does reimburse them for birds that have to be euthanized as a precaution. That gives farmers an incentive to report suspected outbreaks and deal with them swiftly. Outbreaks do not always drive up the cost of turkey eggs and chicken as the toll nationwide represents just a small part of U.S. production. Hormel Foods Corp., which owns Jennie-O, said Monday that it will sell less turkey this year because of the outbreaks. Turkey prices around the holidays often have nothing to do with the costs of production. Retailers often sell turkeys at a loss just to draw in customers who'll stock up on stuffing mix, cranberries, sweet potatoes, pies and other traditional favorites. However, several precautions have been put in place at farms to control the outbreak and stop the spread of bird flu. Most commercial poultry barns are shut tight to keep the diseases out, and poultry farms with good biosecurity strictly limit who is allowed in. Other precautions  include workers often having to shower on their way in and out, wear protective coveralls and step in disinfectant to kill viruses on their boots. Equipment coming in and out is typically sanitized. But despite these measures, the system doesn't always work. According to experts, the only way it can work is if everyone does everything right all of the time - which can prove difficult. And if rodents and wild birds sneak into a barn it can bring the virus that way. Farms tend to be extremely diligent at handling  bird flu as turkeys die quickly and know how to spit the early warning signs. Less severe symptoms can be similar to colds and flu in humans, or a flock turning quiet. While vaccines have been used around the world to protect flocks against various bird flu strains ahead of time, this strain is new to North America. Once an infection is confirmed at a farm, all surviving birds on the property are typically killed to prevent it from spreading. These flocks are usually killed by pumping a water-based foam into the barn, following guidelines from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The foam suffocates the birds within minutes. If birds die they usually cover them in compost in the same barn where they died. Composting is a widely used and approved method throughout the industry to dispose of dead birds. It's thought to be an effective method as the heat generated by composting is enough to kill flu viruses and other pathogens commonly present in poultry such as salmonella. The compost is then used as fertilizer.", "reference": "The deadly H5N2 bird flu virus has been found at a farm in northwest Iowa .\nUp to 5.3 million hens must be destroyed in the state to contain outbreak .\nSeven other Midwestern states have also been hit by the deadly virus .\nMinnesota, the top turkey-producing state has been\u00a0severally\u00a0effected .\nNearly 7.8 million turkeys and chickens have died or been culled since March ."}, "347": {"id": "64bd379f2ca37ea9d2dce9fb60b70bbef729f501", "article": "Bangkok (CNN)Thailand has lifted martial law, replacing it with it a controversial new security order granting sweeping powers to the ruling military junta. Critics have expressed alarm at the move, with Human Rights Watch's Asia director Brad Adams saying it marked the country's \"deepening descent into dictatorship.\" Martial law was lifted Wednesday when the Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej approved a request from Prime Minister General Prayuth Chan-ocha to proceed. Prayuth -- head of the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) junta -- immediately invoked Article 44 of the country's interim constitution \"to curb acts deemed harmful to national peace and stability.\" Article 44 states, in wide-ranging terms, that when the head of the junta believes it is necessary in the name of public harmony or to prevent the undermining of national security, then he has the power to act as deemed necessary. According to a statement issued by the NCPO, the new order grants military personnel powers to issue summons and arrest those who commit crimes against the royal family or against national stability, who commit crimes involving war weaponry, or who violate the orders of the NCPO. Designated military personnel were granted powers to seize assets, to block media from reporting or publishing, and to detain suspects up to seven days, the statement said. Unauthorized political gatherings of more than five people were banned, while those who defied NCPO orders could be imprisoned for up to a year, it said. Those who were detained could not leave the country without the approval of the head of the NCPO. Human Rights Watch said in a statement that the new security order would allow Prayuth \"to issue orders without administrative, legislative, or judicial oversight or accountability.\" \"Thailand's friends abroad should not be fooled by this obvious sleight of hand by the junta leader to replace martial law with a constitutional provision that effectively provides unlimited and unaccountable powers,\" Adams said in a statement. Sunai Phasuk, Human Rights Watch's senior researcher on Thailand, told CNN the move would see Prayuth \"become a strongman with ultimate power in his hands to wield as he wishes.\" \"This is a dangerous indication that the junta is not going to keep its promise to restore democracy and respect for human rights in Thailand,\" he said. Rupert Abbott, deputy director for Asia Pacific at Amnesty International, called in a statement for the NCPO to \"reinstate the rule of law and constitutional protections for human rights which the 2014 coup steamrolled over.\" Meanwhile, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein expressed alarm at the news. \"Normally I would warmly welcome the lifting of martial law -- and indeed strongly advocated for it to be lifted in Thailand,\" the High Commissioner said. \"But I am alarmed at the decision to replace martial law with something even more draconian, which bestows unlimited powers on the current Prime Minister without any judicial oversight at all. This clearly leaves the door wide open to serious violations of fundamental human rights.\" Martial law was imposed shortly before Thailand's military seized power last May, ousting the democratically-elected government of Yingluck Shinawatra after months of sometimes violent street protests. Since then, the NCPO has curbed civil liberties, muzzled the media and rounded up opponents. Amnesty International says that since May, hundreds of people have been arbitrarily held and dozens brought before military courts for engaging in peaceful political gatherings or expression. Thai political scholar and coup opponent Pavin Chachavalpongpun told CNN that the move from martial law to the new security order amounted to \"pouring the same wine into a new bottle.\" \"The junta is trying to reinvent itself, but the substance is still there,\" he said. \"In a word: it's absurd. Everyone knows in Thailand they had to abolish the martial law because of international pressure. \"But Article 44 is a lot worse than the martial law because it gives total power to the NCPO.\" Thailand's military rulers have insisted that such restrictive measures are needed to maintain stability, following a decade of political conflict which has pitted a royalist, middle-class Bangkok elite against Shinawatra's supporters, mostly drawn from the urban working class or the rural north. But Pavin did not believe there was a sufficient threat to national security to justify the new order. \"The notion of national security has been exploited over and over,\" he said. A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok said it was important that Thai citizens were allowed \"to freely exercise their fundamental rights, including the rights of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.\"", "reference": "Martial law has been lifted in Thailand after 10 months .\nIt has been replaced by a new order granting sweeping powers to the military junta .\nCritics warn the move deepens the country's \"descent into dictatorship\""}, "348": {"id": "ef0f52070101ad3415bea8665f4a1a6f3c636fac", "article": "Eating out just once a week raises your risk of suffering from high blood pressure.

Professor Tazeen Jafar, of Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School Singapore (Duke-NUS), designed and supervised a study to find behaviour associated with hypertension in a young adult population in South East Asia. Her team surveyed 501 university students, aged 18 to 40, in Singapore. Figures on blood pressure, body mass index (BMI) and lifestyle, including meals eaten away from home and physical activity levels, were collected. The association with hypertension was then determined. Researchers in Singapore found those who frequently dine out or feast on takeaways are more likely to have pre-hypertension. Stock photo . Using statistical analysis, the researchers found that pre-hypertension was found in 27.4 per cent of the total population, and 38 per cent ate more than 12 meals away from home per week; while the gender breakdown showed that pre-hypertension was much more prevalent in men (49 per cent) than in women (nine per cent). The findings showed those who had pre-hypertension or hypertension were more likely to eat more meals away from home per week, have a higher mean BMI, have lower mean physical activity levels, and be current smokers. The novel finding of the study, published online by the American Journal of Hypertension, was the link that Dr. Jafar's team was able to show between pre-hypertension and hypertension with meals eaten away from home. The researchers said that what was also significant was that even eating one extra meal out, raised the odds of pre-hypertension by six per cent. Dr Jafar said: 'While there have been studies conducted in the United States and Japan to find behaviours associated with hypertension, very few have surveyed a South East Asian population.

The truth is that a dark, cold night at Preston North End in mid-February is more significant. United were poor that night in the FA Cup at Deepdale, coming from behind to win. That, however, was the night Wayne Rooney was restored to a centre-forward position, the night Louis van Gaal finally began to realise the best place from which his best player and captain should lead was from the front. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney has been returned to his preferred position up front . The 29-year-old had previously been deployed in midfield this season and United had struggled . Now, manager Louis van Gaal (left) looks set to unleash an in-form Rooney on Manchester City on Sunday . United actually lost their next game at Swansea but have subsequently won their next five in the league, with Rooney scoring four times. Incredibly, given the pattern of this season, they head into Sunday's derby game with Manchester City as slight favourites. Prior to that night in Lancashire, Rooney was on the verge of knocking on his manager's door to ask for an explanation about his deployment in the centre of midfield. It seemed as though Van Gaal was about to experience his first very real problem at Old Trafford. Whether he sniffed something in the air, we will never know. But Van Gaal performed a sharp volte face at just the right time and Rooney has gone on to become the most significant figure in United's return to relevance. At Old Trafford, just as he has since Cristiano Ronaldo left for Real Madrid almost six years ago, Rooney represents the most serious threat to City's prospects. Prior to the win over Tottenham, Rooney stood before his team-mates in Manchester's Lowry Hotel and delivered an impassioned call to arms. He is once more the central figure at his club, in more ways than one. 'I think some people mix up scoring goals with form,' said Van Gaal yesterday. 'For us Wayne is very important as a player, as a captain and because he can score goals. But he can do that from midfield, too. The last goal he scored \u2014 against Aston Villa \u2014 came when he was playing in midfield.' Van Gaal's mid-season deployment of Rooney in midfield remains a sensitive subject. No coach likes to admit he may have been wrong. All that matters now, though, is the 29-year-old's current trajectory, which is undoubtedly upwards. His name is written right through recent derby history of course. He is the fixture's record goalscorer and the scorer of one of its most spectacular goals, that remarkable overhead kick back in 2011 that some City supporters, rather oddly, still maintain came off his shin. Previously there had been the transfer saga of autumn 2010. Courted heavily by City as he prevaricated over a new United contract, Rooney most definitely had his head turned. To this day, rumours persist of meetings in an underground car park at the Etihad Stadium \u2014 that one has always seemed a little fanciful \u2014 and promises of a salary in excess of \u00a3300,000 per week. Rooney scores his side's second goal during United's 3-1 Premier League victory over Aston Villa . What we do know is that there was a point when City and their manager Roberto Mancini thought the transfer was about to happen. So, too, did many United fans. 'Join City and You're Dead' warned graffiti on a city-centre poster carrying his image at the time. Had it done so then these fixtures would probably never have been the same again. As it is, derby day now finds Rooney even more fired up and motivated than ever. City have won the last four and one only has to scroll through the tapes to watch the England centre forward's body language, especially during last season's 4-1 reverse at the Etihad, to see exactly how that has gone down. Rooney may be a Liverpudlian but he understands the City rivalry better than most at his club. In Stretford, Rooney has the opportunity to ease United clear of Manuel Pellegrini's team. When asked yesterday if he has a leader of the United captain's ilk in his squad the City manager was less than convincing.

'There's not a conspiracy theory or anything like that,' he insisted. 'It was just an absolute shocker. I just can't work out what he was thinking. 'It was just idiotic how he didn't see it. It wasn't a conspiracy, I just can't remember a decision that bad from someone standing so close. 'There is no way he could have thought that ball hit the player on the head, he must be an idiot not to see it. It's just ridiculous.' A goal ahead at the time, Celtic reacted to 'supporter pressure' by writing to the SFA seeking clarification on the failure of referee Steven McLean to award a penalty and send Meekings off. Sutton infamously triggered a huge row in 2003 when he accused Dunfermline of 'lying down' to Rangers to pip Celtic to the title on the final day. Insisting Sunday was a question of incompetence rather than integrity, however, he added: 'It's not a conspiracy, it's just a rubbish and inept decision. 'It shouldn't happen and it doesn't reflect well on the Scottish game if decisions like that are made. 'I don't know if maybe he (Muir) panicked, but he has a job to do and if he is not up to the job \u2014 which he clearly wasn't \u2014 then he shouldn't do it again.

Karen Davis, from Port Pirie in South Australia, was captured\u00a0streaking by a camera car for the popular Google Maps app, which allows users to zoom in on certain streets and towns in cities all over the world with a 360-degree view. Police released a statement alleging the 38-year-old mother 'pursued' the Google car to make sure she was captured exposing herself, and that it was an illegal act. Karen Davis (pictured) from Port Pirie has caused controversy after a picture appeared on Google Maps Street View showing her bearing her size-K breasts . 'The woman\u2019s actions were the same as someone flashing their genitals and the public expectation is that we take action,' said\u00a0Superintendent Scott Denny of Port Pirie police. 'Recently in Port Pirie we arrested a man for exposing himself in public - this incident is no different,' he said. 'It is not appropriate for anyone to expose themselves in public places. Our community should be able to expect a bit of decency.' Ms Davis will be summonsed to appear in the Port Pirie Magistrates Court at a date to be determined.

Ms Davis had issues with her size-K breasts in her 20's and is finally ready to embrace them and she plans to skydive topless for her 40th birthday . The mother says she is happy the picture appeared online and thought it was funny . Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Ms Davis was in tears over the nasty comments coming from her community after she was branded a 'bad mother' and 'pure filth' for her raunchy behaviour. 'They are narrow-minded people who are not happy with their own bodies,' she said. Posting on her Facebook account, Ms Davis addressed the fact that she pursued the car through Barry Street in Port Pirie until they got the perfect shot and believes locals are jealous of her antics. 'Haters hate, you got the guts to do it?' she posted on Facebook after the photo went public. 'All the flat-tittie chicks think I am disgusting. Big-boob envy has hit Port Pirie.' Taking to Facebook, disgusted commenters attacked Ms Davis' parenting skills after it became clear that her two sons were in the background of the picture. Ms Davis criticised 'flat-tittie chicks' and claimed they needed to focus on their own bodies . 'I'm sure your children will be proud of their mother that is probably going to cause them a lot of embarrassment,' one Facebook commenter said. 'Oh goodness. Can't even begin to imagine how her children are feeling,' another user said. However a select few came out in support of Ms Davis's show on Google Maps. 'Let her go, she's having some fun, Pirie people need to lighten up a bit. if more lovely ladies would get them out more often the world would be a much happier place,' one commenter said. Ms Davis told Daily Mail Australia that she thought the act would be funny and that it was an item she has now ticked off her bucket list. She also said that she has a friend in the United Kingdom and she thought it would brighten up his day if he saw the image online. 'I have a friend in the UK. If he looks on there he will smile,' she said. Ms Davis wasn't sure that the photo would make it on to Google Maps but she said she is delighted that it did. 'I think maybe some need to start their own bucket list and leave mine alone,' she said. While Ms Davis enjoyed herself bearing her breasts on the street, her neighbour sat on her lounger watching from next door . She also revealed that since the photo has been released she has attracted a whole host of new friend requests on Facebook. Many young men have tried to befriend her but she has not accepted any of them. Ms Davis said she has only learnt to embrace her size-K breasts in the last few years after spending her youth hiding them away. 'I \u00a0always got picked on and it wasn't until late in my 20's that I became confident in myself,' she said. She also revealed that she has to buy her bras online from the UK as they do not make size-K bras in Australia. 'It would be nice if they made my size bra in Australia,' she said. Ms Davis said that she would do it all again, even considering the backlash the image has received. 'It's my life not theirs,' she said. 'When you point your finger at me, you have 4 pointing back at yourself.'

The must-have for IVF mums and dads these days, however, is a video and pictures right from the moment of conception. The images are thanks to revolutionary technology that allows medics to record the microscopic miracle of life \u2013 from fertilisation to the division of cells, right through to the growth of an embryo. Hundreds of parents are now the proud owners of these EmbryoScope images, which are also helping scientists learn more about the IVF process. Scroll down for video . Pictured is the very first cell division of Pixie Morley, now aged nine months, taken using the revolutionary EmbryoScope technology . Sally and Stephen Morley (pictured with their daughter Pixie) are one of some 1,500 couples in Britain who have had babies using EmbryoScope technology . Sally and Stephen Morley are among them. The grainy grey and white picture on this page shows the first cell division in the creation of their IVF baby, Pixie. A tiny camera, placed inside an incubator, films the reproduction process. As well as allowing parents to watch back the moment the embryos form, the technology \u2013 developed in the US \u2013 also allows experts to select the best possible embryos based on how they form during the conception process. This narrows a mother\u2019s chance of miscarrying. The Morleys, from Walsall, had spent months trying to have children naturally before opting for IVF. Mrs Morley, 38, the head of a nursery, said: \u2018I knew time was against me being 36 when we started trying so when I failed to get pregnant each month I knew we should have fertility tests as soon as possible.\u2019 While the couple were undergoing IVF, the EmbryoScope technology was introduced at the Midland Fertility Clinic, allowing them to be the first in their area to capture their child\u2019s conception on camera. The technology allows medics and parents to watch the cell dividing. Pictured is the cell division of now nine-month-old Pixie . In October 2013, the embryo was transferred into Mrs Morley\u2019s womb and within two weeks she was told by doctors that the process had been successful. Now, nine months after Pixie\u2019s birth, she is still able to re-watch the moment her daughter was conceived. Experts have hailed the technology as one of the most important developments in IVF. Professor Simon Fishel, who is boss of Care Fertility, the first clinic in Britain to use the EmbryoScope, said: \u2018We now know that embryos that do make babies and embryos that don\u2019t make babies do different things. 'And to be able to see this in a time-matched movie and to be able to analyse it scientifically is absolutely wonderful science for us.\u2019 Professor Fishel, who was part of the team that produced first test-tube baby, Louise Brown, in 1978, said the EmbryoScope was revealing the secrets about what happens to embryos as they develop \u2013 and why it is that around 70 per cent of them do not actually make babies. The videos were also an emotional milestone in the process of becoming a parent, Professor Fishel said. \u2018The couple can see the process of fertilisation, see the cells divide, see the number of cells grow and see them produce an embryo\u2026it is nothing short of observing the wonderful miracle of life.\u2019 The video given to parents is a sped-up version of the process which occurs before the embryo develops. Professor Fishel said his patients were \u2018awestruck\u2019 when given the footage but that the clinic only gave parents the video once a mother had fallen pregnant. He added that, at across the Care Fertility clinics, 1,000 couples, who had gone on to have a baby, had been given footage of their embryo\u2019s development.", "reference": "New technology allows parents of IVF children to view babies' conception .\nIt allows parents to see the embryo forming far before usual 12 week scan .\nMedics are able to watch process and select best embryo to be planted .\nSally and Stephen Morley among 1,500 couples in UK to use technology ."}, "357": {"id": "7f808b45956302148857c9fa6fee937d0828b431", "article": "This is the moment a young orphaned chimp was rescued after she was found in a tiny wooden box cowering from the animal traffickers who killed her mother.

Scroll down for video . This orphaned chimp was found cowering in a tiny box terrified of the animal traffickers who killed her mother . The traffickers were caught during a joint operation by the Guinea Ministry of Environment, the Gendarmerie and the Guin\u00e9e-Application de la Loi Faunique (GALF) project. Charlotte Houpline, director of French wildlife protection group WARA, said\u00a0many traffickers have already been arrested and sentenced in Guinea sine they launched the project. She said: 'Slowly the change that is needed is happening. We have been supporting the Government of Guinea for four years now to strengthen law enforcement. Facilitating the arrest and conviction of wildlife traffickers is the main part of our work. 'And we want to target mainly the major traffickers to tackle head-on its major obstacle - corruption.' She added that Guinea, as well as all the other African countries home to great apes, have a low rate of prosecution for animal trafficking. The traffickers, who kept the three-year-old alive with food (pictured) had been trying to find a buyer for her . A spokeswoman for Eco Activists for Governance and Law Enforcement, said: 'The three-year old female who was saved last Saturday was the lucky one. 'She could very easily have ended in the house of some wealthy foreigner or even in an official zoo, travelling out of the country with false documents. 'But even more probably she might not even survive, as the estimations are that for one young ape, smuggled out of Africa, 10 others die on the way, as the traffickers are not able to provide them with proper care. 'Other horrific numbers are unknown - the babies, which are detected and in best case seized, like this our one, present only a minority of all poached and sold ape babies. 'By easy calculation, we can estimate the number of chimpanzees lost only in Guinea during last years to reach tens of thousands. The illegal animal traders had kept the terrified three-year-old chimpanzee in the box for two weeks . 'And hundreds of thousands in the all sub-Saharan Africa. This crime will drive the chimpanzees in wild to the extinction within few decades, if it is not stopped. 'Little apes are like human children. To survive, they need not only food, they need love and care. Trauma, which they experience when they see their mother and their family being killed, is not easy to forget. 'When their family is attacked and mother killed, they cannot do anything else than cling to her. And then they are torn away from mother\u00b4s still warm body by the same men who killed her, falling easily into depression and deprivation. 'Yet the future of this particular female looks brighter. She was not seriously injured nor fatally traumatised. Immediately after rescue she was accepted by a sanctuary that takes care of orphaned chimpanzees who survived the slaughter of their families. 'There she has a second chance, starting with a long process of rehabilitation to overcome the traumas they suffered and hoping to one day be back to the wild.' Chimpanzees are the closest genetic living relatives to humans - and their young take years to mature. They were stopped at a check point trying to cross into Sierra Leone from Guinea, in West Africa, last week . The country is a hub of wildlife trafficking internationally where apes, ivory, skins, reptiles, parrots, shark fins and manatees are illegally exported by organised crime syndicates. Since 2007, more than 130 chimpanzees and 10 gorillas were exported from Guinea to China with valid CITES permits, which classified these animals as having been bred in captivity - despite no captive breeding programmes existing in Guinea. According to UN Great Apes Survival Partnership (GRASP) the poachers have to kill approximately 10 chimpanzees to get one baby. So for 130 chimps, exported out of the country, 1,300 of their family members were slaughtered.. One year ago GALF, the Guinea Conakry branch of WARA provided information which lead to the arrest of one of the most notorious ape traffickers in Guinea, Ousmane Diallo. He was sentenced to a year in prison in July 2013 following an 18 month meticulous investigation by GALF.

A passenger who hijacked a plane's tannoy system while drunk to sing karaoke and then caused an airport to be evacuated could be handed a jail term. Graham Leonard, who was returning to Scotland after attending a Manchester United football match, grabbed the PA microphone on the private charter flight and burst into song for his fellow football fans after drinking beer and gin on match day. And after frustrating the cabin crew with his antics during the flight - including throwing a hot towel at one - he then caused part of an airport to be evacuated after deliberately setting off the fire alarm on arrival in Aberdeen. Sheriff Edward Savage said he was keeping 'all options open' and Mr Kelly to find out what impact a jail sentence would have on his client. 'I'm not entirely satisfied given the very serious nature of these matters that a financial penalty will reflect how serious these matters are,' said Mr Savage. 'I want to make it absolutely clear that I'm keeping all options open.' Leonard, 46, appeared at Aberdeen Sheriff Court yesterday where he admitted endangering the aircraft and its passengers as well as setting off the airport alarm knowing there was no blaze. The court heard that Leonard, from Newmacher, in Aberdeenshire, had been part of a group of Scots fans that had chartered an Eastern Airways flight to jet down to watch United's 3-0 league win over Tottenham on March 15 this year. They had been drinking beer and gin and tonics before leaving Aberdeen Airport, then spent the day meeting former players at a corporate event in a hotel in Manchester. Fiscal depute Karen Dow said that Leonard was one of three passengers that missed their ride back to the airport after the drunken day out. When he did eventually board the 9:17pm private flight from Manchester he started causing trouble for the cabin crew. Leonard was flying on a priavet charter Eastern Airways flight into Aberdeen Airport (file photo) Ms Dow said: 'During the journey the accused approached the complainer to ask if he could sing a song on the public address system. 'She said no and that was not permitted. The accused went to the PA mic and started singing. 'The complainer approached him and told him to stop and asked him to return to his seat. 'His behaviour persisted. This was frustrating for the complainer as it was part of the communication system used by the captain.' The court heard that the businessman, who owns a painting and decorating firm in Aberdeen, also repeatedly refused to sit down before throwing a hot hand towel at one of the stewardesses. Graham Leonard was returning to Scotland after watching Manchester United at Old Trafford, pictured . On arrival at Aberdeen International Airport he was seen 'talking' into the airport's PA system then activating a fire alarm. Around 40 people had to be evacuated from the area and two units from Scottish Fire and Rescue Service were called out to the false alarm. Defence agent Gregor Kelly said his client was 'mortified' about his conduct but asked the sheriff to consider a financial penalty. He said: 'In the sober light of day he is extremely apologetic. The full extent of what he had done did not become clear until the next day when he spoke to others. After landing at Aberdeen Airport, Leonard set the fire alarm off causing an evacuation . 'He is ordinarily a responsible business man. 'He is a regular on this charter plane which goes down to follow the fortunes of Manchester United. 'They had drank a mixture of beer and gin and tonic before embarking on the flight down. There was a special corporate event at hotel in Manchester with ex-players. 'He got carried away. There is no excuse for his behaviour.' Sentence was deferred for reports. Leonard was ordained to appear next month. Speaking after the case called, he said: 'I'm deeply sorry about what happened.

The four-bedroom property in central London's Farm Street has all the trappings of modern luxury with an indoor swimming pool, gym, lift, cinema room and roof terrace. One hundred and fifty years ago however it was used to house cows for milking on one of London's busiest trading streets.\u00a0Originally used as a milking parlour, it  became a depot before being knocked down in the 19th Century. In 2011 developers took over the site and demolished the house to make way for the plush mansion which now sits in its place. At 8,139 square ft, it is on the market for \u00a325million. A newly-built mansion that was constructed on the site of a former milking parlour in Mayfair has gone on the market for \u00a325million . The house is decorated throughout with modern furnishings and plush carpets. Among its features is a private lift and guest cloakroom . A grand piano sits in the marbled hall on one of the floor's houses. A 14-piece dining table is also featured in the luxury dining room . An indoor swimming pool now takes the place of what once would have been a milking shed in the 18th and 19th Century . A cinema room is one of the many modern features in the property. It was built in 2011 after developers knocked down the original structure . Impressive artwork throughout the house adorns its walls. It is being sold for \u00a325million by estate agents Wetherell and Knight Frank . An opulent 14-place dining table is found on the first floor of the luxury property which also has its own lift . London's milking parlours date back to Tudor times, with Farm Street serving as hub of agricultural trade for years. Cows were brought there from the grazing areas of Peckham, Holland Park and Hampstead heath and sold to local butchers. Alongside the parlours was an abattoir and pub, the Punch Bowl, which remains. Guy Ritchie and Madonna bought the pub while they were married and it quickly became a celebrity favourite.\u00a0Mr Ritchie sold it in 2013 to the Alexander Langlands Pearse. Inside the modern mansion are four bedrooms including a master suite which occupies the entire second floor. The lower ground floors feature a swimming pool complex with mosaic-lined pool, steam room, gym, shower and changing facilities, kitchenette, guest cloakroom and media room. It also has a private lift, marble flooring, a sweeping spiral staircase and a dining room which can seat 14. Speaking of the property,\u00a0Peter Wetherell, chief executive of Wetherell, said: 'This recently built house is an outstanding example of contemporary living in historic Mayfair at its very best. 'As the location of Mayfair\u2019s dairy, the interesting and unusual history allowed for the construction of a house on a commercial depot site, without the usual restrictions of historic listing controls. 'The result is an open flowing family house providing spacious rooms and generous ceiling heights rarely found in historic Mayfair.' The house has four bedrooms which all come with their own en suite bathrooms and is set over four floors. It was built in 2011 . One of the four bedrooms in the house is finished with sleek white, grey and black furniture and soft furnishings throughout . Another of the guest rooms in the luxury mansion furnished in cream and peach. The house has been described by estate agents as a 'flowing family house' One of the double bathrooms in the house has a deep marble bath, his and her's sinks and a large, walk-in shower .

Researchers behind the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index say the number of uninsured Americans is now at a record low. When tracking began in 2008 roughly 14per cent of citizens were uninsured, peaking at 18per cent in the third quarter of 2013. But marking a shift in the trend, for the first three months of this year the rate dropped to 11.9per cent. Whether the new findings turn out to be a high-water mark for President Barack Obama's health care law, or a milestone on the path toward his goal of getting virtually all U.S. residents covered, remains to be seen. Underlining a change across the nation, nearly nine in ten adults now say they have health insurance, according to an extensive survey released Monday . The law's future is still up in the air, and will turn on factors ranging from an upcoming Supreme Court decision on consumer subsidies to actions by Republican leaders in states opposed to Medicaid expansion. The latest update from the Gallup-Healthways survey\u00a0overlaps with the period when the health law's second sign-up season was winding down. Coverage gains from 2014-2015 translate to about 3.6 million fewer adults uninsured since the fall, before open enrollment got under way, according to Gallup. 'The Affordable Care Act had three major objectives: increase coverage, slow the rate of increase in costs, and improve health,' said Dan Witters, research director for the poll. 'The first one is clearly a win. Coverage is increasing; there is no question about it.' On balance, an estimated 14.75 million adults have gained coverage since the fall of 2013, when the law's first open enrollment season was about to begin, according to Gallup. The uninsured rate lowest since Gallup and Healthways began tracking in 2008 . 'A big outstanding question is what will happen over the next couple of years,' said Larry Levitt, a health insurance expert with the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. 'To meet expectations, enrollment has to continue to grow and push the number of uninsured down.' The Gallup-Healthways survey is closely followed because it combines the depth of government-sponsored research with the timeliness of media polls. Pollsters interview 500 people a day, nearly every day of the year. One of the questions they ask is whether people have health insurance. The health care law offers subsidized private insurance for people who don't have access to job-based coverage, combined with an expansion of Medicaid aimed at low-income adults in states that accept it. Big states like Florida and Texas are among those refusing to expand Medicaid. The law requires nearly all Americans to have coverage, either through an employer, a government program, or by purchasing their own plan. Those remaining uninsured risk fines. It also provides subsidies to help low-to moderate-income people buy their own insurance. Comparing the most recent sign-up period with the first open enrollment season, the survey found that the uninsured rate declined at a slightly slower pace this time around. In the first three months of this year, the uninsured rate fell by one percentage point. Over the same period last year there was a 1.5 percentage-point decline. From government officials to local volunteers, many people involved with the health care law expected some kind of second-year slowdown. Open enrollment season was shorter, and those who had remained uninsured were seen as more skeptical about the value of coverage. The survey also found that Hispanics saw the biggest coverage gains of any ethnic or racial group. The uninsured rate dropped 8.3 points among Latinos since the end of 2013. Even so, Hispanics are still more likely to be uninsured. 'At a time when Republicans are very keenly trying to court the Hispanic vote, a large chunk of Hispanics are gaining insurance via the Affordable Care Act,' Witters said. President Barack Obama's health care law requires nearly all Americans to have coverage, either through an employer, a government program, or by purchasing their own plan - those remaining uninsured risk fines . The most notable improvement has been among those making less than $36,000 a year, a group that traditionally struggled to get and keep health insurance . Recent gains in coverage have benefited people up and down the income ladder. But the most notable improvement has been among those making less than $36,000 a year, a group that traditionally struggled to get and keep health insurance. Their uninsured rate dropped 8.7 points since the end of 2013. Although the economic recovery is likely to be contributing to coverage gains, the uninsured rate is now significantly lower than it was in early 2008, before the recession. That suggests that the gains in coverage are due to more than an improving economy. Five years after its passage, the biggest question now for Obama's health care law is a Supreme Court challenge. Opponents of the law argue that its literal language only allows the government to subsidize premiums in states that set up their own online insurance markets. Most have not done so, defaulting to the federal HealthCare.gov. Supporters say that while some provisions may be confusing when read in isolation, the intent of Congress was to help consumers in every state pay their premiums. A decision in that case is expected by late June. The survey results were based on landline and cellphone interviews conducted from January 2 to March 31 with a random sample of 43,575 adults ages 18 and older. For results based on the total sample, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point.", "reference": "Researchers behind the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index say the number of uninsured Americans is now at a record low .\nWhen tracking began in 2008 roughly 14 percent of citizens were uninsured, peaking at 18 percent in the third quarter of 2013 .\nBut marking a shift in the trend, for the first three months of this year the rate dropped to 11.9 percent .\nThe survey results were based on phone interviews conducted from January 2 to March 31 with a sample of 43,575 adults ages 18 and older ."}, "361": {"id": "8911c07945c382306d5aba8cf6c513c0c8ce61d0", "article": "(CNN)Four workers died in a massive oil rig fire that raged for hours off the coast of Mexico Wednesday.

A hospital nursing assistant stuffed a wet wipe into a 96-year-old woman's mouth to stop her screaming. Deborah Roberts, 53, forced the tissue into Phyllis Hadlow's mouth in an attempt to silence her in front of other nursing staff at Kent and Canterbury Hospital. She also poured water over the dementia patient, telling other staff: 'My son said if they do it to you, you can do it to them.' A court heard how Roberts, 53, mistreated Mrs Hadlow when the elderly widow was being treated at the hospital. Roberts was\u00a0found guilty of one count of ill-treatment or wilful neglect of a person without capacity following a two-day trial - but avoided a prison sentence. Mrs Hadlow, who has since died, needed extensive medical care and would occasionally lash out and shout,\u00a0Canterbury Magistrates' Court was told. Staff nurse Janet Nelson said she heard screaming coming from her bed and went to investigate, only to see Roberts shove the wet wipe into the elderly woman's mouth. Roberts told her she did it to stop the patient screaming and Mrs Nelson  told her: 'I don't want to see this again.' In a separate incident, Mrs Hadlow threw water at Roberts so she retaliated by filling a plastic cup with water and pouring some on her head. Healthcare assistant Lisa Ross said Roberts told her: 'I have had enough of this. My son said if they do it to you, you can do it to them.' Roger Davies, defending, said Roberts had wrecked a lifelong career and was now unemployable as a nursing assistant. Roberts, who worked at Kent & Canterbury Hospital, also poured water over the elderly widow, telling other staff: 'My son said if they do it to you, you can do it to them.' He said: 'She didn't think about the consequences of her actions. She will be reminded every week of what she has done and the price she has paid.' Roberts, from Deal, Kent was suspended after the incident in October 2013 and then sacked. Julie Pearce, chief nurse and director of quality for East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'We are very sorry for the care Mrs Hadlow received whilst in our hospital and for the distress this would have caused to herself and her family.

The I'm UP Alarm can be set to go off the night before (left) and will then only turn off by scanning a QR code (pictured right) on a mug or magnet that can be kept in another room, forcing you to get out of bed to do so . Michael Smagon, the New York-based inventor of the I'm Up Alarm, said: 'We all hit the snooze, toss and turn, and fall back asleep. Then we do the morning dash because we lose those coveted morning minutes. 'I\u2019m Up is a mobile app alarm clock that is linked to a QR code that may be anywhere in your home, not in arms reach form bed, and the alarm does not go off until your scan the code, hence getting out of bed.' Smartphone users will be able to download the app onto their phone from June. Each device is paired with a specific QR code that can be printed out and stuck somewhere else in the house. The app developers also say they will be able to print the code onto mugs or magnetic buttons so they can be left in the kitchen to scan while you make your morning coffee. The alarm is set to go off at a certain time the night before and will make a noise until the QR code is scanned. The app uses a Quick Response code, or QR code, which is a form of barcode that the cameras of mobile phones are able to detect. Under Mr Smagon's concept, a code matched specifically to your app can be printed on your favourite mug or a fridge magnet. When the alarm goes off at the designated time, the only way to then get it to stop making a noise is to get out of bed and scan the code. For those who really need an extra couple of minutes, Mr Smagon says the app does have a snooze function, but only for a set number of occasions. He is currently seeking funding on the crowd-funding site Kickstarter to help him test the device. The app is due to be released in June\u00a0June and and will come as a free version with adverts or an ad-free version which will cost less than $8, or \u00a35.48. The alarm app will have a snooze function but it will only allow users to delay getting up a set number of times . Mugs and magnetic business cards and buttons with the codes printed on them can also be purchased and shipped worldwide or a free code can be printed from the company's website. I'm Up will be available on Apple and Android phones and a version for Windows phones is being developed. Mr Smagon said: 'In the evening you set your alarm for 6am and you have the best intention to wake up at this time, but in the morning everything looks different. 'Every excuse you come up with just to stay those five extra minutes in bed wins. We all know that those five minute snoozes quickly add up and all of a sudden we are late again. 'I'm Up alarm was invented to help people who are not one of those early birds to start the day.' The QR code can be printed onto coffee cups so users can turn off the alarm while making their morning drink .", "reference": "I'm Up Alarm is designed to help those who have trouble getting out of bed .\nAlarm will sound at a preset time and continue until a QR code is scanned .\nApp is expected to be available on Apple and Android phones from June ."}, "368": {"id": "bee40903cf13f6565f982c903b2c5b43051ad298", "article": "When most of us get caught in the rain, it's not a pretty sight.

The 26-year-old South African bombshell oozes old Hollywood glamour in the series of shots, which see her don a platinum blonde wig, a crimson pout and a dramatic cat-eye flick. Max Factor, which celebrates its 80th anniversary this year, is the brand widely accredited for transforming Monroe from a mousy brunette to a knockout blonde back in 1935, and delivering her with the iconic look showcased by Candice today.

Mike Heatlie, 42, launched the violent attack on Fiona McCartney outside a nightclub in Edinburgh because she did not give him a cigarette. Heatlie, from Edinburgh, was once voted as one of the city's most eligible bachelors and claims to have helped train Stefani before her 2009 U.S tour.\u00a0At the time, she described him as 'Superman'. Personal trainer Mike Heatlie, 42, (left), who claims to have previously work with Gwen Stefani, launched the violent attack on Fiona McCartney, 43, (right) outside a nightclub in Edinburgh . But Ms McCartney is now facing a \u00a37,000 dental bill and says she is too frightened to leave her home after being assaulted by the personal trainer. He pleaded guilty at Edinburgh Sheriff Court in March to the attack. He is due to appear again on April 22 for sentencing. Speaking for the first time about the attack, Ms McCartney, a legal PA from Greenbank in Edinburgh, said: 'I used to love going out on Saturday nights. But since the attack I have been very wary and like to be home by a certain time. 'I don't like to go out to nightclubs now and I get very panicky in crowds after this unprovoked attack. 'I'm on sleeping tablets from a doctor because I don't sleep at all. I still have this constant reminder and feel I can't move on because I still have the injuries from that night. I'm reminded every day of this attack.' Ms McCartney said the incident unfolded after Heatlie approached her while she was with a friend outside The Jam House club in March last year. The Edinburgh-based trainer apparently worked on and off with the No Doubt singer (pictured) since 1997 . A testimony which claims to be from Stefani appears on Heatlie's website, which describes him as 'completely passionate' and a 'wonderful motivator' He asked the pair for a cigarette but neither woman had one to give him. He then lashed out and punched her, she said. Ms McCartney said she still suffers from numbness and aching in her mouth. She is also due to have expensive and painful dental work, over the next few months. Heatlie (pictured above) pleaded guilty at Edinburgh Sheriff Court to the attack . Speaking about the incident, Heatlie said: 'This was an unfortunate incident that occurred last year. 'I have been in touch with Ms McCartney and the situation is now very amicable and both parties, I'm sure, would like to move on from it.' In a text message, which Ms McCartney said had been sent by Heatlie to her partner, the trainer wrote: 'Please pass on my sincerest apologies to your partner Fiona, I wanted to get in touch but obviously couldn't with the case proceedings. 'This incident, that I have virtually no memory of, has turned my life upside down and I can't imagine how it has impacted Fiona's. 'I am so sorry, this is completely out of character for me, I've never been involved in a violent incident in my adult life.' Heatlie used an endorsement from Stefani to help promote his new studio when it opened six years ago. At the time, she described Heatlie as being 'completely passionate about health and fitness'.

Dr Terry Dubrow and Dr Paul Nassif, the resident experts on the popular E! series\u00a0Botched,\u00a0which is due to begin its second season tonight, spoke to\u00a0Cosmopolitan.com\u00a0about the 'jaw-dropping' cases they were faced with while filming the upcoming season of the show, explaining that many of the various cosmetic blunders featured go beyond anything either of them had ever been faced with before. 'These cases are not found in any textbook,' Dr Dubrow said. 'You can't call any surgeon and say, \"Have you ever seen this?\" because no one has ever seen this.' Scroll down for video . Dynamic duo: Dr Paul Nassif (L) and\u00a0Dr Terry Dubrow (R) are back to taking on plastic surgery gone wrong on the second season of the E! reality show Botched, which premieres tonight . Regrettable decision: One of their clients this season,\u00a0Rajee Rajindra Narinesingh (pictured), had her face injected with 'cement' at an underground cosmetic filler party . He added that, not only are these seemingly unrepairable surgeries shocking, but they are made even more astonishing by the fact that he and Dr Nassif 'have to do something' to help these patients \u2013 even it seems at times as though nothing can help to repair the damage that has been done. During the interview, the duo, who have seen their fair share of cosmetic disasters, also stressed that cosmetic procedures are 'as serious as brain surgery' - which is one of the reasons why there are so many terrible outcomes. Dr Dubrow, who said that he and Dr Nassif were 'floored' by 60per cent of the surgeries they had to fix this season, noted that the show's producers had to give them time to figure out what they were going to do before they proceeded with a client's surgery so that they could come up with an effective means of fixing the often horrifying mistakes made by other plastic surgeons. He explained that he started this season by putting the cases in the photo section of his cell phone and every morning he would wake up, look at them and ask himself: 'How can I make this possible?' He referred to this season as a 'David and Goliath' story because the problems they came across were so impossible to face. Barbie world: Justin Jedlica, who is known as Human Ken, stops by the office to meet with Dr Dubrow . One of their patients this season, Rajee Rajindra Narinesingh, received black market injections from a self-proclaimed \u2018physician\u2019 who had her face filled with cement at a 'pumping party'. Dr Nassif said that Rajee, who is transgender, underwent the controversial \u2013 and incredibly dangerous \u2013 procedure 'an underground party where people get injections of black market product'. The unknown 'fillers' can be anything from non-medical grade silicone to food products to even caulking used for the bathtub, and Dr Nassif noted that people performing these risky procedures are not professionals - they are rarely even physicians. And the results are often disastrous. 'Once you have something put in your body, you're screwed,' she said. 'I obviously don't want to use that word, \"You're screwed,\" but you're permanently ruined.' Reality star: Jordan James Parke (pictured) has spent more than $100,000 on plastic surgery to make him look more like his idol Kim Kardashian . Dr Nassif added: 'You can't reverse it most of the time. People say, \"Oh, it's no big deal, go get some fillers!\" Wrong. Incorrect. Be careful.' Other times the outcomes can even be deadly. 'The chances that it could go south, that you could have a complication is real and it's more than one per cent,' he said. The doctors also acknowledged that there is a 'circus act component' to the show, particularly when they are dealing with patients who are obsessed with looking like human dolls or their favorite celebrities, including Jordan James Parke, who has spent thousands to look like Kim Kardashian. While they don't want to help people become 'famous internet freaks', Dr Dubrow explained that it is important for them to fix the patient's surgical problem because 'they still deserve the right to be back in society normally'. Costly obsession: This woman says she has had 300 cosmetic procedures . Seeking perfection: This man said his nose has been 'chopped up more than ahi tuna' before he visited the show's doctors . And giving people that opportunity is a part of what makes the show so rewarding. According to Dr Dubrow, the patients featured on the series have often been 'turned down by every good plastic surgeon in the nation', so he and Dr Nassif are often their 'last hope'. They even had patient this season who went homeless because of trying to correct a botched surgery. 'If we don't use our experience, our education, our training on them, some numbskull with no experience and no education or training is going to try and it's going to get worse,' he said. On tonight's premiere of the show, the doctors are trying to help former reality star Tiffany 'New York' Pollard from VH1 series I Love New York fix her sagging breasts. The doctors will also treat former Baywatch star Nicole Eggert and musician Guillermo Eiland from Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, among others, this season.

His wife said she was still searching for answers Thursday after U.S. officials revealed the 73-year-old American aid worker had been accidentally killed in a U.S. drone strike targeting al Qaeda. \"We were so hopeful that those in the U.S. and Pakistani governments with the power to take action and secure his release would have done everything possible to do so, and there are no words to do justice to the disappointment and heartbreak we are going through,\" Elaine Weinstein said in a statement. \"We do not yet fully understand all of the facts surrounding Warren's death, but we do understand that the U.S. government will be conducting an independent investigation of the circumstances.\" Gunmen abducted Weinstein in 2011 from his home in Lahore, Parkistan. They posed as neighbors, offered food and then pistol-whipped the American aid worker and tied up his guards, his family said. Just a few months after Weinstein's capture, al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri released a recording claiming the terror group was holding Weinstein -- and demanding, among other things, that the United States end airstrikes in Pakistan. U.S. officials called for his release but repeatedly said Washington wouldn't bargain with al Qaeda. Weinstein -- a husband, father and grandfather from Rockville, Maryland -- was 73 years old when he was killed, according to a family website detailing information about his case. He worked in Pakistan as a contractor for the U.S. Agency for International Development from 2004 to 2011, the website says. His employer, Virginia-based consulting firm J.E. Austin Associates Inc., described him as a world-renowned development expert. \"Warren spent his entire life working to benefit people across the globe and loved the work that he did to make people's lives better,\" his wife said Thursday. He loved the Pakistani people and their culture, she said, learning to speak Urdu and doing \"everything he could to show his utmost and profound respect for the region.\" As he announced Weinstein's death Thursday, U.S. President Barack Obama praised what he said was Weinstein's lifelong dedication to service, first as a Peace Corps volunteer and later as a USAID contractor. Weinstein, Obama said, was someone who \"willingly left the comforts of home to help the people of Pakistan,\" focusing his work on helping families escape poverty to give their children a better life. \"This was a man who basically dedicated his life to service, to people in general, but especially to people in a country where the standard of living was low and difficult. ... It's tragic that he was killed the way he was,\" former U.S. Ambassador Dan Simpson said. Simpson met Weinstein in 1968 when they were both working in Burundi -- Simpson as a diplomat and Weinstein as a scholar researching several books. Weinstein \"was a very kind person,\" Simpson said, \"and someone who was very sensitive to the needs of the people who he worked with.\" Another hostage was also killed in the January operation, Italian aid worker Giovanni Lo Porto. U.S. officials knew they were targeting an al Qaeda compound in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region in the January counterterrorism operation, Obama said, but they didn't know that the hostages were also there. Both Lo Porto and Weinstein were people who \"believed passionately\" that they could make a difference, Obama said. \"There could be no starker contrast between these two selfless men and their al Qaeda captors,\" Obama said Thursday. \"Warren's work benefited people across faiths. Meanwhile, al Qaeda boasted to the world that it held Warren citing his Jewish faith.\" Weinstein's health had been deteriorating, Obama said. Last year daughter Alisa Weinstein told CNN her father suffered from a heart condition and severe asthma. But it was still an optimistic time for the family. That month captors released U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, and that buoyed hopes from Weinstein's family that he could also be freed. \"They have shown with this exchange that they can get this done. If they want to, they can do this,\" Alisa Weinstein said at the time. \"So I know that they can do it for us and they can do it for others.\" But a prisoner swap never happened for Weinstein, even though his family pushed for one. Al Qaeda released a video of Weinstein on Christmas 2013. He appeared gaunt and said he was suffering. \"Needless to say, I've been suffering deep anxiety every part of every day, not knowing what is happening to my family and not knowing how they are and because I am not with them,\" Weinstein said in the video. At the time, a former colleague and friend said his appearance in the video was jarring. \"Quite honestly, I didn't recognize him in the picture,\" Laurie Wiseberg told CNN. \"He has changed so dramatically from the person he used to be in terms of appearance and I would hope something could be done so he has a chance to be reunited with his family, his wife, his children and grandchildren, and not have to die in a foreign country far away from those he loves.\" At the time, The Washington Post also reported that it had received a letter from Weinstein. The letter, which was also posted on the website of the SITE Intelligence group, described his background doing human rights work. The letter said that before becoming a consultant in 2003, Weinstein had worked as a college professor at the State University of New York - Oswego, as a Peace Corps country director in Togo and Ivory Coast and for USAID and the World Bank. \"I hope that the media can mount a campaign to get the American government to actively pursue my release and to make sure that I am not forgotten and just become another statistic,\" the letter said. \"Given my age and my health I don't have time on my side.\" Weinstein's wife's statement on Thursday thanked some but also blasted the governments of the United States and Pakistan for not doing more to help her husband. While Maryland members of Congress -- Rep. John Delaney, Sen. Barbara Mikulski and Sen. Ben Cardin -- and members of the FBI were \"relentless\" in efforts to free her husband, she said others in the U.S. government were \"inconsistent and disappointing over the course of 3\u00bd years.\" \"We hope that my husband's death and the others who have faced similar tragedies in recent months will finally prompt the U.S. government to take its responsibilities seriously and establish a coordinated and consistent approach to supporting hostages and their families,\" she said. Pakistani government and military officials also should have done more, she said. \"Warren's safe return should have been a priority for them based on his contributions to their country, but they failed to take action earlier in his captivity when opportunity presented itself, instead treating Warren's captivity as more of an annoyance than a priority,\" she said. \"I hope the nature of our future relationship with Pakistan is reflective of how they prioritize situations such as these.\" But ultimately, she said her husband's captors are the ones responsible for his death. \"I can assure you that he would still be alive and well if they had allowed him to return home after his time abroad working to help the people of Pakistan,\" she said. \"The cowardly actions of those who took Warren captive and ultimately to the place and time of his death are not in keeping with Islam and they will have to face their God to answer for their actions.\" Opinion: Could Weinstein have been saved?

But now the BBC has been accused of dumbing down the Proms \u2013 by holding an Ibiza-style dance party. This year's Proms will include a late-night concert hosted by DJ Pete Tong, who will pay 'homage to Ibiza and its infectious, energetic brand of club music'. Veteran dance DJ Pete Tong (left) will bring club classics to the Royal Albert Hall for this year's Proms. Pictured right is cartoonist Pugh's take on the 'dumbing down' of the Proms . It will take place on July 29, coinciding with the 20th anniversary of Radio 1's broadcasts from Ibiza, and will reinterpret 'club classics' such as Music Sounds Better With You by Stardust and Rhythm Is Rhythm's Strings Of Life. Proms director Edward Blakeman said it was a 'natural' move, adding: 'These 20 years of dance have been a huge phenomenon on Radio 1 so why not celebrate it in a Proms way with a big orchestra? We do now live in a world, thank God, where you can like all kinds of music.' Live music at the so-called Pete Tong Prom will be played by the Jules Buckley Heritage Orchestra, which has worked with pop stars such as Arctic Monkeys, Professor Green and Basement Jaxx. When conductor Sir Henry Wood started the Proms in 1895, he wanted to inspire the public to enjoy top-class classical music. He had accepted a challenge from Robert Newman, manager of the new Queen\u2019s Hall, to \u2018run nightly concerts to train the public\u2019. The plan was to gradually raise the standard of music until they \u2018created a public for classical and modern music\u2019. Sir Henry more than lived up to that challenge. He conducted the first promenade concert, as it was known, offering tickets for as little as a shilling. Audiences could smoke, drink and eat, keeping the atmosphere informal. He established a tradition of playing Wagner on Mondays and Beethoven on Fridays, later adding Debussy, Strauss, Rachmaninov and Ravel. The Proms moved to the Albert Hall in 1941 after the Queen\u2019s Hall was bombed. By the time of Sir Henry\u2019s death in 1944, they were firmly established as the highlight of the classical music calendar. The BBC was accused of 'undermining' the Proms by Conservative Bill Cash, who said: 'The Proms are one of the great British institutions. Like so many institutions, it is under attack by people who think that being novel is necessarily good. The world loves the Proms as they are. It is extremely damaging to undermine the ethos of the Proms by bringing in fake originality. 'The Proms already have a good, convivial finish, and that is part of the tradition, but to undermine the framework and ethos of the Proms is unacceptable.' The Pete Tong Prom is not the only surprising addition to this year's line-up at the Royal Albert Hall, which runs from July 17 to September 12. There will be a 'grime symphony' featuring rapper Wretch 32, and the Last Night Of The Proms will include a singalong section inspired by The Sound Of Music. The series of 92 concerts will also include a tribute to Sherlock Holmes, with a performance of pieces referenced in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's books, including compositions by Wagner and Paganini. It is one of a number of Sunday matinees on the schedule, which are designed to attract families with children as young as five. Sir David Attenborough will host another of the afternoon concerts, featuring music from his natural history television series Life Story. More traditional fare includes the complete Beethoven piano concertos and Sir Simon Rattle conducting Elgar's The Dream Of Gerontius.

She said: 'I had just come back from Las Vegas and felt odd, like I was\u00a0jet-lagged. My legs were heavy and I had pins and needles.' Gemma assumed partying in six-inch heels during her stopover was the cause of the pain in her legs. But for seven months her family watched on as she was left frozen in her own body, unable to move, speak or even swallow as the illness - which affects only one in 50,000 people in the UK - took hold.

Gemma was used to getting sore feet from partying in heels and\u00a0never thought she might end up paralysed . Tests in October 2011 confirmed the diagnosis which led to Gemma first having to use crutches - and now a wheelchair. She spent seven months in the specialist Walton Neuro Rehabilitation Unit\u00a0in Merseyside where she learned to talk, write and even partly walk again.

'It's important to win a match and gain some continuity,' De Sanctis said. 'The last (four) months were tough in terms of results. So to win in front of our fans fills us with pride.' Miralem Pjanic slots home to put Roma ahead in the 25th minute after a clinical counter-attack . Pjanic (second left) celebrates with his team-mates Juan Iturbe, and Daniele de Rossi after scoring . Second-place Roma moved provisionally four points ahead of city rivals Lazio, who play later on Saturday. They had gone seven matches since their last home win - a 4-2 victory over Inter Milan on November 30. Meanwhile, Napoli's winless streak - home and away - was extended to five matches, and Diego Maradona's former club remained fifth.

Steelcase's the Brody WorkLounge is an effort to preserve the privacy and less distractions given in a cubicle while still being a part of an open office work community. On its company website, Steelcase said the Brody is designed to be 'good for your body and good for your brain'. Scroll down for video . Office furniture company Steelcase designed the work space seating to provide privacy in an open office setting (above designs of the Brody WorkLounge) The seating will be available for purchase in late August starting at $2,700 . Brody features an LED task light, privacy screen, foot rest, storage space and personal adjustable work surface . The Brody, which will be available\u00a0late August starting at $2,700, sort of resembles both a desk and an office and is created to limit distractions by creating a shelter while also providing privacy, according to the company. The Cognitive Neuroscience Karolinska Institute in Sweden's work on flow - a passing state of deep concentration where workers are their most productive - informed the design of Brody, according to\u00a0CityLab. 'We had kind of an intuitive understanding of how people liked to study,' Mark McKenna, director of product design at Steelcase\u00a0told Fast Company. 'As the project developed, and as we started diving into what it means to focus and why someone would want to escape, these new findings really helped guide the project.' 'The Brody WorkLounge creates a shelter from visual distractions, provides privacy and provides an enhanced sense of psychological security,' the company said on its website . The design for Brody is based on\u00a0The Cognitive Neuroscience Karolinska Institute in Sweden's work on flow - a passing state of deep concentration where workers are their most productive . In the U.S., 70 per cent of offices have low or no partitions as they embrace open office plans . Each WorkLounge features a mini LED task light, a power outlet, personal work surface that adjusts up to a 40 degree pitch, a privacy screen, a side surface which also serves as an armrest, patented LiveLumbar technology which gives back support, personal storage off of the floor, a foot rest, and a cushion that adapts to each person's size. 'The ability to focus is a real challenge for today's workers and students,' the company said on its website. 'We get interrupted or distracted every 11 minutes and it takes over 23 minutes to get back on task. 'The Brody WorkLounge creates a shelter from visual distractions, provides privacy and provides an enhanced sense of psychological security.' By transforming the under-utilized in-between spaces into these modern alternative to enclaves, where workers can get away for a couple of hours, Steelcase claims its design will help organizations and universities by delivering a 'high-performance work space'. A study revealed that a sense of privacy boosts performance, and Brody WorkLounge strives to provide workers with limited visual distractions . Mark McKenna, director of product design at Steelcase said: 'I think it's clear that people in an office need a place to focus. But the bench is here to stay. It's conducive to collaboration' In recent years, many companies have embraced open offices with about 70 per cent of U.S. offices having no or low partitions, according to the International Facility Management Association. However, a 2013 study revealed that workers are frustrated by the distractions in open offices which lead to poorer work performance, according to the Washington Post. That study also found that nearly half of the surveyed workers in open offices said the lack of sound privacy proved to be a problem for them while more than 30 per cent complained about the lack of visual privacy. Another study\u00a0revealed that having a sense of privacy actually boosts performance. While Brody is not a stance against open offices, it provides a place for people to focus while in an office, McKenna told Fast Company.

Violators will be jailed for ten days, during which time they will be made to take an 'Islamic course', it was reported by anti-ISIS informants in the city.

RBSS says the sanctions are 'volatile and changeable' but notes that they are becoming increasingly more stringent. One resident, named only as Jassem, told the group how dozens of people had fled the city in the wake of the jihadi network's brutal enforcement of its twisted form of sharia law. He said: 'ISIS tightens penalties and uses the principle of intimidation in dealing with public, which led to the migration and escape of many people. 'Freedom of expression has become a crime, so you can not oppose a decision issued by the group. 'Otherwise you will be arrested on charges of violation of God\u2019s law as its fighters claim, but they are far from this law.

Murray missed the majority of last season after rupturing a cruciate knee ligament as Palace won promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs in 2013. The 31-year-old has netted five goals in five games, including in last Monday's defeat of Manchester City, to earn the best goals-per-minute ratio of anyone in the top-flight. Glenn Murray wheels away after scoring the winner for Crystal Palace against Manchester City . The Eagles striker has scored five in five games since returning from a serious knee injury . Pardew said: 'What he did surprise me with on Monday night is his aerial ability. He really was outstanding. 'I don't know if he's got a bionic knee, but he's got an extra spring from somewhere.' Pardew says the Cumbrian has many qualities - pace is not among them - and may have had to adapt his game, like Alan Shearer did, after serious injuries. 'Glenn has had to change his game a little bit and he goes to Sunderland, goals per minute, as the best striker in the Premier League,' Pardew added. 'That is great for him, it really is. It is a great tag for him and he can try and keep it for as long as he can.' Alan Pardew has impressed by Murray's aerial ability, which he claims is down to being fitted with a new knee . The Toon boss believes the Cumbrian forward is reaping rewards from a loan spell with Reading . Pardew believes he is reaping the rewards of Murray being given a chance to find his feet at Reading earlier this season. Murray scored eight goals in 18 games for the Royals, before committing to Palace on Pardew's arrival in January. 'In defending that decision, of Neil Warnock and the board here, of him going out on loan, he probably did need a few games and it's difficult to get them in the Premier League,' Pardew said.

Margaret Gretton, 46,\u00a0has been barred indefinitely from the profession after she referred to the applicant as a member of the terror group and talked of 'bombs and blowing up the school' in an Asian accent. A disciplinary panel of the National College for Teaching and Leadership in Coventry ruled Ms Gretton 'exhibited clear intolerance on the grounds of race, as well as disability'. The panel said she showed no remorse for 'deliberate' and 'repeated' actions while head of Burton Joyce Primary School in Nottingham. They heard that she had mocked special needs students by referring to them as 'cuckoo' and said she didn't want to encourage children 'like that' to come to the school. She even displayed a Golly magnet in her office and made 'monkey noises' on one occasion when talking about black people. Her shocking behaviour continued over a 'sustained period of time' while she was headteacher of the school from September 2007 until November 2013. The panel concluded Ms Gretton 'displayed racist attitudes and behaviour in that - on one or more occasions you inappropriately commented in relation to a photograph of a male Asian job applicant.' It said her comments included 'would you hire me\u2026I'm in the Taliban', or words to that effect, referring to the man as 'Mohammed', or words to that effect, and referring to 'bombs and blowing up the school', or words to that effect, in an Asian accent. A teacher at the school, named only as Staff Member E, told the panel that Ms Gretton said to her, unprompted: 'Do you like black men?' The teacher said she was 'taken aback' by the question, but added that it did not bother her, and her mother's partner was black and from Jamaica. She told the panel that Ms Gretton then 'burst out laughing and said words to the effect of 'does he have big lips?...does he look like a monkey?' and then went on to make monkey noises.' The headteacher denied making the comments, but the panel said it was 'satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the comments, or words similar to them, were made by Ms Gretton. ' The panel also found that she 'expressed inappropriate and discriminatory attitudes towards SEN [Special Educational Needs] pupils in the presence of school staff.' The panel said 'exhibited clear intolerance on the grounds of race, as well as disability' while head of Burton Joyce Primary School in Nottingham (pictured) They said she had used the word 'cuckoo' or words to that affect and said 'we don't want to encourage children like that to come here.' She was also found to have 'deliberately tried to upset' a special needs pupil, 'frightened him', and 'tried to make him cry.' Witness G gave evidence to the panel that on one occasion in 2010 a pupil would not come out from underneath a table and was disrupting the lesson so, as a teaching assistant, she asked Ms Gretton for assistance. She told the panel that 'Ms Gretton said 'It's like something from One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest' and said 'cuckoo, cuckoo' whilst twirling her finger at the side of her head.' A Special Education Needs co-ordinator, who also gave evidence to the panel, said that during a discussion in 2010 about creating a disabled parking space at the school car park she mentioned that Ms Gretton's parking space was the obvious place to put it. However she said that Ms Gretton said: 'We don't want to encourage people like that here.' Ms Gretton was also found to have bullied members of staff which the panel described as 'wholly unacceptable.' It concluded: 'The panel considered that Ms Gretton was not acting under duress, she lacked any insight into her behaviour and demonstrated no remorse. Her shocking behaviour continued over a 'sustained period of time' while she was headteacher of the school (pictured) \u00a0from September 2007 until November 2013 . 'Her actions towards staff and pupils were deliberate, repeated and over a sustained period of time. Ms Gretton seriously abused her position of power and trust within the school. ' After the panel made its recommendations Paul Heathcote, acting on behalf of the Secretary of State, decided to prohibit Ms Gretton from teaching indefinitely. He said: 'This is a case where the teacher has exhibited clear intolerance on the grounds of race, as well as disability.' He added: 'There has been no effort made by Ms Gretton to remedy the attitudinal deficiencies which have led her to behave in the way in which she did.' Describing his decision to prohibit the woman from teaching he said: ' This means that Ms Margaret Leandra Gretton is prohibited from teaching indefinitely and cannot teach in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children's home in England. 'Furthermore, in view of the seriousness of the allegations found proved against her, I have decided that Ms Margaret Leandra Gretton shall not be entitled to apply for restoration of her eligibility to teach.'

The Aston Villa manager knows his ambitions to beat Liverpool and reach the FA Cup final may rest on taming Sterling, a player he tried to sign for Tottenham Hotpur\u2019s academy as a schoolboy. The 20-year-old is enduring a tough time off the pitch, in a contract stand-off with Liverpool and coming under question for his recreational activities. Sterling has been pictured smoking shisha pipes as well as taking so-called \u2018hippy crack\u2019 through a balloon. Sherwood said that was wrong but added: \u2018I have a wee bit of sympathy. I am not condoning it, but he is a young man, isn\u2019t he? He obviously has fortunes but is growing up like everyone else. It is tough in the public eye.\u2019 Sherwood can remember being wowed by a 14-year-old Sterling on the books at Queens Park Rangers, but was unable to convince Spurs to commit the money required to sign him. Instead, Sterling headed to Anfield for \u00a3600,000 in 2010. \u2018A lot of academies pick players on size because the bigger kids normally push the little kids over and their teams can win the games,\u2019 said Sherwood. \u2018He wouldn\u2019t be much different from what he is now but you wouldn\u2019t want to fight him would you?\u2019 Sherwood has been a fan of Liverpool starlet Sterling (left) ever since he was 14 and on the books at QPR .

He added: \u2018I\u2019m sure Steven could still do a job for a Premier League side but I\u2019m not sure he can go and play for anyone other than Liverpool.

Mr Small told WUSA9 that the family has also not received a diagnosis for his daughter's illness. He said she had seemed the picture of health over the weekend, when they played catch together. The medical examiner said it would likely take at least a week to determine what had killed her. Her close friend Devan Rook told the Washington Post that she had thought nothing of it when her friend went to the school nurse on Monday afternoon. 'Didn't think anything was wrong with her,' she said. 'In the middle of the night, she woke up complaining of headaches and stuff, and they took her to [Inova] Loudoun Hospital and realized it was pretty serious. 'They couldn't handle it there, so they medevac-ed her over to [Inova Fairfax Hospital]. At that point, she wasn't doing too well, and several of her organs were shutting down.' Public Health and school district officials said they do not have reason to believe her illness poses a risk to other students, particularly because last week was spring break, WUSA9 reported.

A Houston Uber driver arrested and charged last week with sexually assaulting a female passenger was granted approval to drive for the car service despite being a convicted cocaine dealer. Duncan Burton, 57, was released in November 2012 after 14-years behind bars but was allowed to work for Uber despite city controls prohibiting drug felons driving cabs. Burton was taken into custody on Wednesday on one count of sexual assault and if convicted will face a maximum sentence of 20 years. Uber spokeswoman, Debbee Hancock said on Monday that Burton had passed all the firms background checks before they allowed him to work under their name. However, according to Uber's official background check policy they only review sentences passed down up to seven years ago. That means because Burton was sentence 14-years ago, his drug offense did not register or raise a red flag. Indeed, Burton served 14 years of an 18 year sentence for trying to distribute five kilos or more of cocaine according to the US Bureau of Prisons. That information is readily available online by typing in his name. He was convicted in Houston and served time in Louisana and Georgia before his 2012 release which was commuted because of good behavior. According to Houston regulations someone with a drug conviction is not eligible for a city permit to drive cabs. However, they could appeal and still receive one.

Uber has poached Facebook's security chief Joe Sullivan in an attempt to double down on rapidly escalating safety concerns. The $40 billion taxi service has been plagued by serious accusations of failing to vet its drivers. Lawsuits have been brought against Uber in San Francisco and Los Angeles. A New Delhi driver was accused of raping a passenger in December. This week in Denver, a driver tried and failed to break into a passenger's home. And in London, a woman was allegedly asked to perform oral sex on her driver. Lifeline? Joe Sullivan, 46, will leave his role as Facebook's security chief to help Uber defend safety concerns . These claims, among others, follow a data leak last May, which saw the details of 50,000 current and former drivers released into the public domain. It is hoped Sullivan, the first federal prosecutor to specialize in high-technology crime, can protect Uber from potentially crippling ramifications. The firm's first security chief, he brings with him an extensive portfolio of experience in cyber security and privacy. He spent two decades tackling cyber crime security in the private and public sector before joining the Justice Department. Cases included child protection, bank privacy, and digital strands of 9/11 investigations. Since, he has headed up the security departments at eBay, PayPal, and Facebook. Though his experience lies in digital protection, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has also entrusted the 46-year-old with tackling physical security. Sullivan's role will involve liaising with city and state governments around the world as the firm rapidly expands. Announcing the hire in a blog post on Thursday Kalanick wrote: 'We are both in cyberspace and on city streets all at once; a bridge between bits and atoms. 'And as we get into tens of millions of rides a week, we continue to challenge ourselves to do even better when it comes to safety and data security.' Looking forward: The $40 billion firm's CEO Travis Kalanick announced the news in a blog post on Friday . He added: 'This is a challenge where I get to take what makes Silicon Valley special and apply it to a product that directly impacts people's lives everyday as they move around the world's cities.' There were three high-profile assault cases involving Uber drivers in December 2014. An Indian woman said her driver raped her in New Delhi, leading to outcries and a temporary ban of Uber in that city. It came days after a driver was charged in Boston with raping a young woman. The same week, a woman in London revealed that she was offered \u00a320 credit from Uber after one of its drivers allegedly sexually harassed her during a cab ride. Last week in Denver an UberX driver was arrested after he allegedly dropped a passenger off at the airport before turning around, driving back to her house, and trying to break in.

The man on the phone was the end result of those inquiries. When our colleague want to see them, he was shown a group of children and asked which one he wanted to take. One, two maybe? He escaped by saying he needed to check with his \"madam\" -- me. I called. The man picked up and began referring to me as \"sister.\" I told him we wanted to know what we'd need to do, if we decided we did want to \"foster\" the children. He told me, \"Sister, Jesus will reward me,\" so the \"fostering\" was free, he said. No need for any pesky paperwork -- just a reassurance from me that the children, if I chose to take them, would \"live in my heart.\" If I could also then find it \"in my heart\" to donate to those still in the camp, then that would be \"God's work.\" In spite of the harsh measures the Nigerian government has put in place to punish human traffickers, by the government's own admission, 8 million children are currently engaged in forced labor. The Global Slavery Index says Nigeria has the highest number of people in modern slavery of any sub-Saharan country. Paradoxically, the group also rates Nigeria's anti-trafficking agency, Naptip, as one of the strongest government responses on the continent -- but it's clearly overwhelmed by the realities of working in what is now a zone of military operations, Nigeria's north. As the insecurity in the region has spiraled, the worry is that more and more children are falling through the cracks. And as Boko Haram increases its reliance on child suicide bombers, concerns are growing that orphaned children could end up in the hands of the terror group. At the camp where we finally met the man face to face, there was no attempt at subterfuge. We spoke in normal tones in full view of the children playing. I could have had one of them, I was told, but because I'd specified a younger child, they'd only identified one so far -- a 3-year-old. Did I want to consider an older girl? A 12-year-old maybe? She could look after the 3-year-old, and cook and clean. Either way, two girls would be ready tomorrow, he said. I could see them then. Our last phone conversation revolved around what an appropriate \"donation\" would be in exchange for the children. He couldn't, he said, bargain for it. He then proceeded to do just that, laughing down the phone at my first tentative guess of $200. Laughing again at $300. We finally found a figure he didn't find funny -- $500. I put the phone down and we traveled back to the capital that day to show Naptip what we'd found.", "reference": "CNN team finds a man at \"unofficial\" displaced camp willing to provide children to be \"fostered\"\nHe says he can't take money for them, but eventually demands $500 for two girls ."}, "394": {"id": "3e66f633417327f38da6d30ba1960a68257d78b8", "article": "To commemorate St George's Day, the worlds of football and rugby have collided in a crossbar challenge between England stars of both sporting persuasions.

Scott Shirley, his wife Mayo and seven-year-old son Phoenix, were travelling back to Washington DC after a birthday trip to Disney World, Orlando, when they discovered the vomit and complained to cabin crew. After boarding the plane, the Shirleys were storing their bags under their seats when they noticed their luggage was wet. Scroll down for video . Mayo Shirley, son Phoenix, and husband Scott were forced to sit in seats surrounded by vomit on a United Airlines flight . After putting their luggage on the floor of the cabin, the family discovered the bags to be wet with vomit . Mr Shirley told MailOnline Travel: 'My wife decided to transfer her backpack with all our snacks in it to the spot where my son was sitting. It was then, that she noticed her bag was wet. 'She then rubbed the carpet area on the floor of our seats and discovered the whole area was wet. When she raised her had towards her face to smell the liquid, that's when she made the horrible discovery that the liquid was vomit. 'Given my wife suffers from Mysophobia (phobia of germs), she immediately had a look of panic on her face and loudly pronounced it to be vomit. 'I immediately had a feeling of being grossed out that I too had had my hands all over this vomit. My wife got up and ran towards the bathroom area of the plane with me following behind. 'I told the flight attendant what had happened and she directed us both to the available bathrooms.' The Shirley's luggage remains in the plastic rubbish sacks while they decide how to clean items . Mr Shirley says the family were told by cabin staff that a passenger on an earlier flight had been sick in the seating area, and that staff had cleaned the area. 'It was clear that no one had cleaned the area where we were sitting, because there was no evidence of any chemical smell what so ever,' he added. 'This was purely that distinct smell of vomit on our hands and backpacks.' Mr Shirley described how his wife was so upset she began crying and shaking, and they were given two options by United staff; fly out next day or remain in their seats. Because Mrs Shirley had to go to work next day at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the family say they had no choice but to remain in the seats. The family were flying back on a United Airlines flight from Orlando to Washington (file photo) However, staff allegedly refused to clean and scrub down the affected area, and the passengers were given blankets, which they say did nothing to remove the pungent smell. Mr Shirley said: 'The pilot came out and asked if a resolution had been made. He told us we had to make a decision because he can't delay the other passengers. 'It was at this point I felt as if they couldn't care less about the disgusting situation they had put us in and only cared about moving the flight along. I told my wife that we should just take the next day flight. 'She said it isn't an option for her due to her position with the FDA and the nine days she had already been on holiday. Since we really had no choice in the matter, under duress of the situation, we agreed to the blanket option.' The family were given trash bags by the airline to put their luggage in. 'It was completely humiliating walking through the airport with our belongings in trash bags as if we were some sort of homeless family,' added Mr Shirley. 'I felt that we had to explain what happened to every person who stared awkwardly at us. This was the final straw for me. 'We went straight to United customer service who told us they can't do anything because it involves bags and we would have to go to baggage claim to speak with a supervisor there. This was on the other side of the airport which meant we had to now lug all this stuff there. No assistance was offered.' With their luggage still bagged up, Mr Shirley says United Airlines have offered them a $150 flight voucher each and some 'mileage points' A spokesperson for United Airlines told MailOnline Travel: The situation Mr Shirley described is certainly one that we wish no customer experiences, as our cleaners did not fully clean the seat area prior to departure. 'We offered them an alternate flight, but they decided to remain onboard. Our agents did the best they could in the short time they had to accommodate Mr Shirley and keep the flight on time. 'We\u2019re reaching out to apologise for his experience.' The family were offered a $150 flight voucher, or the option to file a claim for the baggage, which they chose to do. Upon returning home, United has offered the each member of the family a $150 voucher as well as additional mileage points for Mrs Shirley. However, Mr Shirley said: 'I personally feel it is a slap in the face considering all we had to endure on this two hour flight from hell. 'I don't know what the lasting effects are going to be of this experience. We have to fly at least two more times later this year for weddings and I'm beginning to think the train might be an option. 'I felt so uncomfortable the whole time we were flying. All I could think about is what this vomit might have in it and if there was anything we would contact from it.'", "reference": "Scott Shirley, his wife and son were returning from trip to Disneyland .\nBut Mrs Shirley made grim discovery on floor of United Airlines plane .\nMr Shirley claims staff refused to clean area and were offered blankets to cover area up ."}, "396": {"id": "083b6c3239f969ae12491f14fc09b1f17d396983", "article": "(CNN)Authorities in South Carolina have released dash cam video in connection with the fatal shooting of Walter Scott, but the footage does not show the actual shooting. Video from the patrol car of North Charleston's Michael Slager shows an initial traffic stop and early interactions between the officer and Scott. Slager approaches Scott's vehicle. The two men speak. Scott tells the officer he does not have insurance and is in the process of purchasing the vehicle. Slager then returns to his patrol car. Scott exits his vehicle, briefly, and Slager tells him to stay in the car. Scott then gets out of the car, again, and runs away, out of the range of the dash cam. The video, which was released Thursday, also shows a passenger in Scott's car. The passenger's identity was not given in a police report obtained by CNN, but another officer responding to the incident said in the report that the passenger was detained and placed in the back seat of a police vehicle. Scott family attorney Chris Stewart told CNN the man with Scott was a co-worker and friend. He did not identify the friend by name. When asked what might have motivated Scott to run, Justin Bamberg, another attorney for the family, speculated that Scott might have been concerned about child support issues. Scott owed back payments on child support totaling $18,104.43, according to Charleston County family court documents obtained by CNN. He had a bench warrant issued against him for failure to pay at the time he was stopped by Slager. But Bamberg was adamant the dash cam video does not alter what happened. \"This dash cam footage does not change the fact that at the moment the officer shot and killed Mr. Scott -- that shooting was completely unjustified. And that is the key point of both the criminal investigation and the civil lawsuit,\" the lawyer said. The North Charleston Police Department is not providing more information, citing an ongoing investigation of Scott's killing that's being conducted by the independent South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED). Many questions remain about what happened on Saturday when Officer Slager pulled Scott over for what police have said was a broken taillight. In the police report that CNN obtained, a responding officer said that Slager said that at one point he started to chase Scott down a street. \"Shots fired and the subject is down,\" the officer writes that Slager said. \"He took my Taser.\" But a witness who shot cell phone video of the incident says he never saw Scott try to get Slager's Taser. Feidin Santana was walking to work when he saw Slager and Scott struggle on the ground, he told NBC's Lester Holt on Wednesday. Santana then took out his phone and started recording video. \"I remember the police (officer) had control of the situation. He had control of Scott,\" Santana said. Then, Santana said, he heard the sound of a Taser. It seemed to Santana that Scott was trying to get away and avoid being zapped with the Tasered again. On Thursday, a second witness spoke to CNN about what she saw. Gwen Nichols said she was in the neighborhood when she heard police cars speeding by and, curious, she followed them. She saw Scott and Slager at the entrance to a vacant lot. \"It was like a tussle type of thing, like, you know, like, 'What do you want?' or 'What did I do?' type of thing,\" said Nichols, who said she has not yet talked to police about what she saw. \"I didn't hear Mr. Slager saying: 'Stop!' \" she said. Feidin showed the video to the Scott family. But Santana has said fear for his own life almost kept him from revealing the tape. In interviews with MSNBC and NBC, Santana recalled the moments when he recorded the video. \"I ... thought about erasing the video,\" Santana told MSNBC's \"All in With Chris Hayes\" in an interview that aired Wednesday evening. \"I felt that my life, with this information, might be in danger.\" The video shows Slager shooting eight times at Scott as Scott runs away. Witness: I nearly erased shooting video out of fear . An autopsy showed that Scott suffered multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body. Before the officer starts firing his gun in the video, a dark object falls behind him and hits the ground. It's not clear whether that is the Taser. Later in the video, when the officer approaches Scott's body, he drops a dark object next to the man. It's also not clear whether that is the Taser. It's unknown whether Scott took the officer's Taser or whether the officer picked the object up and moved it closer to the body. Slager has been fired and charged with murder. He is white. Scott, who was unarmed, was black. Timeline of events . Scott's shooting stirred memories of the Michael Brown case in Ferguson, Missouri, where an unarmed black teenager was killed by a white police officer. A grand jury declined to indict the officer in that case. But not everyone agreed that Scott's case is like Brown's or that race was a factor. Asked how he felt about Slager being charged with murder, Santana answered that \"no one can feel happy.\" \"He has his family, and Mr. Scott also has his family,\" he told Holt. \"But I think, you know, he made a bad decision. ... Mr. Scott didn't deserve this. And there were other ways that can be used to get him arrested. And that wasn't the proper way to do that.\" Lessons learned from Ferguson to North Charleston . The FBI is investigating, as is SLED. \"I have watched the video, and I was sickened by what I saw,\" North Charleston police Chief Eddie Driggers told reporters Wednesday. Mayor Keith Summey spoke at the same news conference, which was repeatedly interrupted by protesters who chanted: \"No justice! No peace!\" They called for the mayor to step down. Summey said that the city has ordered an additional 150 body cameras \"so every officer on the street\" in the city will have one. That is in addition to 101 body cameras already ordered, he said. Just before the conference was set to begin, demonstrators walked in. They were led by a man wearing a \"Black Lives Matter\" T-shirt who shouted, \"This is what democracy looks like!\" 2010 census data show that North Charleston is 47% black and 42% white. The makeup of the city's Police Department is unclear, though it's been widely reported that 2007 federal figures indicated it was about 80% black. Three of 10 City Council members are black. It's unclear what Slager's motivation was, or if race played a part in Scott's slaying. \"We can't get into the brain of another individual, so we can't state that,\" Scott family attorney Stewart said. \"I think it would be irresponsible to say that and try and inflame a community or anything of that nature.\" If convicted, Slager could face life in prison or the death penalty. Who is Officer Slager? An autopsy of Scott showed that he \"sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body,\" and his death was the result of a homicide, the Charleston County Coroner's Office said. Asked whether CPR was performed on Scott after Slager shot him, Driggers said: \"In the end of it (the video), what I saw was (what I) believed to be a police officer removing the shirt of the individual and performing some type of life-saving (procedure), but I'm not sure what took place there.\" When Scott's brother Anthony saw the video, he was convinced Slager's account of what happened was not true, he told CNN. \"There was not a struggle for the Taser,\" Anthony Scott said. \"I didn't believe my brother would have done that anyway.\" To  Anthony Scott, the videotape shows his brother was \"running for his life\" away from the officer. \"I think my brother was thinking he was not going to be shot, no one would have thought that,\" Scott said. Family members have adamantly repeated that they don't want protests over Scott's slaying to become violent. And, so far, the demonstrations have been passionate but peaceful. Scott's mother, Judy Scott, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that she feels \"forgiveness in my heart, even for the guy that shot and killed my son.\" \"He was a loving son, a loving father,\" she said. \"He cared about his family and ... no matter what happens, it will not replace my son.\" Who was Walter Scott?

Jeff McCubbery, 72, from Mandurang and Ian Bullock, 65, from Blackburn devised the plan for Captain Cootie Cards over twenty years ago in a bid to counter the influx of lingo from overseas. The pair now has a quirky range of greeting cards, coffee mugs, stubby-holders and calendars \u2013 but their hopes of spreading the message were dashed after they were spurned by the companies they pitched their products to. An Illustration from best mates Ian Bullock and Jeff\u00a0McCubberry, who have vowed to keep Aussie slang alive through a range a range of custom memorabilia . McCubberry told Daily Mail Australia they designed the idea after meeting on a fishing trip 25 years ago. 'We met at an annual fishing trip, and quickly learned we shared the belief that the language we grew up with was waning.' 'People are dorks not drongos, guys not blokes. We decided to do something to keep the vocabulary afloat,' McCubbery said. 'We decided to consolidate the Australianisms we knew and loved from our upbringings-instead of the Americanisms which have ,' said Ian Bullock. With Ian Bullock (left) as illustrator and and Jeff McCubbery (right) as designer, the duo have devised a range of\u00a0greeting cards, coffee mugs, stubby-holders and calendars emblazoned with down under lingo . One illustration depicts weather forecast map with the various Australian climatological zones \u2013 the Northern Territory is 'bloody muggy' , Alice Springs is 'dry as a dead dingo's donger', and Victoria is 'cold as a witch's tit'. Another card shows a fisherman sleeping next to a lake with beer can in hand and the accompanying message: 'flat out like a lizard drinking.' McCubberry believes the rise of television and the internet has let a torrent of lingo loose from Britain and America that has eclipsed the home grown counterpart. McCubberry said when the pair met on a fishing trip 20 years ago 'we quickly learned we shared the belief that the language we grew up with was waning' The best mates use lingo from their upbringing which they say has disappeared, such as the term: 'I don't give a rats a**' With McCubberry as designer and Bullock as illustrator, the mates got to work on a range of products that embody down under speech from a bygone time. But much to their dismay the pair got a rude shock when time came to pitch the product a manufacturers. 'Nobodies interested, said McCubbery. 'They say it's too crude or uncouth. It doesn't make sense because colourful language is a pivotal part of Aussie culture.' The duo plan to launch a digital campaign in hopes of finding a distributor to get their products on the market . Bullock said they had a deal with a major distributor that fell through before another wholesaler offered them a rather insulting rate to print the cards. 'It was pretty insulting really. It's been a real knock back but we're determined to stick at it.' The mates plan to launch a website and social media campaign in hopes of finding a distributor to get their products on the market. 'It's just a matter of getting my head around the online thing.

After all, the actor was serious when he recently told Variety \"It will probably win best picture at the Oscars, unless the Oscars don't want to be relevant ever.\" But rather than ignore it because it's a glossy, blockbuster action film, some might argue that the movie goes against type for Academy Award nominated films because the cast is so diverse. \"Furious 7\" hits theaters Friday, months after controversy was stirred about the lack of diversity at the Oscars. There were no actors of color nominated and no women in the directing category, which was dominated by white males. Mexican filmmaker Alejandro Gonzalez I\u00f1arritu went on to win best director for \"Birdman.\" The lack of diversity was so glaring (even with the mostly black cast of the movie \"Selma,\" which received a nomination for best picture) that it spurred the Twitter hashtag \"#OscarsSoWhite.\" In contrast, \"Furious 7\" couldn't be more racially and ethnically inclusive. The cast includes Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson -- a Samoan/black man -- black actors Christopher \"Ludacris\" Bridges and Tyrese Gibson, Hispanic performer Michelle Rodriguez, Thai martial artist Tony Jaa, Beninese expatriate Djimon Hounsou and the late Paul Walker, a blue-eyed, blond-haired California native. The filmmakers even went so far as to make sure casting directors in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, where key scenes were filmed, found diverse extras. \"We were mainly looking for the diverse look of the (United Arab Emirates),\" Miranda Davidson, owner of the casting company, told The National. \"They really wanted to make sure we reflected the international feel of the country.\" Almost since the beginning, the \"Fast and Furious\" films have had a diverse focus and appeal.  The band of street racers, which encompassed white, black, Asian, Hispanic, male and female and bond as a family, has done well at the box office with each iteration. In 2011, then Boston Globe film critic Wesley Morris wrote, \"Go on and laugh your Benetton, Kumbaya, Kashi, quinoa laugh, but it's true: The most progressive force in Hollywood today is the 'Fast and Furious' movies.\" \"They're loud, ludicrous, and visually incoherent,\" he said. \"They're also the last bunch of movies you'd expect to see in the same sentence as 'incredibly important.' But they are -- if only because they feature race as a fact of life as opposed to a social problem or an occasion for self-congratulation. (And this doesn't even account for the gay tension between the male leads, and the occasional crypto-lesbian make-out.)\" According to the Motion Picture Association of America's 2014 Theatrical Market Statistics Report, while Hispanics make up 17% of the U.S. population they account for 25% of frequent moviegoers. Likewise, women make up 52% of moviegoers. Entertainment Weekly points out that the film franchise is doing a much better job of reflecting its audience than others in Hollywood. \"Despite the films' cumulative worldwide gross of almost $2.4 billion, their racial inclusiveness remains an outlier; American movies are still overwhelmingly white,\" EW's Chris Lee writes. \"According to UCLA's 2015 Hollywood Diversity Report, a mere 16.7% of 2013 films starred minorities in lead roles.\" At least one moviegoer tweeted that he appreciated the effort. Diesel told EW the franchise has come a long way from the original 2001 film, which featured segregated gangs of racers pitted against each other. \"It doesn't matter what nationality you are,\" the star said. \"As a member of the audience, you realize you can be a member of that 'family.'

Gone, show organizers hope, will be the scantily-clad \"car babes\" that in previous years have posed provocatively on car hoods and sashayed through the aisles to draw crowds to the 9-day event. The focus, instead, will be the latest offerings from an array of global car manufacturers, which -- models or not -- are pulling out all the stops to compete for Chinese customers in what since 2009 has been the world's largest car market. \"It's a major industry event for us,\" said Andrew Boyle, global product communications manager at Rolls Royce. It sells several hundred of its super-luxury vehicles in China each year, and in Shanghai this week will launch its latest model, the Phantom Limelight. Vehicle sales in China totaled 23.5 million units last year, almost a third more than in the United States. However, the show comes at a turning point for China's auto market, which is facing a second year of slower growth in 2015 after a decade-long sales and production frenzy. Intense competition for China's drivers means that car manufacturers are increasingly developing vehicles that cater to Chinese preferences. Nissan will use Auto Shanghai 2015 to unveil the Lannia mid-size sedan, which it says has been specially created for \"the rising young Chinese generation.\" The country's gearheads have embraced the SUV or sport utility vehicle, sales of which jumped a third last year, and many will feature in the displays planned by dozens of European, Japanese U.S., South Korea and Chinese automakers. This year MG, once known for its sleek sports cars and now owned by Shanghai Automotive Industries Corp, enters the fray with its first SUV, the GS, while Ford will give two new luxury SUVs their China market debut --  the Lincoln MKX and Lincoln Navigator, the latter favored by hip hop stars. \"The SUV is popular as a first car,\" said Raymond Tsang, a Shanghai-based partner at consultancy Bain & Company. \"If you only have one, you want one that you can commute in and take on a road trip.\" Foreign brands have dominated sales in the past two years, but as they improve product quality and design, local rivals like Geely, which also owns Sweden's Volvo, and Great Wall Motor are clawing back market share, especially when it comes to SUVs. Geely, which already exports to Russia, the Middle East and Africa, is also stepping up its efforts to crack more developed markets. It is preparing to export the Volvo S60 Inscription to the United States from a factory in the southwestern city of Chengdu. It would be the first car made in China to hit U.S showrooms and may pave the way for Chinese brands to shake up the U.S. market like Japanese and Korean car manufacturers did decades earlier. With car ownership still at much lower levels than the U.S. and Europe, China is likely to remain the industry's most important market for decades. However, the breakneck growth may be a thing of the past. In 2014, growth in sales halved to 7% and according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, the slowdown continued in the first three months of this year when sales rose just 3.9%. It comes as the wider economy slows and a prolonged campaign against corruption has hit sales of luxury vehicles, especially brands like Audi that have been the ride of choice for Chinese officials. On top of that, the hassles of car ownership are deterring some potential buyers, as is an awareness of the environmental costs. Congested and chaotic roads, restrictions on the number of new vehicle license plates and a shortage of residential parking space  may trigger a backlash against car ownership, according to a recent report from Bain & Company. \"The car was seen as a status symbol,\" says Pierre-Henri Boutot, a partner at Bain and co-author of the report. \"But now in larger cities they see the hassle and some of these people are thinking of giving up their car.\" Just maybe, China will need those car babes to boost sales after all.", "reference": "Organizers want to ban scantily-clad models at car show .\nThe Shanghai Auto Show is a key event for global automakers .\nCars are no longer the status symbol they once were in China ."}, "400": {"id": "1d965b7ef3e3aa66f4b55ca424496c3ff7307dcf", "article": "Baseball has long been considered America's favorite pastime, so it should come as no surprise that most people feel very strongly when it comes to their favorite professional team.

The pair, who are in their 30s, were convicted of noise pollution and harassment for the 'raucous screams' during steamy sex sessions at their apartment in the northern town of San Martino. Their long-suffering neighbours, who first took them to court in 2009, described the wails of passion as 'deafening' and said it kept them and their two children awake. The couple, who are in their 30s, have been ordered to pay \u00a39,000 after being convicted of noise pollution and harassment for the 'deafening' screams during sex sessions at their home in San Martino, Italy (file picture) The man, who has not been named, was sentenced to four months in prison in 2011, and his fianc\u00e9e given a noise abatement order. But the couple appealed the sentence and have now been ordered to pay \u00a37,000 in damages to their neighbours who now live elsewhere, and \u00a32,000 in legal fees. The apartment next door to the noisy couple currently remains unoccupied, the Provincia Pavese newspaper said. It comes less than six months after a woman from Tyne and Wear, in the north east of England, was given a 12-week jail term and a four-year anti-social behaviour order (ASBO) for having noisy sex. Neighbours complained about Caroline Cartwright's loud screams during sex sessions with her husband of 38 years and moaned that they could hear the bed banging against the wall from the adjacent house. At the time, Mrs Cartwright explained: 'It was a metal headboard so it used to bang on the wall. 'There was no carpet back then, so when you have sex, the bed goes back and forward. 'If you get to a point where the bed's banging on the wall, you're not going to stop, are you? 'As far as I'm concerned, that's what you should be doing. Just relax. Go with the flow. It's not as if I'm having sex and think: \"Oh, I'm making too much noise. I better be quiet\".' Mrs Cartwright was initially handed a noise abatement order which was later upgraded to an ASBO after she breached the order five times. The ASBO forbade her from 'shouting, screaming and vocalisation' during sex or from playing loud music. Caroline Cartwright, from Tyne and Wear, was jailed for 12 weeks and handed a four-year ASBO for having noisy sex with her husband of 38 years, Steve. Neighbours complained about Mrs\u00a0Cartwright's loud screams . Caroline and Steve (pictured together above leaving court last year) were visited by police countless times after neighbours complained their sex sessions were loud enough to drown out television programmes . However, in a bid to get around the restrictions, Mrs Cartwright switched her sex sessions to the morning leaving neighbours - who complained that she was noisy enough to drown out their TVs - less than impressed. 'I wasn't supposed to make excessive noise that could be heard in a neighbouring property or outside,' she explained. Mrs Cartwright was later arrested and admits she was even having sex with her husband Steve when police arrived to take to her into custody. The 53-year-old was taken to court, handed an eight-week suspended prison sentence and forced to live in a bail hostel for weeks. A year later, and after scores more complaints and visits from the police, she was again arrested for breaching her ASBO following two police callouts in two days. Again, she was handed a suspended sentence, this time for 12 weeks, and sent to live in a bail hostel where she was held alongside serious criminals, including murderers. However, despite her convictions, Mrs Cartwright, who has since bought a less noisy wooden bed, remains adamant that she's done nothing wrong. She said: 'I don't see why I should stop having sex in my own house with my husband of 38 years. 'I'm sure there could be a lot worse things I could be doing. They all thought it was stupid I was in prison. 'I mean I was in the same prison as people like Rose West for making a noise when I have sex.

The prosecutors' office in Seoul said Kim, was charged with attempted murder, violence against a foreign envoy and obstruction of duty. Kim, 55, was a known maverick activist who had been handed a two-year suspended sentence in 2010 for hurling a rock at the then Japanese ambassador to Seoul. He has denied any intention to kill Lippert, but the prosecutors office said in a statement that the crime was clearly deliberate. 'There was an intention to murder because (Kim) used a lethal weapon in a pre-meditated crime to attack the ambassador's face and neck repeatedly,' it said. Kim has told investigators the ambassador was the 'symbolic' target of his opposition to annual US-South Korea joint military exercises, which he blames for blocking dialogue with North Korea. The annual drills have long been condemned by Pyongyang as rehearsals for invasion. Kim insisted he had acted alone and not on the orders of Pyongyang, but prosecutors said they were looking into whether he has violated the South's strict National Security Law banning any act seen as aiding North Korea or promoting its ideology. Investigators have ransacked Kim's home as part of an investigation into Kim's possible links with North Korea. Kim had visited the North seven times and once tried to erect a memorial in Seoul to the late North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il after his death in 2011.

Tony Blair's global money-making projects face fresh scrutiny today after publication of a bizarre deal to sell the theory of 'deliverology' to Colombia. Questions have also been raised about why the fees for the former Labour Prime Minister \u2013 who last week denied being in the 'league of the super-rich - are being paid by the United Arab Emirates, and not the Colombian government. The contract sets out in great detail Mr Blair's demands for confidentiality, and includes a requirement that his wife Cherie join him on trips to South America. Mr Blair last week defended earning money since leaving Downing Street, claiming it pays for the 'infrastructure' around him. But critics have questioned the role of a former Prime Minister working for other sovereign states, and claimed there could be a conflict of interest between his role as the Middle East envoy and earning money from governments in the region. Today the Sunday Telegraph revealed details of a contract signed between Mr Blair and the Colombian government in 2013. Fees paid to Tony Blair Associates for the work advising Colombia on its mining industry, which brings in \u00a32billion-a-year in royalties. The 34page contract for a year was signed between Columbia's department of national planning, and Windrush No 3 LP, an arm of Mr Blair's business network. It included carrying out a 'stocktake' of mining deals and contains at least 10 clauses on confidentiality. It also boasts that Tony Blair Associates outperforms rival consultancy firms because it works with 'founders of deliverology' \u2013 jargon for the way governments can get things done. 'All our team members will have expertise in ... deliverology or mining induced growth strategies,' it says. The business proposal states: 'Mr Blair, with his extensive on-the-job experience and politician instincts, will personally lead this project. 'Typically his contribution will go beyond the narrow focus of the specific project, and our growing understanding of the situation on the ground will allow Mr Blair to serve as an adviser to the government in several other areas, be it in domestic matters or questions of international politics.' Tory MP Andrew Bridgen today called for curbs on former Prime Minister's working for other governments. He told MailOnline: 'Anyone who has been Prime Minister and privy to the secrets of this nation should hold should never work for another sovereign government.' Mr Bridgen says ex-PMs should be bound for life by the seven principles of public life, known as the Nolan principles, which include accountability and openness.' He added: 'People have got the right to earn money but it is how it is done. At the end of the day I think a lot of the disillusion with politics began in the Blair years. The fall of politicians' standing seriously began in the Blair years when people felt they had been deceived.' Mr Blair defended his money making, telling Newsweek last week said: 'I could not do what I do unless I was also able to generate income'. He added: 'Am I better off than most people? Yeah, I'm very lucky. Am I in the league of the super-rich? Absolutely not, though you will have to make up your own mind about that.' The Colombia contract includes a clause stating that Mr Blair would make two trips a year to Colombia, and he gets to choose who joins him. It specifically includes a statement that this could be his wife Cherie. The Colombia contract also includes a clause stating that Mr Blair would make two trips a year to Colombia, and he gets to choose who joins him. It specifically includes a statement that this could be his wife Cherie. The Columbian government announced at the time that that 'the United Arab Emirates through the Office of Tony Blair [Windrush Ventures No 3 LP] domiciled in the UK' had signed an agreement 'to support the implementation' of the new laws on spending money raised from mining deals. Another deal was signed in 2014, for offering advice on project management, according to the newspaper. Chris Doyle, director of the Council for Arab-British Understanding, told the Telegraph: 'This raises serious questions of a conflict of interest over Mr Blair's roles as businessman and Middle East envoy. 'The UAE is supposed to be a leading donor government on the issue of Gaza and the West Bank, so what does Tony Blair put first, his role as Quartet envoy or his role as a businessman when dealing with them? What is the nature of all these contracts? There is still a lack of transparency about it.' Mr Blair is working with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, for whom he once a foreword for a political book on The Third Way . But Mr Blair's office rejected the claims, and insisted the details of the work had been released in a press statement in 2013. 'There is absolutely nothing improper in this project being funded by UAE\u2026 on the contrary the sole objective is to support the Colombian Government's reform programme which aims to modernise public services and increase prosperity for its people. 'The TBA team works exclusively in the interest of and for the benefit of the Government of Colombia. As with any project, we maintain the strict confidentiality requirements of our contract. 'TBA has also been helping establishing a Delivery Unit, so that the government can better deliver services which will increase jobs, reduce poverty and transform the lives of people in Colombia. The work being undertaken is solely for the benefit of Colombia and is at no cost to the government and provided close to cost. 'We have no knowledge let alone involvement in the mining deal you refer to and any suggestion that we have been involved is false, neither were TBA involved in any laws relating to mining fees or royalties.

The South African army has been deployed to areas that remain volatile after a spate of attacks targeting immigrants, the defense minister announced on Tuesday. Soldiers have already been sent to support police in troubled areas, Defense Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula said in a live broadcast. The minister made the announcement in Alexandra, a Johannesburg township where a Zimbabwean couple survived a shooting overnight. The man and woman were both shot in their necks and the woman suffered an additional shot in her leg, the minister said. Both Zimbabweans were treated and discharged from hospital. Troops have also been sent to Durban, the coastal city where the attacks on foreigners began, Mapisa-Nqakula said. The violence has been concentrated in areas of Johannesburg and Durban where poor immigrants and South Africans live. The recent spate of attacks has mainly affected immigrants from African states like Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, according to a statement from the aid group, Doctors Without Borders.

Many firemen have not been trained in basic first aid \u2013 yet they are being left to care for seriously ill elderly patients for hours while they wait for an ambulance. The Fire Brigades Union say the practice is irresponsible and dangerous but is becoming increasingly common because the ambulance service is so overstretched. The ambulance service is becoming increasingly reliant on firemen to attend life-threatening emergencies . The Fire Brigade Union say the practice is irresponsible and dangerous and becoming more common . Senior union officials say fire engines are routinely being turned into makeshift ambulances to ferry patients to A&E. They normally carry a few blankets, oxygen masks to protect against smokes and a defibrillator \u2013 to restart the heart. In one case earlier this year an elderly lady is feared to have died because she was left in the hands of fire crews for nearly 40 minutes while paramedics were delayed. The ambulance service is facing unprecedented demand from the rising and aging population and in some areas 999 calls are up by 15 per cent on last year. Paramedics are also having to respond to rising numbers of non-urgent calls from patients frustrated that they cannot get an appointment with their GP. They are also having to waste much of their time queued up outside A&E units which cannot accept their patients because staff there are also very busy. This has all led to the ambulance service increasingly relying on firemen to attend potentially life-threatening emergencies. The Fire Brigades Union yesterday warned that South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue were sending firemen with no medical training to 999 calls instead of ambulances. It pointed out that only a third of firefighters at this branch had any medical training \u2013 and even this only consisted of a four day course of basic first aid. Yet in one case they were left to help an elderly lady who had stopped breathing for 45 minutes whilst they waited for the ambulance to arrive. Senior union officials say fire engines are routinely being turned into makeshift ambulances to ferry patients to A&E . In another, they tended to a pensioner who had fallen and banged her head for two hours before they were forced to leave her on her own \u2013 to attend a fire. The practice is occurring across the country and last July, firemen took a 16-year-old girl with suspected bleeding on the brain to A&E in Warrington, Cheshire . In December, crews were sent to a care home in Ryde on the Isle of Wight where an elderly woman had a stroke and were ordered to cut the rings off her fingers which were turning blue because of poor blood flow. Ian Murray, vice-president of the Fire Brigades Union \u2013 which represents 44,000 firemen \u2013 said: 'We know only a small percentage of firefighters are trained to give basic first aid. 'It is irresponsible and dangerous to put untrained firefighters in the position of attending incidents to assist the ambulance service, with the knowledge that it is highly unlikely one will arrive for some considerable time.' In January, a woman of 84 from Doncaster is feared to have died because firemen were sent to her home rather than an ambulance.

The Magpies have lost their last six Barclays Premier League games under caretaker manager John Carver and more demonstrations are planned for the visit of Swansea after a significantly smaller crowd than usual saw last weekend's 3-1 home defeat to Tottenham. Campaign organisers protesting over Mike Ashley's ownership have said they will support anyone who wishes to boycott once again and have asked fans to stand up on 34 minutes inside St James' Park on Saturday - to reflect the \u00a334million the club left in the bank during the last financial year rather than investing in the squad. Newcastle United fans have planned a mass protest against owner Mike Ashley on Saturday afternoon . At least 10,000 supporters stayed away from St James' Park for the club's last home game against Spurs . Fans are unhappy at the club's lack of ambition, despite owner Ashley having \u00a334million in the bank . But Monk claims the backdrop to the game will have no bearing on the actual 90 minutes, saying: 'As a player there's nothing you can do about that - you have to concentrate on your football. 'No player goes out on the pitch without the intention of giving his best and I'm sure all the Newcastle fans will be thinking that. 'They'll want to put on a display and do well in front of their crowd and bounce back from recent results, and as a player you are there to perform.' The supporters' group have asked fans to stand in the 34th minute of Saturday's  match against Swansea . Carver was handed the Newcastle reins until the end of the season after Alan Pardew quit the club in late December to become Crystal Palace boss. And Monk sees similarities between himself and Carver as he became Swansea manager in February 2014 with the Welsh outfit involved in a relegation battle at the time. 'I was in that position at the end of last season, although maybe it's a little bit different because John's been a coach for a number of years and has got that experience,' said Monk, whose side have equalled Swansea's best ever Premier League points total with five games still remaining. Fans boycotting the Spurs match hold banners demanding the resignation of Ashley as Newcastle director . 'But in terms of taking over at a difficult moment for the club and trying to get results straight away, it's similar. 'The times I've met him, he's a fantastic guy with a lot of experience, he speaks well and is pushing his players to get the best. That's in his character, and you see that in his interviews. 'I have sympathy for him in a way because as a manager you have to get results, but I'm sure he is giving 100 per cent and putting all his knowledge and experience into it.' Newcastle supporters have also been asked to take part in peaceful protests outside Sports Direct stores . Swansea are unbeaten on their three Premier League visits to Newcastle, winning twice and drawing once, and secured their top-flight status last season by winning 2-1 at St James' Park towards the end of April. 'We've done well there over the years and it's a great place to go and play your football,' Monk said. 'You're in the game to play in those big stadiums and our players are used to those arenas now as they are established Premier League players. 'Hopefully we can use the crowd against the team if we perform well, but the idea is to focus on ourselves and put our best football on the pitch.'

The big-hitting top-order batsman has nine England caps to date, since his debut against India last August. But after opening alongside Alastair Cook four times in that series defeat, Hales has played in only five of England's subsequent 18 matches - including at the World Cup - and has batted instead at number three on three occasions. Alex Hales is hoping for a 'proper crack' at one-day international cricket with England . The 26-year-old is hoping for more continuity when England resume their ODI schedule this summer. Asked if he thinks he has had little of that so far, he told The Guardian: 'Honestly, yes I do. 'I don't feel like I've had a proper crack at it yet. 'I played the back-end of last summer against India, did okay without setting the world alight - and since then, it has been the odd game, coming in, dropping out again.' Hales was his own critic, after making an encouraging 40 on debut in Cardiff. Since the series against India last August,\u00a0Hales has played in only five of England's subsequent 18 matches . He admitted back then, before his second innings, that India's seamers had limited his strokeplay, claiming: 'They were just very cunning. Once I got past 30, they were one step ahead of me. 'So it's up to me to put that right, and have that game smartness.' Nonetheless, he takes issue with the theory that he has been 'worked out' already at ODI level. He added: 'I read the press and saw the stuff about 'bringing the ball back in' and that I had been worked out - I got bowled once by Bhuvneshwar Kumar with an inswinger. 'That's not being worked out - that's a good delivery.' Nottinghamshire big-hitter Hales was run out last Sunday as his county battled to draw against Middlesex . Moeen Ali was preferred at the top of the order, alongside Cook in the series defeat in Sri Lanka and then with Ian Bell at the World Cup. 'Getting the news at the start of that Sri Lanka tour that I wasn't going to get first crack dented my confidence quite a bit,' said Hales. 'Maybe I let it affect me in a negative way.

Along with a thriving cultural scene, there are good restaurants, great shopping and exciting nightlife. This week saw the opening of Centre Pompidou Malaga, the first of several popup versions of the famous Parisian gallery planned outside France. It is housed in a low-slung white building topped with a giant glass cube in the trendy harbour area. When I turn up, a large crowd is queuing to pay the \u00a36.70 entrance fee to view 90 works by artists such as Miro, Magritte and Picasso on loan from the Pompidou in France, plus an exhibition exploring dance and choreography. There's a brilliant room of self-portraits, including a Francis Bacon and Frida Kahlo. Drawing a big huddle is Kader Attia's striking installation, Ghost \u2014 a mass of Muslim women in prayer, made from tin foil. Pompidou is the latest bold step in branding Malaga a 'City of Museums'. Across town, the first overseas branch of St Petersburg State Russian Museum has just opened in a refurbished tobacco factory. Take a good look: Gibralfaro Castle offers fine views of the city, with the Mediterranean as a wide backdrop . Next door is the Malaga Automobile Museum, an extraordinary celebration of cars, fashion and art. By 2016, a Museum of Fine Arts and Archaeology will complete the set. Malaga's Picasso Museum opened in 2003 \u2014 a long-held dream of the artist, who was born in the city in 1881. The Automobile Museum in Malaga houses around 90 classic cars, plus displays of haute couture . Round the corner, you can peek into Santiago church where he was baptised. The Picasso Birthplace Museum in the house where he lived until he was ten, contains more paintings, ceramics, early photos, belongings and sketchbooks. What sets Malaga apart \u2014 for now, at least \u2014 is that all these galleries tend to be uncrowded, refreshingly small, and most in walking distance of each other. That means there's plenty of time to explore Andalusian cuisine. Get in the mood at the buzzing Atarazanas market, then try the terrace at El Pimpi, which overlooks the Roman amphitheatre. For unbeatable seafood, take the bus to the beach at Pedregalejo on the city's outskirts, where locals feast on freshly caught boquerones (anchovies, often deep fried), espetos (sardines, barbecued on sticks) and platters of enormous mussels, prawns and clams. For modern minimalism, head to the sleek gastrobars of the arty Soho district, such as KGB, where punky young things queue for tables. 'Seville just stays the same,' one girl tells me over fusion tapas and a beer. 'Malaga is moving on.' Green and pleasant: Malaga's botanical garden plays host to exotic plants from around the world . Near the Pompidou is the city's botanic gardens, rated as one of the best in Europe and bursting with palms, exotic plants and squawking birds. Also to see are the Moorish Alcazaba fortress and Gibralfaro castle, where you can enjoy fabulous panoramic views of the city. Visitor numbers are already soaring \u2014 with some people saying Malaga will be like Barcelona in ten years' time. I'm tempted to agree with them.

The only other prisoner who rode in a police van with Freddie Gray on April 12 told investigators that he believed the 25-year-old was trying to hurt himself, according to a leaked affidavit . A prisoner who shared a ride to jail with Freddie Gray claims the 25-year-old was trying to injure himself inside a police van before he died from unexplained spinal cord injuries, according to a leaked police report. The report was leaked to the Washington Post under the proviso that the prisoner remains anonymous - raising questions about its accuracy and the favorable light which it shines on the Baltimore police force . In the documents, the unidentified prisoner says he was loaded into a police van after Gray on April 12, and apparently told investigators that he heard Gray 'banging against the walls' and 'intentionally trying to injure himself'. However, he claims he could not see what Gray was doing, since they were separated by a metal partition. The statement was cited in a warrant to search an arresting officer's clothing for possible traces of Gray's DNA. The Washington Post obtained the affidavit from a person who asked the prisoner, who remains jailed for violating a restraining order, not be identified for fears over their safety. Officials in Baltimore\u00a0have warned protesters that the investigation into Freddie Gray's death will not be resolved by tomorrow - despite rumors to the contrary. City chiefs have been attempting to manage growing expectations they will immediately decide whether to prosecute six officers involved in the arrest of Gray who later died of injuries he apparently received while in custody. Authorities confirmed they plan to turn over\u00a0findings of a police investigation into the death to a state's attorney by Friday. In the past week, Gray has become the new face of the 'Black Lives Matter' movement, with many believing his death was caused by police during or after the arrest. His death has not only prompted demonstrations in Baltimore, but in several cities across the nation. However, just how Gray sustained the life-ending injuries has remained unclear with both the Baltimore Police and Department of Justice revealing little of their respective on-going investigations. The assertion that Gray may have caused his own death in the back of the police van was quickly rejected by an attorney hired by his family. 'We disagree with any implication that Freddie Gray severed his own spinal cord,' attorney Jason Downs told the Post. 'We question the accuracy of the police reports we\u2019ve seen thus far, including the police report that says Mr Gray was arrested without force or incident.' And local reporters have also found inconsistencies with the leaked affidavit. According to WBAL reporter Jayne Miller, police originally said that the second prisoner in the van told investigators that Gray was 'mostly quiet'. Sources also told the station that by the time the second prisoner was in the van, Gray was unresponsive. Cell phone footage captured the moment Gray was arrested by police near a housing project in west Baltimore on April 12. Police say Gray fled when they tried to talk to him, and that after tackling him to the ground they found him carrying an illegal switchblade knife and took him into custody. Scroll down for video . Clues: The hour-long period between Gray's arrest (captured in bystander video above) and his arrival at the hospital has remained a relative mystery until the Washington Post obtained the sealed affidavit . Gray appeared to still have some mobility when officers were putting him into the police van, but it's unclear how much officers were aiding him into the car . Gray died the morning of April 19 at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center from his spinal injuries . In the bystander video, two officers are seen pinning Gray to the concrete with their knees. When they pick him up to lead him to the van, Gray appears to struggle with walking and can be heard yelling out in pain. The image of Gray being placed in the van is the last time he is seen before arriving at the hospital about an hour later with a partially severed spinal cord. Police have so far denied causing Gray's injuries, but have not explained how he became so severely injured in their custody. Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts claims Gray had the capacity to walk since he is seen stepping into the police van in the bystander video. About five minutes into the 30-minute ride, the police officer driving the vehicle pulled over to put Gray in leg irons. That officer described Gray as 'irate' and 'continued to be combative in the police wagon', Batts said. Angered: Gray's death has sparked protests not only in Baltimore, but across the nation. Above, thousands took part in a student-led protest in Baltimore on Wednesday . After another five minutes, the officer made yet another stop, asking another cop to check on Gray. That officer found Gray on the floor because he had not been properly restrained with a seat belt \u00a0-a violation of department policy. During this stop, Gray asked for medical help due to his asthma and Batts said officers ignored Gray's worries and continued on to pick up the other prisoner - the 38-year-old man quoted in the recently-released affidavit. When the van arrived at the jail for booking 30 minutes after Gray's arrest, he was found on the floor of the vehicle unconscious. He was taken straight to the hospital, and died a week later due to a severed spinal cord. The Baltimore Police Department is still conducting their investigation into Gray's arrest. It was originally thought that the report would be released on Friday, when the department hands over their findings to the state attorney's office. However, a police spokesman clarified that statement on Wednesday, saying they would be not be releasing anything to the public \u00a0and the decision to do so would be up to prosecutors. Six police officers involved in Gray's arrest and transportation are currently suspended pending the investigation. The report was released on the same day that a family member of one of the six officers involved in Gray's arrest spoke out to defend their loved one on CNN. Defending the cops: A relative of one of the six police officers currently suspended over Gray's arrest spoke with CNN on Wednesday . The family member, who chose to remain anonymous but appears to be female, said she was speaking out because she didn't think it was right that no one was standing up for the officers. She says her law enforcement relative, who she says is African American, believes Gray was injured before he was taken away in the police van on April 12. The relative also shot down allegations that the police officer behind the wheel of the van may have driven eratically on purpose to get back at an 'irate' Gray. She says that since paddy wagon drivers are called to the scene of arrests, the driver wouldn't have been emotionally involved with what happened when Gray was apprehended. While she believes that her relative is free from any blame, she added that she suspects the police department is hiding something and that there may be a few 'bad apples' amongst their ranks. 'Why can't they figure out whether this gentleman was injured when he was being chased? Or where he was injured? There are a million cameras everywhere.' The relative says her biggest fear is that all six officers will be punished for Gray's death, which she thinks only a few may have been directly responsible for. When asked how her relatives is doing, the woman responds: 'How would anybody be doing in a situation like this? In a situation where you got out there, you risk your life, you make a little bit of money and then something bad happens and nobody is standing behind you, such as the city that you served. 'How would anybody be doing when someone is dead? Just because they wear that uniform doesn't mean that they don't hurt or that they're not upset or that they don't blame themselves. 'They're human beings not machines.'", "reference": "The prisoner who rode in a police van with Freddie Gray on April 12 in Baltimore says Gray was trying to hurt himself .\nPrisoner's statement to investigators was part of an affidavit obtained Wednesday by the Washington Post .\nGray was arrested on April 12 for carrying a switchblade and transported to the hospital shortly after arriving at jail .\nHe died a week later from spinal injuries; how he received the fatal trauma is still under investigation .\nThe fellow prisoner's statement is the first detail released about what happened during the ride .\nReport was released as family member of one of the six suspended police officers came forward to defend the cop .\nThe anonymous relatives says she believes Gray was injured before he was put in the van, and that not all six officers are to blame ."}, "419": {"id": "121d2214c06d89f729138c36ab19175926f95bfb", "article": "Australia's most notorious serial killer could have been caught before he murdered seven backpackers, had the 'wrong man' not been sent to prison, a new investigation has claimed. Channel Seven's Sunday Night will tell the story of Ivan Milat's first violent crime and how he escaped police prosecution, before going on to butcher seven backpackers. The revelation includes first-hand evidence from Milat's older brother, Boris, into the killer's 'secret victim'. Scroll down for video . A new report claims Ivan Milat, Australia's most notorious serial killer, could have been caught before he murdered seven backpackers . Boris Milat shares a secret he has kept for 52 years, which details how Australia's bloodiest butcher was responsible for the shooting more than two decades before the first backpacker murder in 1989, according to the report. The program also puts Mr Milat face-to-face with the 'wrong man', who was jailed for the first crime his brother committed. 'Don't hold yourself responsible,' the man, who Channel Seven has not yet named, tells Mr Milat, as they shake hands. According to the timeline presented by the program and Mr Milat, his murderous brother would have been a 19-year-old when he claimed his first victim. Former Detective Paul Gordon tells the program the evidence uncovered is 'unbelievable' and 'incredible'. Boris Milat tells the program a secret about his brother he had kept for more than 52 years . Milat was later sentenced to life in prison, but if the 'wrong man' (right) had not been jailed for his first crime, Milat's victims could have been saved, the program claims . 'Don't hold yourself responsible,' the man imprisoned for Milat's first violent crime told the killer's brother, Boris . Milat, 70, was convicted of butchering seven young people between 1989 and 1992 and burying their bodies in the Belanglo State Forest in southern NSW. He has been locked up in Goulburn's Supermax jail for almost 20 years. The first two bodies of Milat\u2019s victims were discovered on September 19 and 20 1992, when two runners found a decaying corpse in the Belanglo State Forest. According to claims made by the program, Milat would have been about 19 when he claimed his first victim . The daughter of Milat's first victim (left) is told her father was shot by the serial killer. Former Detective Paul Gordon (right) tells the program the evidence uncovered is 'unbelievable' and 'incredible' The report claims Milat's seven victims could have been saved if he had been\u00a0been held accountable for this first chilling crime . Police later confirmed the bodies were of missing British backpackers Caroline Clarke and Joanne Walters. Walters had been stabbed 35 times and Clarke had been shot 10 times in the head. The grim finds were just the beginning of a long and extensive search which resulted in the bodies of Australians Deborah Everist and James Gibson being found in October 1993, followed by Simone Schmidl\u2019s stabbed body in November of the same year. The decapitated body of German backpacker Anja Habschied was then found along with her boyfriend Gabor Neugebauer on 3 November 1993 in shallow graves 50 metres apart. British backpacker Caroline Clarke had been shot 10 times in the head when police found her body . First victims: Australians James Gibson and Deborah Everist, both aged 19, were Ivan Milat's first known victims after they disappeared in December 1989 and their bodies were found in the Belanglo State forest almost four years later . Simone Schmidl's body was found in November 1993. She had been stabbed to death . Milat was convicted of the seven backpacker murders on July 27, 1996 and for the attempted murder, false imprisonment and robbery of Paul Onions. He kept the shirts, sleeping bags, a water bottle, portable stove and backpacks of his victims hidden in roof and wall cavities, in what was described as an 'Aladdin's Cave', in the house he was arrested in 20 years ago. Boyfriend and girlfriend German backpackers Gabor Neugebauer and Anja Habschied were found dead on 3 November 1993 in shallow graves 50 metres apart . British backpacker Joanne Walters, is another one of the victims of backpacker murderer Ivan Milat . Sinister souvenir: In this photograph police seized from the house of Ivan Milat's brother William, the serial killer is seen carrying the sleeping bag which belonged to Deborah Everist who with boyfriend Jame Gibson was the first of Milat's victims killed in the Belanglo State Forest . The evil killer has penned a series of rambling letters while behind bars, according to a book released by his eldest nephew, Alistair Shipsey. The Milat Letters, is a compilation of\u00a094 notes from Milat to his eldest nephew Alistair Shipsey. Milat is serving seven consecutive life sentences for the murders of seven backpackers in  NSW between 1989 and 1992. In the letters, he tells Shipsey about his 'fair share' of 'sheilas', who write 'some frightening things' - and one woman who has even proposed. Australia's worst serial killer Ivan Milat kept trophies to remind him of each murder . Milat butchered and buried the bodies of seven young people between 1989 and 1992 in the Belanglo State Forest in southern NSW . 'Every month someone new writes; the latest one was from Texas. She tells me she\u2019s 25, white. I ought to ask her \u201cwhy\u201d as she only knows me from a website, and there\u2019s nothing nice about me on it,' one of the letters reads. 'As you know there are a lot of wackos out there as well. A lot of them write to me at times. I tell you Al, there are some real crazy people out and about.' Milat has been a troublesome inmate during his time in prison, and it is believed he planned at least one escape and swallowed metal objects in an attempt to get out of jail. An extract from one of the letters from Milat, written before he chopped his own finger off with a plastic knife in January 2009, affectionately refers to Shipsey as 'Al . In prison, Milat, has been a troublesome inmate, having planned at least one escape, swallowing metal objects and cutting off his own finger to send to the High Court in an envelope .

But one mother-to-be  had to give up much more than that for the sake of her unborn daughter. Lynn, from Chippenham, had to stop taking medication that enables her to move without pain as she suffers from a painful and crippling condition callled hip displasia. Lynn and husband Liam tried for a baby for three years so when she fell pregnant, she didn't want to take any risks so stopped taking pain relief for her\u00a0scoliosis and hip dysplasia symptoms . The condition means the ball and socket joint of her hip has not formed properly, which causes pain when she moves. She also has\u00a0scoliosis (curvature of the spine). Due to her disabilities, Lynn has to walk with a crutch around the home and uses a wheelchair when out and about. She also needs to take painkillers to give her some respite from the daily discomfort. But after becoming pregnant with a baby girl after three years of trying to conceive with husband, Liam, Lynn chose to stop taking the drugs for the time she carried their baby. She made the brave decision even though the weight of her baby bump put extra strain on her joints. 'I decided I would stop taking my painkillers when pregnant as there wasn't 100 per cent proof it would all be okay for baby so I stopped to be on the safe side,' she explained on My Extraordinary Pregnancy, which airs tonight on TLC. Lynn explains when pregnant that she's prepared to forgo pain relief for the sake of her baby . Healthy Libby was then delivered via\u00a0caesarean section but Lynn had hoped for a natural birth . 'She's so special and it took such a long time to get her, I don't want to do anything to risk the pregnancy.' Husband Liam, an IT consultant, said he understood Lynn's decision but he said he found it hard to see her suffering. 'She wants to be a normal mother and do everything normally but because of her condition she's not always able to,' he said. 'My admiration for her has grown, the pain she goes through daily has increased and got worse every day. Coping with that without pain killers is a big thing.' 'The pain she's going through on a daily basis has increased.' Lynn, who has only 30 per cent mobility with her hips, said her problems began when she was a small child. 'The pain started when I was quite young and I had the first surgery when I was five. 'Growing up I had a lot of hip pain and back pain and initially I didn't know what it was. As a teenager I had to wear a body brace which was difficult.' Her mother Jennifer said: 'As a child she would never show when things hurt. You'd ask how she was feeling and she'd say \"I'm fine\", she would always cover everything up and tell you what you wanted to hear to make you feel better.' Lynn's condition was diagnosed as a teenager and she has always been determined not to let her disability get in the way of her living a 'normal' life. She works as an occupational therapist for the NHS, plays wheelchair tennis and wanted to be able to deliver her baby naturally despite her hip problems. Despite her hip problems, Lynn, pictured in hospital with Liam and Libby after her birth, had wanted a natural delivery but had to have a c-section as Libby was breeched . Adjusting to life as a mother with limited mobility means Lynn has had a chairlift installed in her home . The new mother is determined not to let her disabilities get in her way . However, this was not possible in the end as her baby was in the breech position so she had to have her daughter, Libby, via a caesarean section. Lynn said afterwards: 'It's been a hard journey but well worth it.' Following the birth. Lynn has to allow changes she's always resisted - such as having a chairlift installed in their home - to take place so she can better care for Libby with her physical limitations. Lynn admits she's always tried to do things for herself but she admits as a new mother, she has to accept more help for the sake of her daughter. Following the safe arrival of Libby, the couple had an anxious six week wait to find out if she also has hip dysplasia as there is thought to be genetic link. Those with hip dysplasia are five to ten times times more likely to have baby with condition and it's more common in female and first-born babies. Lynn and Liam return to hospital six weeks after Libby's birth to hear the good news that she doesn't also have\u00a0hip dysplasia as there is a genetic link . The couple were delighted when a scan revealed Libby does not have the condition. However, if she did, the fact it had been detected early would mean doctors would be able to help her. This was something Lynn was keen to pursue as her own late diagnosis contributed to the mobility problems she has now. 'I'm so pleased she doesn't have to go through any of it,' she said after hearing Libby's six week scan gave her the all clear. 'If I have any doubts in my mind or as she's growing up I will push for her to be checked again.'

At the hearing, the judge granted Robert Bates permission to go to the Bahamas for a family vacation. That decision prompted a response from the family of Eric Harris, the man Bates killed. \"We are not surprised that Mr. Bates pled not guilty.  We are, however, surprised that Mr. Bates would choose to go on a vacation to the Bahamas during this tumultuous time.  Whether intended or not, Mr. Bates' vacationing in the Bahamas at this time sends a message of apathy with respect to the shooting and Eric's life.  At a time when we are still mourning the death of a loved one that he shot down in the street, Mr. Bates will be relaxing and enjoying his wealth and privilege.\" Bates' preliminary hearing is scheduled for 10 a.m. July 2. \"This will give us an opportunity to deal with the facts in the courtroom instead of the media and we're looking very much forward to that,\" said  Clark Brewster, one of his lawyers, after the hearing. Bates, 73, was working as a reserve deputy for the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office on April 2 when he was involved the arrest of Eric Harris in a weapons sting operation. Bates claims he meant to stun Harris with a Taser after Harris fled from officers, but mistakenly shot Harris with a gun instead. Bates has said the shooting was accidental. He has apologized to the Harris family, as has Sheriff Stanley Glanz. The lawyer for the family of the man who was killed claims that Bates wasn't qualified to be on the force, but received preferential treatment because he'd made donations to the agency and was a friend of the sheriff. The Tulsa World newspaper reported some supervisors in the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office were told to forge Bates' records and were reassigned when they refused. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office has denied these allegations. Over the weekend, one of Bates' lawyers released most of his training documents and said they prove Bates had proper law enforcement training.

Julie Stauch and married couple Sean Bagniewski and Vidhya Reddy all appear in on the video announcing Clinton's 2016 bid. They are part of a diverse group of people - from young mothers and people preparing for retirement, to Spanish-speaking brothers preparing to start a business and an Asian-American college graduate looking for her first job - chosen to show aspirational citizens as Clinton looks to speak to to wide demographic of voters. 'Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion,' Clinton says on the video. 'So I'm hitting the road to earn your vote.' But far from being 'everyday Americans', as the two minute video claims, Stauch and Bagniewski are directly involved with the Democrat party - just like campaigners Jared Milrad and Nate Johnson, from Chicago, Illinois, who discuss their upcoming wedding plans on screen. Scroll down for video . Sean Bagniewski and Vidhya Reddy appear discussing their plans for 2015 on Cinton's video announcing she is running for president - the Secretary of State's 'plan' for this year . But it has been revealed Bagniewski, who has previously run as for Des Moines City Council, was a campaigner for Clinton in 2007. Bagniewski, who lost  in 2013, is also said to be in talks with\u00a0Martin O\u2019Malley\u2019s people and may support him . Lawyers Bagniewski and Reddy are shown in their home in Des Moines, Iowa, discussing their plans for 2015. 'We've been doing a lot of home renovations,' Reddy tells the cameraman. But then Bagniewski chimes in: 'But most importantly, we really just want to teach our dog to stop eating the trash.' 'And so we have high hopes for 2015, that that is going to happen,' she laughs. However, their plans for this year may not involve actually supporting Clinton's White House bid. A source has told the DailyMail.com Bagniewski, who ran for Des Moines City Council in 2013, losing by 270 votes, is in talks with\u00a0Martin O\u2019Malley\u2019s people and may support him. Indeed, Bagniewski revealed to the Des Moines Register that he had been hosting an event for O'Malley last Thursday. O'Malley, who has just completed two terms as Maryland governor, is said to be considering running for president himself. The Democrat, 52, is expected to declare in May, but is keeping relatively tight-lipped about his intentions. 'My wife and I will make a decision on that when the time is right,' O'Malley told the Baltimore Sun\u00a0earlier this year. But it seems Clinton's campaign team can breathe a sigh of relief: Bagniewski went on to tell the Register: 'O'Malley's great - but for me, Hillary Clinton is just head and shoulders above all the competition.' Julie Stauch is another person who appears on the video with strong links to the Democrat party . Stauch, an Iowa resident, is the former state senate campaign manager for Democrat Wendy Davis . Meanwhile Stauch, who is filmed in her West Des Moines garden, is a former state senate campaign manager for Democrat Wendy Davis, who unsuccessfully ran to be governor of Texas in 2014. Davis is best-known for he 11-hour filibuster to block a bill which would have meant the closure of almost every abortion clinic in the state. Stauch has worked in a PR office for Planned Parenthood, and a LinkedIn profile now shows her as the group\u2019s top lobbyist in Iowa. However, in the video she is a woman famed for the produce gleaned from her Iowa garden. 'It's spring, and we are starting to get the garden ready - and my tomatoes are legendary in my own neighborhood,' she said. Jared Milrad (pictured right) and fianc\u00e9 Nate Johnson have also been revealed as campaigning Democrats . The couple, who are planning a summer wedding, were featured walking hand in hand during Clinton's video . The video, which has had 3,477,630 on YouTube since its launch on Sunday, has quickly become one of the most viewed political broadcasts of the year - a fact which will no doubt help Clinton as she begins meeting people in Iowa today. Featuring snappy music, and showing Clinton for less than half the running time, it is a dramatic departure from the campaign launch of seven years ago, which showed the Secretary of State\u00a0on a couch, talking about ending the Iraq war, shrinking deficits and expanding affordable health care. The 2015 video has managed to strike a chord with a range of people, with Democrat campaigners Milrad and Johnson talking about their up-coming nuptials capturing people's imagination. Milrad's voice is heard in a voiceover saying: 'I\u2019m getting married this summer to someone I really care about.' Milrad, who did not know they would be on the video, said he was overjoyed to be part of the Clinton rollout - and part of a large-scale change in U.S. social attitudes. 'It shows how far we've come,' said Milrad, 31-year-old lawyer and social activist, pleased that public support for same-sex marriage rights has grown so far as to appear in a presidential campaign launch.

The couple will get married in July in a Chicago park bordering Lake Michigan then have their reception at a LGBT community center, The Washington Blade\u00a0reported.

Dr. Anthony Moschetto, 54, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to criminal solicitation, conspiracy, burglary, arson, criminal prescription sale and weapons charges in connection to what prosecutors called a plot to take out a rival doctor on Long Island. He was released after posting $2 million bond and surrendering his passport. Two other men -- identified as James Chmela, 43, and James Kalamaras, 41 -- were named as accomplices, according to prosecutors. They pleaded not guilty in Nassau County District Court, according to authorities. Both were released on bail. Requests for comment from attorneys representing Moschetto and Chmela were not returned.  It's unclear whether Kalamaras has retained an attorney. Moschetto's attorney, Randy Zelin, said Wednesday that his client \"will be defending himself vigorously,\" the New York Post reported. \"Doctors are supposed to ensure the health and wellbeing of people, but Dr. Moschetto is alleged to have replaced that responsibility with brazen, callous and criminal acts,\" Acting Nassau District Attorney Madeline Singas said in a statement. Police officers allegedly discovered approximately 100 weapons at Moschetto's home, including hand grenades, high-capacity magazines and knives. Many of the weapons were found in a hidden room behind a switch-activated bookshelf, according to prosecutors. The investigation began back in December, when undercover officers began buying heroin and oxycodone pills from Moschetto in what was initially a routine investigation into the sale of prescription drugs, officials said. During the course of the undercover operation, however, Moschetto also sold the officers two semiautomatic assault weapons as well as ammunition, prosecutors said. Moschetto allegedly told officers during one buy that he needed dynamite to \"blow up a building.\" He later said he no longer needed the dynamite because a friend was setting fire to the building instead. Kalamaras and Chmela are believed to have taken part in the arson, according to prosecutors. \"The fire damaged but did not destroy the office of another cardiologist whose relationship with Dr. Moschetto had soured due to a professional dispute,\" according to the statement from the district attorney's office. Moschetto allegedly gave an informant and undercover detective blank prescriptions and cash for the assault and killing of the fellow cardiologist, according to prosecutors. He also requested that the rival's wife be assaulted if she happened to be present, authorities said. \"He was willing to pay $5,000 to have him beaten and put in a hospital for a few months, and then he said he would pay $20,000 to have him killed,\" said Assistant District Attorney Anne Donnelly, reported CNN affiliate WCBS.

Some would quibble with the second part of that statement, but Mourinho says that too will change. If the first 699 games under Russian rule has established Chelsea at the top of English and European football, Mourinho believes the next 700 will see them supply more players for the English national team as they implement Abramovich\u2019s demand to follow Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. Sunday's trip to Loftus Road marks Chelsea\u2019s 700th game under the ownership of Roman Abramovich . Abramovich (right) celebrates with Frank Lampard (centre) and John Terry after Chelsea clinch their first Premier League title under his ownership in 2005 . The Russian finally got his hands on the Champions League trophy following Chelsea's success in 2012 . Mourinho also believes Chelsea\u2019s adherence to FFP \u2014 \u2018compared with other clubs and owners who didn\u2019t want to play under the rules\u2019, he pointed out in a thinly veiled dig at Manchester City \u2014 positions them as standard bearers for the English game. There can certainly be no doubt Chelsea are in a far stronger position than when Abramovich bought the club from Ken Bates for \u00a3140m on June 1, 2003. In the intervening 12 years he has spent in the region of \u00a3842.9m on transfer fees, winning three Premier Leagues, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one Europa League and one Champions League, but now, Mourinho says, Abramovich\u2019s rule will benefit England as well as Chelsea. Jose Mourinho, seen here with Abramovich in 2004, has\u00a0has been in charge of Chelsea for almost five of the Russian's 12 seasons at Stamford Bridge . The Blues have won three Premier Leagues, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one Europa League and one Champions League since 2004 . \u2018He has been good for Chelsea, good for English football, good for European football,\u2019 said Mourinho, who has been in charge for almost five of those 12 seasons. \u2018Chelsea after him became strong, a top club in the country and a top club in Europe. I think that\u2019s very, very good. I think it\u2019s important and I think it\u2019s also important the message Mr Abramovich and this club are passing now. \u2018The decision to accept the [Financial Fair Play] rules and play under the rules I think is a big decision compared with other clubs and other owners that didn\u2019t accept the rules and didn\u2019t want to play under the rules. Chelsea are in a far stronger position than when Abramovich bought the club from Ken Bates in 2003 . \u2018Will the next 700 games under him be good for the English national side? I believe so. In the first team, we had some important players in the national team. 'John Terry, Ashley Cole, Joe Cole, Frank Lampard, Wayne Bridge, Shaun Wright-Phillips. We had a nucleus of four, five players that were always in the national team. \u2018Now we are going through a period where it\u2019s just about Gary Cahill. But we have some young boys coming into the first-team. Ruben [Loftus-Cheek] is already here. Normally, in a few years they should be there [in the national side].\u2019 Gary Cahill (above) is now Chelsea's only senior England international in the current first team squad . Mourinho believes the likes of Ruben Loftus-Cheek (left) and Dominic Solanke will represent Chelsea and England for years to come . Mourinho did not name them, but Dominic Solanke, Patrick Bamford, Lewis Baker and Isaiah Brown are thought to be highly-rated at Chelsea, who supply many of the players in England\u2019s age-group teams. The question is whether their young English players will be given the chance in the first team at a club who can take a huge step towards the title by winning at QPR today. It is a game Chelsea go into mindful of decisive slips in last season\u2019s title race but with the title firmly in their own hands now, Mourinho is confident no mistakes will be made. Chelsea are on the verge of a domestic double after picking up the Capital One Cup in March . Mourinho has won seven major trophies while in charge of the west London club . He added: \u2018Don\u2019t make me remember the game against Sunderland because that was the game which stopped us fighting for the title. I don\u2019t want to speak again about that game. \u2018Last season we were depending on others. We needed this team to lose a couple of points here, a couple of points there. This situation is different. \u2018Now we are in a position where we can be isolated of everything. We don\u2019t have to be watching Man City against Man United.

Ariana Mason, 21, claims she was also choked by the man when he put her in a 'stranglehold' at a Las Vegas hotel. After filing a civil rights lawsuit against Officer Shawn Izzo and the Metropolitan Police Department,, she told reporters yesterday: 'What happened to me was wrong and I don't want it to happen to anybody else.' Scroll down for video . Tearful: Ariana Mason, 21, relives her ordeal to reporters yesterday. Scars said to be from the attack on her by a police officer last summer can be seen on her chin. Two of her teeth were also broken, she says . Ariana was flanked by her parents, Fred and Francina Mason of Teaneck, New Jersey, plus an aunt from Los Angeles - TV personality Rolonda Watts - and her lawyer Brent Bryson as she relived her ordeal. It was caught on CCTV cameras at The Mirage hotel casino on Las Vegas's strip. According to Ariana's lawsuit, she was subjected to excessive force at the hotel while she was being arrested shortly before 3am on August 16 last year. The lawsuit also noted that Ariana is African-American and Izzo is white. Ariana, who cried while talking to reporters yesterday, told them: 'I just feel as if the color of my skin was different, this wouldn't have happened to me.' Sombre: Ariana looks on as her lawyer holds up a photograph from last August of her battered face . Lawyer Brent Bryson said his young client had 26 stitches after her face was rammed into a glass table-top . Ariana Mason's aunt is Rolonda Watts, the television and radio talk show host. She is best known for hosting the eponymous Rolonda, an internationally syndicated talk show which aired from 1994 to 1997 . With scars clearly visible on her chin, she recalled how she had been at an event at The Mirage's 1 Oak nightclub \u2013 where her boyfriend 'DJ Tech' was performing. After his set, several people left the club to take pictures in front of the event's signage, according to Ariana's account. But during the photo session, a scuffle broke out 'between people associated with the event and security officers'. Ariana, who was wearing a black dress at the time, claims one of her girlfriends was 'attacked' by a woman security officer. Ariana said she grabbed the woman's jacket to move her away. But then Ariana herself was 'attacked' by Officer Izzo, who approached her from behind. Without warning, she says, he pulled her away and wrapped his forearm around her throat. In the hotel's CCTV footage, Ariana can be seen being restrained by a police officer, said to be Shawn Izzo . Another camera shows the officer putting Ariana in a chokehold and dragging her across the floor . The young fashion designer said she 'became extremely anxious' and struggled to breathe during the 'attack' 'He then threw Ariana to the ground and maintained Ariana in a choke hold and actually drug Ariana by the neck across the floor outside of 1 Oak for several feet,' claims the lawsuit. The young woman, it says, 'became extremely anxious' as she struggled to breathe. After she broke free from his grip, she punched him. She said she had no idea he was a police officer because he hadn't identified himself to her. 'When he came behind me I didn't know who was attacking me from behind, and all I did was try to defend myself,' she added. 'I feel as if the way he reacted was completely unnecessary, and it shouldn't have happened like that. 'He should have had more control under the situation, instead of escalating it and making it ten times worse.' After breaking free from his grip she punched him (left) - but says she had no idea he was a police officer . Ariana's legs are seen around the officer's hips in the right of this video still as her face is pressed against the glass-topped table - upon which rests a giant vase of pink and yellow flowers . In the CCTV footage obtained by Ariana's lawyer, Officer Izzo and others are seen handcuffing her hands behind her back and leading her to a round, marble table with a glass top. She is made to bend over it, and her face is pushed against it several times by a man standing between her outstretched legs. At one point her legs end up around his waist while her head is pressed on the table. Her face was rammed so hard on to the glass that it shattered - and shards embedded in her chin. Two of her teeth were broken, too. A photo of her injuries was shown to reporters by Mr Bryson yesterday. He said his client had needed several operations to repair her face. He added: 'Once Ariana was handcuffed with her hands behind her back, she was not a threat.' Ariana cried throughout yesterday's appearance. She claims the color of her skin was a factor in the incident . Ariana had been charged with battery on a protected person but prosecutors dismissed the case last month. She filed an internal affairs complaint but police ratified Izzo's conduct. Records show that Ariana was one of two people arrested on felony battery on a police officer charges in the incident. Six others were arrested on misdemeanor charges. She admitted she was 20 at the time but said she had 'only two drinks' during the night out. She added that she hadn't been asked for ID when she arrived at the nightclub with her boyfriend. The club's operator has yet to comment.

Islamic teachings traditionally state that followers should use water to clean themselves  after going to the toilet. A new Islamic fatwa in Turkey has decreed that Muslims are allowed to use toilet paper . The set of rules for how Muslims should relieve themselves, called the Qadaa al-Haajah, was established in the times before toilet paper or toilet seats were invented. Use of the left hand or three stones was also permissible. The code also states that followers should not speak or read while on the toilet and should enter with their left foot and leave with their right, speaking a prayer. The Directorate of Religious Affairs for Turkey stated that the use of the material for hygiene is acceptable but water was preferable . Men and women are also told not to stand while relieving themselves but to squat or sit. The new announcement, reported by Hurriyet Daily News, stated:\u00a0'If water cannot be found for cleansing, other cleaning materials can be used.' 'Even though some sources deem paper to be unsuitable as a cleaning material, as it is an apparatus for writing, there is no problem in using toilet paper. Last month the\u00a0Directorate of Religious Affairs had also relaxed rules on around the use of products containing alcohol - as long as they were not consumed. Hand sanitizes and other similar products used for hygiene products are now halal.

Steelcase's the Brody WorkLounge is an effort to preserve the privacy and less distractions given in a cubicle while still being a part of an open office work community. On its company website, Steelcase said the Brody is designed to be 'good for your body and good for your brain'. Scroll down for video . Office furniture company Steelcase designed the work space seating to provide privacy in an open office setting (above designs of the Brody WorkLounge) The seating will be available for purchase in late August starting at $2,700 . Brody features an LED task light, privacy screen, foot rest, storage space and personal adjustable work surface . The Brody, which will be available\u00a0late August starting at $2,700, sort of resembles both a desk and an office and is created to limit distractions by creating a shelter while also providing privacy, according to the company. The Cognitive Neuroscience Karolinska Institute in Sweden's work on flow - a passing state of deep concentration where workers are their most productive - informed the design of Brody, according to\u00a0CityLab. 'We had kind of an intuitive understanding of how people liked to study,' Mark McKenna, director of product design at Steelcase\u00a0told Fast Company. 'As the project developed, and as we started diving into what it means to focus and why someone would want to escape, these new findings really helped guide the project.' 'The Brody WorkLounge creates a shelter from visual distractions, provides privacy and provides an enhanced sense of psychological security,' the company said on its website . The design for Brody is based on\u00a0The Cognitive Neuroscience Karolinska Institute in Sweden's work on flow - a passing state of deep concentration where workers are their most productive . In the U.S., 70 per cent of offices have low or no partitions as they embrace open office plans . Each WorkLounge features a mini LED task light, a power outlet, personal work surface that adjusts up to a 40 degree pitch, a privacy screen, a side surface which also serves as an armrest, patented LiveLumbar technology which gives back support, personal storage off of the floor, a foot rest, and a cushion that adapts to each person's size. 'The ability to focus is a real challenge for today's workers and students,' the company said on its website. 'We get interrupted or distracted every 11 minutes and it takes over 23 minutes to get back on task. 'The Brody WorkLounge creates a shelter from visual distractions, provides privacy and provides an enhanced sense of psychological security.' By transforming the under-utilized in-between spaces into these modern alternative to enclaves, where workers can get away for a couple of hours, Steelcase claims its design will help organizations and universities by delivering a 'high-performance work space'. A study revealed that a sense of privacy boosts performance, and Brody WorkLounge strives to provide workers with limited visual distractions . Mark McKenna, director of product design at Steelcase said: 'I think it's clear that people in an office need a place to focus. But the bench is here to stay. It's conducive to collaboration' In recent years, many companies have embraced open offices with about 70 per cent of U.S. offices having no or low partitions, according to the International Facility Management Association. However, a 2013 study revealed that workers are frustrated by the distractions in open offices which lead to poorer work performance, according to the Washington Post. That study also found that nearly half of the surveyed workers in open offices said the lack of sound privacy proved to be a problem for them while more than 30 per cent complained about the lack of visual privacy. Another study\u00a0revealed that having a sense of privacy actually boosts performance.

He tweeted  the former Dancing With The Stars contestant on Monday saying: 'lol wassup with your boyfriend.' Revenge: Former Ole Miss star Marshall Henderson jumped on the revelations Jarret Stoll (right) was arrested in a drugs bust last week by tweeting to Erin Andrews: 'lol wassup with your boyfriend.' He was suspended in 2013 for allegedly failing a drugs test. Andrews responded to the news then by saying: 'He mocking anyone now?' She was referencing his reputation of being a hothead and badmouthing other players. Henderson responded with the message: 'ima save that and you will be the first person ill mock.' He has waited two years to get his revenge. On Monday TMZ sports reported that the athlete was trying to smuggle over three grams of cocaine and over eight grams of MDMA by hiding them in his board shorts. Stoll was previously in the news for non-sports related reasons back in 2013 when he was rushed to the hospital after having a seizure at his home in Hermosa Beach, California during the offseason, with the Kings later saying they did not know what caused the incident. His reaction came two years after the TV reporter said: 'He mocking anyone now?' after he was suspended for failing a drugs test. He warned the ex-Dancing With The Stars contestant she was in the firing line . After learning of Stoll's arrest, he posted this on Twitter to Andrews - getting his revenge two years on . Stoll, who will make a cameo in the upcoming film version of the popular HBO show Entourage, was booked into the Clark County Detention Center and was listed as having a hearing on Saturday after posting $5,000 bail. The charges include possession of Class 1, 2, 3 and 4 controlled substances, including cocaine and ecstasy. Michael Pariente, a Las Vegas criminal defense lawyer, says that Stoll will likely be offered a plea deal as a first time offender. Speaking with TSN, he said; 'It's pretty much a slap on the wrist. Even if he was going to represent himself they'd make him an offer like this.' This would include a $1,000 fee, an online drug awareness course, and possibly community service. Henderson is currently playing in Baghdad in the Iraqi Super League. His history with cocaine and marijuana use led to him being undrafted by the NBA in 2014.

In fairness to Pochettino, this would not have been in his thinking when he selected Kane as captain for this contest and he was honest enough to admit afterwards that securing a top-four place would now be difficult. But the post-match autopsy was relatively painless because there was more interest in discussing the continuing rise of the 21-year-old striker rather than the thoroughly unremarkable performance Kane and his colleagues had just produced. Seemingly miffed by the line of questioning, Pochettino\u2019s only explanation for why he made Kane the youngest skipper in the Barclays Premier League this season was brief and to the point. \u2018He deserved it,\u2019 he said, and with so many senior players missing it was not entirely without logic when he is said to be one of the more vocal members of the dressing room. But Pochettino did not stop there, accepting the invitation to gaze briefly into the future and imagine Kane as club captain. \u2018He has the quality,\u2019 he said. \u2018So yes, maybe (he could be captain in the long term).\u2019 Right now anything would appear possible with this kid. The goal only 78 seconds into his England debut; the fact that he is just one short of becoming the first Tottenham striker since Gary Lineker to score 30 in a season. Perhaps he will be hosting Match of the Day next week. Here at Turf Moor, though, the dream and the reality were not quite in tandem for once, Kane enduring one of the more difficult afternoons he has experienced this season alongside team-mates unable to provide him with the service he requires. \u2018It was difficult for him and difficult for his team-mates too,\u2019 Pochettino acknowledged. He also pointed to Manchester City\u2019s recent defeat here and complained that \u2018long balls into the box\u2019 made Sean Dyche\u2019s side hard to play against. But Tottenham played like a side that took one look at Arsenal\u2019s thumping defeat of Liverpool on Saturday and concluded that a place in the Champions League was already beyond their reach. They lacked urgency as well as energy, and while Pochettino could point to illness, injury and the international commitments of his players it remained a disappointing display. \u2018Maybe we like playing on Thursday nights??\u2019 tweeted Darren Anderton.

Tottenham had only two shots on target in this game \u2014 they have only managed fewer three times in Premier League games this season. It remained more than a little perplexing that Pochettino waited until the 83rd minute to unleash Andros Townsend from the bench. The scorer of England\u2019s equaliser against Italy and probably full of confidence as a result, he might have injected some much-needed momentum into Tottenham\u2019s football. As it was he once again found himself the target of Paul Merson\u2019s venom, the former Arsenal midfielder teasing him on Twitter that he must have missed the bus. Dyche focused more on the positives of his own team\u2019s efforts but should really see this as a missed opportunity, given how poor Tottenham were. A point would have been welcome but three would have lifted them out of the relegation places, and on reflection his side had the best of the chances. Danny Ings squandered a marvellous opportunity in the opening few minutes before forcing a fine one-handed save from Michel Vorm shortly before the interval. The fact that the first booking came in the 78th minute illustrated how timid a contest this was. Even after Dyche had taken the fairly bold step of starting with Ings, Sam Vokes and Ashley Barnes. This game boasted the two hardest working players in the Premier League this season, with George Boyd top of that list with 338.8km covered and Christian Eriksen second, just 600m behind the Burnley midfielder.

It was Boyd\u2019s industry that created the first decent chance of the game, the pressure he applied on Ryan Mason forcing the newly capped England player into directing a back-pass into the path of Ings. The Burnley striker should have scored but succeeded only in firing his shot straight at Vorm. The second half was no better. Eriksen burst clear only to send a shot well over the crossbar, while Barnes threatened too. Paulinho found himself clean through at one stage only to scuff his effort embarrassingly wide. And the irrepressible Boyd would go close moments before the final whistle only to see his header bounce agonisingly wide. \u2018I think we edged the game,\u2019 said Dyche afterwards. \u2018Danny (Ings) has had a couple of great chances but the first one he\u2019s probably just hit too cleanly. But I\u2019m pleased by the fact that we\u2019ve got another clean sheet against a team that has spent a couple of hundred million on players.\u2019 Not that there was much evidence of that here.

The firm's latest update automatically shows the latest pictures posted to Facebook's site. Tinder also said it had improved its mutual friends feature. Scroll down for video . Tinder will now display the last 34 pictures of a person's Instagram feed - and allow users to see more. Simply open Tinder, go to your new profile, and connect it to your Instagram account with a single tap - your Tinder profile will automatically start displaying your recent Instagram photos. Tinder only displays the last 34 photos, users can venture out to the app for a look at the full library. 'You asked, we listened,' the firm said. 'We\u2019ve made some exciting new changes to your Tinder profile including a slick, new Instagram integration and more common friends.' The firm said it made the changes after noticing many users put their Instagram user name in their profile. 'Now there\u2019s no need to put your Instagram handle in your profile description to tell your story (we got sick of having to do that, too).' It also stressed that the app would not let other visitors to your Instagram feed know it was part of a dating profile. 'And in case you were wondering, Tinder won\u2019t post anything to Instagram on your behalf or alter your existing Instagram privacy settings.' Tinder has overhauled its profile as part of the Instagram integration - and now shows friends of friends as well as more interests . The firm has also used Facebook to boost its 'mutual friends' feature. Tinder now shows you the mutual friends and friends of friends you have in common with your potential matches. 'This adds more context and an extra degree of connection to every swipe,' Tinder claims. It is also preparing an overhaul of the way profiles look, expanding the number of interests people can add. Earlier this month Tinder rolled out \u2018Tinder Plus\u2019, a premium service allowing people to \u2018undo\u2019 a like or change their location. A study has found that nearly two thirds of dating app users are men - and one in five will pay for premium services. Sixteen to 34 year-olds make up the majority of mobile dating app users, accounting for 70 per cent of the total user base. The study, carried out by London-based research firm GlobalWebIndex, also found that six per cent of web users currently use a location-based dating app. Significantly, just a fifth of dating app users are paying for an online dating service,' co-authors Jason Mander and Felim McGrath said in the report. But now they have set a limit on the number of \u2018likes\u2019 a user can perform in one day - which seems to be set at 100. When a user reaches this limit, the app tells them \u2018You\u2019re Out of Likes\u2019, and gives a countdown clock until 24 hours are up so they can start swiping again. But, below this clock, a big red button says \u2018Get Unlimited Likes with Tinder Plus\u2019. A price is then shown. But different users are reporting the app is asking for different amounts. It seems the prices range from around \u00a31.49 a month to as high as \u00a314.99 - but the reasons why are not clear. This means some users will pay \u00a317.88 a year for Tinder Plus - but others, in the upper price category, will have to fork out a whopping \u00a3179.88 a year. This equates to some users inadvertently paying \u00a3162 more than others over the course of a year. Speaking to MailOnline, Rosette Pambakian, Vice President of Communications and Branding at Tinder, told MailOnline the app is testing out different price points ahead of a global release. 'We are testing Tinder Plus in select markets at various price points before rolling it out globally,' she said. 'The UK is one of our test markets, so a certain portion of the population was given access to Tinder Plus at varying price points.' However, it is still not clear how the app decides how much to charge a user - and whether it is based on location or activity. In addition, Tinder has not commented on whether a user will receive a refund if they ultimately paid over the odds for the final price of the service.", "reference": "Tinder only displays the last 34 photos - but users can easily see more .\nFirm also said it had improved its mutual friends feature ."}, "436": {"id": "a84944fed11b4eb6b4d1d8a44bc9ee44b2a0f2d0", "article": "(CNN)The powers of Marvel's all-star superheroes go a bit wobbly in \"Avengers: Age of Ultron.\" Faced with the daunting prospect of topping the surprise and excitement of 2012's The Avengers, the third highest-grossing film of all time, writer-director Joss Whedon mixes some brooding down-time in with the abundant spectacle. To be sure, series junkies will get their fix from the sheer massiveness of the exploits, but at least two of the big action scenes are lackluster, while the climax and resolution could have been worked out in more complex, less rote ways, so as to further increase intrigue and anticipation for \"Avengers: Infinity War Parts 1 and 2,\" already scheduled for release in May of 2018 and 2019, respectively. Not that any of this will matter much, since the pent-up excitement among the enormous international fan base is so intense that nothing will keep the summer's presumed biggest franchise blockbuster from soaring to and beyond the one-billion dollar threshold internationally. Hands-on producer Kevin Feige and his associates have built a cinematic empire quite unprecedented in Hollywood history, a veritable solar system of staggeringly profitable individual franchises unified by the overpowering collective force of the Avengers. So while sideline enterprises like the new \"Daredevil\" TV series continue to pop up, the company can be so confident in the enduring appeal of its theatrical mainstays that it recently published a release schedule for its remaining big-gun commercial titles from now through the end of the decade. At this point, no one would be willing to bet on when a sense of terminal deja vu might set in to bring it all to an end, and Comic-Con can plan its main events years ahead. In the meantime, the key points of interest surround how many surprises and twists can be wrung from a format and set of expectations that demand great fealty from core fans; any significant deviations are taken as personal betrayals by the hardest-core geeks. Last summer, \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" showed that Marvel could play it a bit more fast and loose than it generally does, but the big-name franchises still seem sacrosanct. And so it is with \"Avengers: Age of Ultron,\" which at moments takes a peek down some shadowy side roads but ends up mostly zooming along the main highway to deliver what the audience wants rather than something even a little bit different. Picking up where last year's \"Captain America: Winter Soldier\" left off, the new film, without preamble, dives right in to show the Avengers dispatching the remnants of the nasty HYDRA organization in a hectically and indifferently staged forest combat scene that leaves Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) worse for wear while also introducing two new adversaries, twins Pietro and Wanda (Aaron-Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen). Victory allows for some passably amusing scenes of the heroes blowing off steam: The favorite party trick of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is to challenge all comers to lift up his hammer; Natasha/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) pursue a little mating dance in which her amorous interest is predicated upon his retaining his human rather than superhero form; and Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) take stock of the advances their old Nazi nemesis Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann) appears to be making in the artificial intelligence department, specifically with the most sophisticated humanoid ever devised, Ultron (voiced with marvelous robotic nuance by James Spader). What's behind Warner Bros.' risky move to release nine movies . Ultron is a cool and sophisticated creation; what he lacks, of course, is a heart, which is what makes him such an imposing villain. A sleekly designed robot you might even call handsome, he makes an excellent intellectual and smart-ass sparring partner for Stark, but when he first appears, he's still on training wheels. However, he does recruit Pietro and Wanda to his cause, an easy matter since Stark killed their parents. He's not yet entirely ready to conquer the universe but, in their first skirmish with him, the Avengers are sufficiently outclassed to begin worrying. Could 'Star Wars' open at $500 million? Licking their wounds at the \"safe house\" of Hawkeye's farm, the Avengers go into a funk. The impatient Thor quickly takes off \"to find answers,\" Bruce resists Natasha's desire to get something physical cooking between them; Stark, lamenting that \"Ultron is tryng to tear us apart,\" consults with old cohort Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson, briefly), while Mad Men's Linda Cardellini, playing Hawkeye's stand-by-your-man wife, is stuck with the (intentionally?) funniest line of dialogue in the film: \"You know I totally support your avenging.\" While some of his partners wallow in disarray, Captain America heads for Seoul, where the next evolutionary step is to emerge via a device called \"the cradle,\" which will hatch mass-produced android soldiers that will pave the way for Ultron's world domination. But a major chase through the city involving a runaway subway train falls flat due to basic conceptual silliness and poor action continuity. Of course, the Avengers ultimately get it together to do the kind of butt-kicking they're supposed to do, and a very welcome addition to the team comes in the form of the android called Vision. Red-faced and green-garbed, Vision is given a striking profile and overall presence by Paul Bettany (heretofore limited in the Marvel world to vocal work as Stark's computerized butler J.A.R.V.I.S.), and it can be hoped, if not assumed, that this most intriguing character will play an even more important role in the final two Avengers installments. 'Galaxy Quest' TV series in the works . Ultimately, Whedon's efforts to invest the heroes with a degree of uncertainty and vulnerability comes off as half-baked, as such an effort can only go so far due to the nature of the material. After all, these are comic book characters defined by their double identities; a third dimension is neither required nor perhaps even desired. If ending on a dramatic cliffhanger note had been desired, the elements were there for the taking; including a semi-tragic component along with mystery about Ultron's ultimate fate would arguably have only further cranked up anticipation for the coming chapters. But, then, what does that matter when the automatic attendance of millions is assured? \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" succeeds in the top priority of creating a worthy opponent for its superheroes and giving the latter a few new things to do, but this time the action scenes don't always measure up and some of the characters are left in a kind of dramatic no-man's-land. The returning series actors acquit themselves in the expected agreeable manner, while series newcomer Andy Serkis has a terrific couple of minutes as a tough but stressed South African criminal. \u00a92015 The Hollywood Reporter.

The king is dead; long live the king. Long to reign over us. Or should that be rain over us? The heavy downpours that drenched Augusta on Tuesday would have been greeted by groans from soaked patrons and photographers hoping for snaps of glamourous WAGs. But Northern Ireland\u2019s world No 1 would be forgiven if he had grinned from ear to ear. That\u2019s because each of McIlroy\u2019s four major victories so far has come on courses which have been subjected to heavy rain at some point during the week. Wet conditions hand McIlroy a massive advantage: his huge hitting with sky-high ball flight means he can still fly his ball miles. Shorter hitters or those with low ball flight, meanwhile, will have no roll on the wet fairways and will be hitting their approach shots from miles back. Rory McIlroy shields himself from the rain on Tuesday - but a wet course will play into his hands . Augusta National looks at its finest in the sun, but the world No 1 has won all of his four majors after rain . And that is no good at Augusta, where precise approaches are vital to the most strategically demanding greens in major championship golf. Last year\u2019s trio of Fred Couples (66-1 for 20th), Miguel Angel Jimenez (150-1 for 4th) and Bernhard Langer (400-1 for 8th) will be tough to match that this time round, but here goes\u2026 . Patrick Reed (40-1) \u2013 Brash, proud of it and born to show off on the biggest stage. Only his second Masters but played Augusta National many times as a college student. Tiger Woods (45-1) \u2013 OK, so no-one knows which Woods will turn up, but this could be one of the all-time cheeky punts. Practice form and rededication to the game are promising signs. Paul Casey (70-1) \u2013 Back to near his best after finally getting fully fit and committing to play full time in the US. Fifth-best on the PGA Tour in par-five scoring \u2013 crucial at Augusta. Since the work done to \u2018Tiger-proof\u2019 the course in the noughties, the home of the year\u2019s first major has become a bomber\u2019s course. Bubba Watson, with two wins in three years, Adam Scott and Angel Cabrera are all big-hitting recent champions, but examine the list of leaderboards in recent years and you\u2019ll find them dominated by players whose favourite club in the bag is driver. Mother Nature looks set to smile on McIlroy again this week with heavy rain forecast, particularly on Friday and Saturday. If that happens, the number of players who can win reduces dramatically. Three-time champion Phil Mickelson (28-1) and England\u2019s former US Open winner Justin Rose (45-1) are tempting at their prices, but neither have hit their top form this year, so would be backed based on gut feeling rather than cold hard facts. The likes of Jordan Spieth (10-1), Zach Johnson (100-1), Ian Poulter (80-1) and Jamie Donaldson (125-1) have the brains and skill sets to get the job done. Woods (45-1) must be included in that group too, despite having no form, providing the chipping yips do not strike again. But they will all have to be at the very top of their games for the entire week to compete with the boom-boom brigade. Bubba Watson's power has taken him to two Masters victories, but his last title defence ended badly . Tiger Woods has the skill set to succeed for a fourth time at Augusta, but he must answer big questions . McIlroy (6-1) heads that pack, closely followed by Watson (11-1). Australia\u2019s Jason Day (14-1) and Adam Scott (20-1), and Sweden\u2019s Henrik Stenson (22-1) are joined by American gunslingers Dustin Johnson (16-1) and Jimmy Walker (22-1) as the big hitters who have shown best form so far this year. The Masters, played on the modern-day Augusta, is the one major of the year where a formula for a winner can be identified: long driving + strong early season form + course experience + the week of their lives = green jacket. Brooks Koepka (5-1)\u00a0\u2013 it\u2019s always tough to know how a player with no experience of Augusta will take to the place, but this monster-hitter looks to have the perfect game. The 24-year-old American globetrotter has won the Phoenix Open to the Turkish Airlines Open in the last six months. Scott, the 2011 champion, has made a late switch back to his long putter, which does not bode well. Stenson has been battling the flu, which either rules him out or makes him more dangerous, depending on whether you believe the old adage: \u2018beware the wounded golfer\u2019. But what makes Day, Johnson and Walker so appealing is that each has claimed at least one big win already this year on courses that favour big hitters. Day (Torrey Pines), Walker (Pebble Beach) and Johnson (Doral) have shown they possess the perfect mix of long driving, precise iron control and dead-eyed putting under the heat of competition. That is the perfect recipe for a Masters champion. Their only problem is that McIlroy has used it to taste success on four occasions in majors, and Watson two, while they are all still waiting to dine at the top table. Jason Day has a brilliant record at Augusta and the final step left for the Australian to take is victory . Dustin Johnson's colossal power means he has the weapon most needed to conquer Augusta . Jimmy Walker chips onto the second green during practice, and could be set for a big week . But the pressure is mounting on McIlroy as he bids for golfing immortality. Watson, meanwhile, could only finish 50th in defence of his title two years ago and could be rusty after a month off. And given he finished second on his Masters debut in 2011, third two years later and 10th 12 months ago despite battling a broken thumb, Sunday could be a perfect Day for Australia and the man who has long looked to be golf\u2019s next major champion.

Researchers have also revealed the material features increasingly young children. Nine out of every ten images of child sexual abuse found online in 2014 showed children aged ten and under, according to the Internet Watch Foundation. Overall, experts from the regulator removed more than 31,000 web pages featuring vile images of sexual abuse in 2014, soaring 136 per cent from around 13,000 the previous year . That was a dramatic increase from the year before, when around two-thirds of the child porn it found featured children of such a young age. They were part of a worrying rise in the amount of child abuse the IWF discovered online. Overall, experts from the regulator removed more than 31,000 web pages featuring vile images of sexual abuse in 2014, soaring 136 per cent from around 13,000 the previous year. The jump came after the internet watchdog was told that it could proactively seek out abusive content online, in order to shut it down. The IWF won the extra powers last year in the wake of the 2012 murders of Tia Sharp, 12, and April Jones, five \u2013 girls who were both killed by men who watched child porn online. Emma Hardy, the IWF's director of external relations, said: 'The biggest change for us last year was our ability to proactively search for child sexual abuse imagery. Our analysts are able to actively search for the content, rather than merely wait for reports to come in from the public. 'That's made a huge difference. Last year we were able to process 74,000 reports and identify just over 31,000 child sexual abuse web pages. 'I think there's still a huge amount out there. We've got a long way to go until we see the peak of this problem.' In its annual report, the IWF said it alerts law enforcement agencies and hotlines in other countries when it discovers foreign-based web pages with child sexual abuse images and 'repeatedly chases' them until they are removed. Kevin Bollaert, 28, was sentenced to 18 years after he was convicted in February of 21 counts of identity theft and six counts of extortion  for running websites that capitalised on the internet as a forum for public shaming . Most of the photographs and videos of sexual abuse that the IWF found online were on websites hosted in North America. Just 0.3 per cent of the images \u2013 just over 90 pictures or videos \u2013 appeared on web pages hosted in Britain, down from 18 per cent in 1996, when IWF was founded. But although more child porn is now being removed from the web, the shocking figures also highlight the massive scale of the problem online. Susie Hargreaves, chief executive of IWF, said technology companies were 'stepping up' efforts to tackle the amount of images of sexual abuse online. But she added that many of them were still too slow to take images down, or failed to acknowledge they have a problem. 'This year will ensure they have nowhere to hide as we will be targeting them for the benefit of all internet users and victims of sexual abuse,' she said. IWF is funded by 117 technology companies around the world, including Google, Facebook and Twitter. Criminals are using many legitimate websites to distribute pictures and videos of child sexual abuse imagery, the IWF said. In particular, they targeted websites which are specifically designed to allow users to upload pictures, and make them available via a unique web page address, or 'URL'. Nearly 20,000 of the web pages removed last year were hosted by these sorts of sites. \u00f7 Paedophiles are using the digital currency bitcoin to buy child sexual abuse images online, the IWF found.

Noelle Baynham was found by a close friend who let himself in after she failed to answer the door. The body had been partially eaten by the Jack Russell and Staffordshire Bull Terrier, which are initially thought to have tried to wake her before becoming desperate for food. It is believed the 61-year-old from Winchester, Hampshire, collapsed and died following an accidental overdose of medication. Eaten: Noelle Baynham's dogs started to eat her remains after being locked in the house for days. The most likely cause of death was an accidental overdose, an inquest was told . However a pathologist could not determine the exact cause of death because the dogs, who were trapped in the house, ate parts of her vital organs. Concerned friend Grant Donovan made the 'horrific' discovery of her remains after nobody answered the front door at her home. He told the inquest that he could hear her two dogs barking and jumping behind the door and became concerned that there did not appear to be anyone in with them. Finding the back door unlocked, he entered the house where he said the floors were covered in dog faeces. Walking through, he then discovered Ms Baynham's body lying on the landing. 'This was the most horrifying thing I have ever seen,' he told the inquest. 'I could not look at her long, so I just came away and called 999.' Detectives who searched the house following the grim discovery, on January 17 this year, could find no evidence of a struggle or foul play. The hearing was told how former jeweller Ms Baynham was found was in her dressing gown and had run a bath just before her death. Pets: A Staffordshire Bull Terrier (left) and Jack Russell (right) like the ones owned by\u00a0Noelle Baynham . Detective Constable Wesley Arnold from Hampshire Police told the coroner that scratch marks on her chest indicated that her dogs may have tried to wake her after she collapsed. Home Office pathologist Dr Amanda Jeffery reaveled that she had probably died 'a few days' before she was found, but because the dogs had eaten her organs it was impossible to establish exactly what had killed her. The 'combined effect' of a variety of drugs found in her system was likely to have been the cause of an accidental overdose, she added. The hearing was told that Ms Baynham suffered from bipolar disorder and chronic alcoholism and was prescribed a variety of medication. Blood tests found a range of drugs in her system including potentially toxic levels of painkillers. Recording an open verdict, senior central Hampshire coroner Grahame Short ruled that there was no evidence of suicide or an accidental fall, but said Ms Baynham may have had a stroke. 'The horrific element in this case is what happened after death rather than before, and it's entirely plausible that when there are dogs in the house with no one to care for them, that they will then start to eat her remains. 'That clearly was a major hindrance to Dr Jeffery in her examination, and as she's explained, she was not able to look at her important organs and she could not establish a clear cause of death.

Miss Walters, 21, was horrified to discover that the family looking after Magic had sold him at auction for just \u00a3200. Magic's fate has sparked fury in the equestrian community, and an appeal for his whereabouts has been shared 58,000 times on social media sites. Jade Walters, 21, was shocked to discover the family she loaned her beloved pet horse Magic to had sold the animal (pictured right and left being ridden by Miss Walters) for \u00a3200 . Selling a horse at auction is notoriously risky \u2013 bidders are not vetted and some horses are bought for slaughter. Miss Walters said: 'We would never in a million years have considered sending Magic to auction \u2013 they're horrible places. The thought makes me cry.' It was two months before she discovered the horse had been sold \u2013 making it all the more difficult to trace Magic, who could have been taken out of the country or sold to an abattoir. Miss Walters, who had owned the 17-year-old chestnut pony for seven years, said: 'I consider him like a child, he thinks of me as his mum and he's been taken from me. My heart is broken. 'He could be anywhere by now, I don't know how to find him and even if we do, what state will he be in?' The care assistant from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, advertised for a temporary owner last year after the cost of his upkeep went over \u00a34,000 a year. A woman in the West Country responded and took Magic to help her daughter improve her riding. Miss Walters pictured with her new horse Lad after her previous pet was sold at auction without her knowledge . Miss Walters said: 'He was getting very expensive. Loaning a horse is common for people who can't afford the expense of the purchase but can afford the upkeep. So while they don't have ownership, they have a duty of care. 'I was naive. The woman I loaned to seemed very respectable and said she wanted her 12-year-old daughter to get more experience riding.' But after six months, Magic's temporary owner said keeping the pony was too expensive and he was proving too difficult for her daughter to ride. They agreed that she would help Miss Walters look for an experienced rider to buy him for \u00a3500. But just 12 days later, on February 10, Magic was auctioned. However, Miss Walters did not find out until last week when she decided to bring Magic home. 'He has always been treated like a prince, so being fought over at an auction by a crowd looking for a quick deal makes me sick.' Her mother Julia, 53, said the woman had no right to auction Magic, adding: 'The arrangement was that if she had any interested parties, she would pass them to me. 'In no way was Magic to be sold without our knowledge.' Last night, the seller insisted there was 'another side to the story', but declined to comment further.", "reference": "Jade Walters, 21, loaned her horse Magic to help a young girl learn to ride .\nBut she was horrified to discover the family looking after him sold him .\nShe claims it was two months before she found out he was sold for \u00a3200 .\nNotoriously risky horse auctions often see animals being sold for slaughter ."}, "441": {"id": "fb18db83a80ba08bdcb0b624c7b6d25fc28bbfa5", "article": "Eden Hazard is reaching the incredible standards of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo with his \u2018dancing feet\u2019, says Graeme Souness.

A state prisons official says Hernandez, 25, was moved Wednesday to the maximum-security Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley, Massachusetts. Hernandez had been at Cedar Junction prison in Walpole since he was convicted April 15 of killing 27-year-old Odin Lloyd in 2013. Lloyd was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. Scroll down for video . Aaron Hernandez, 25, was convicted on April 15 of killing\u00a027-year-old Odin Lloyd (right) in 2013. He was sentenced to life in prison . Though Hernandez spent his first week after being convicted at Cedar Junction prison, he was moved on Wednesday to Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center (pictured) in Shirley, Massachusetts . Sousa-Baranowski Correctional Center is a maximum-security prison about 40 miles west of Boston, Massachusetts . Souza-Baranowski is the state Department of Correction's newest prison. It opened in 1998 and is about 40 miles west of Boston. It houses more than 1,000 inmates, many of whom are serving life sentences, and is named for two department employees killed during a failed escape attempt in 1972. Souza-Baranowski is considered the most advanced prison in the state by the state Department of Corrections, according to the Boston Herald. The facility has 366 cameras recording live 24 hours a day and a microwave detection perimeter with taut wire, according to CNN. Inmates in the prison are sent there because they 'present serious escape risks or pose serious threats to themselves, to other inmates, to staff, or the orderly running of the institution. Supervision of inmates is direct and constant'. Hernandez's new prison is about ten minues was from Fort Devens, where Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been held for the last two years . Hernandez will be Souza's most famous inmate. Larry Levine, a former federal inmate who now advises offenders heading to prison, said that some staff will treat him like anyone else, while some might ask Hernandez for his autograph . There are several placement options for an inmate at Souza: solitary confinement; a less harsh but still restricted block, general population; 'lifers block', for those serving life sentences; and the 'kitchen block', for those who work in the prison kitchen. It is unknown which area Hernandez will be put into. Hernandez will be Souza's most famous inmate yet, according to CNN. 'There will be a lot of staff that will treat him like an animal that he is, but there will be other staff that will want his autograph and treat him like a star,' said Larry Levine, a former federal inmate who spent 10 years in high- and minimum-security prisons and founded Wall Street Prison Consultants, which advises offenders and convicts heading to prison. It is unknown which cell block Hernandez will be placed in: solitary confinement; a less harsh but still restricted block, general population; 'lifers block', for those serving life sentences; and the 'kitchen block', for those who work in the prison kitchen . A corrections officer hands an inmate his meal through a small opening between the mess hall and the kitchen at Souza-Baranowski. This is how Hernandez will receive his meals . Ninety per cent of the inmates at the prison are locked in their cells, which include a bunk, toilet and sink combination, a small writing shelf, and a stool affixed to the floor, are locked in their cells for 19 hours a day. There is a shelf for a TV, which inmates can buy for about $200. The cells have two windows - one on the room's door that has slots for hand, middle and ankle cuffing, and a second that looks out to a wall, buildings or trees that is approximately 4in by 20in. On the same day as Hernandez's relocation, Lloyd's mother, Ursula Ward, said in a press conference that she will call Hernandez as a witness in the civil suit against him. In his new cell, Hernandez will be staying about ten minutes from Fort Devens, where for the last two years Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been held, according to WPRI.

The creature, named Hyalinobatrachium dianae, was found in the mountains of eastern Costa Rica and has a distinctive call. While most of its body is a brilliant lime green, like all species of glass frogs, the skin on its underside is see-though, making its organs easily visible. A new species of glass frog has been discovered with translucent skin so you can see its insides.\u00a0Hyalinobatrachium dianae (pictured) was found in the mountains of eastern Costa Rica and has a distinctive call . The animal\u2019s heart, liver and gastrointestinal tract are easily visible. Scientists were surprised to stumble across the frog, given that a through survey of the region was conducted late last century, and reported their find in the journal Zootaxa. The frog was named by Brian Kubicki who discovered it, after his mother Janet Diana Kubicki to thank her for supporting his interest in science, Costa Rica\u2019s Tico Times reported. The animal\u2019s heart, liver and gastrointestinal tract are easily visible (pictured) thanks to translucent skin on its under side.\u00a0It's distinguishable from other glass frogs which have this strange characteristic, by its long toes and black and white eyes . The bodies of glass frogs are bright green on their backs, while their abdominal skin is translucent. This means that the animal's heart, liver and gastrointestinal tract are visible. The first glass frog was discovered in 1872. They are thought to have originated in South America before spreading into Central America. Glass frogs are generally small, ranging from an inch to three inches in length (2.5cm to 7.5cm). They may look similar to tree frogs, but their eyes face forward, instead of sideways. The frogs are mostly arboreal, meaning that they live in trees and can be found along rivers and streams during the breeding season. Lead author of the study, Dr Kubicki said: Its advertisement call is quite unique\u2026It\u2019s different than any other species that has been discovered.\u2019 The study says the frog\u2019s \u2018advertisement call\u2019 consists of \u2018a single tonal long metallic whistle-like note with a duration of 0.40\u20130.55 s... and a dominant frequency of 3.35\u20133.44 kHz\u2019. It\u2019s likely the frog uses it to find a mate in the mountain forests. Dr Kubicki said that the amphibian sounds more like an insect than a frog, which may explain how experts missed it during their extensive survey. The frog also measures just one inch (2.5cm) long, making it relatively difficult to spot among the foliage in the west forests and rainforests of the Caribbean foothills of Costa Rica where it was discovered at elevations of between 1,312 ft to 2,624 ft (400\u2013800 m). There are 149 known species of glass frogs in Central and South America, 14 of which can be found in Costa Rica. H. dianae stands out from the others because of its captivating black and white eyes - which look similar to Kermit the frog\u2019s - as well as its long, thin feet. They have historically been mistaken for tree frogs, but there is a major difference \u2013 in that their eyes face forward, instead of sideways like a tree frog's. H. dianae stands out from other glass frogs because of its unusual black and white eyes (pictured left), which are similar to those of Kermit the Frog, of the Muppets (pictured right) in that they face forward . The frog was found in the mountains of eastern Costa Rica in the provinces ofHeredia and Limon (shaded in pale green) and has a distinctive call . Scientists have discovered an aphrodisiac for frogs and fish. Added to water, a supplement has been shown to boost reproduction in frogs, fish, mollusc and roundworms - and it could work for humans too, Phys.org reported. Experts from the University of Hertfordshire observed guppy fish at London Zoo. When the fish were given a peptide, or short protein, they produced four times as many offspring in six months as fish that had not nothing placed in their tanks. Similar tests were carried out on brown mentalla frogs at Paignton Zoo, leading the endangered amphibian from Madagascar to breed for the first time. Dr Keith Davies of the university, who is an expert on nematodes, or roundworms, said: 'The supplement brought reproductive activity forward and increased the number of offspring by about 80 per cent in the famous soil nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. 'What is suggested by our work is a biochemical mechanism of action that is conserved across the animal kingdom.' The scientists hope to extend their research so the aphrodisiac can be developed for mammals and humans.", "reference": "Hyalinobatrachium dianae was found in the mountains of east Costa Rica .\nIt's lime-coloured on top but has\u00a0translucent\u00a0skin on its underside .\nGlass frog has a distinctive mating call that resembles a tin whistle .\nDistinguished from other glass frogs by its eyes, which look like Kermit's ."}, "446": {"id": "e9efb02e379d1afd373eb650d6c35f9db09d680b", "article": "A leading Australian military adviser who worked for the federal government, the RAAF and Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove in East Timor has been arrested in the US on child pornography charges.

'I can confirm that he was a civilian employee and director of the Mahan Advanced Research Project at the US Naval War College,' Captain Christopher Dicomitis, a Rhode Island State Police detective, told AAP on Sunday. Cobb appeared in the US District Court in Providence on Friday and was refused bail. An investigation began in January when The National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children reported an individual in Rhode Island had uploaded child pornography to Tumblr.

But seeing the two men on the podium \u2013 one as the winner of the Bahrain Grand Prix, the other conducting the post-race interviews \u2013 was a reminder of what differentiates them as individuals as well as what binds them together as exceptional grand prix drivers. Hamilton could do considerably worse than learn a few things from and about Sir Jackie. Lewis Hamilton is interviewed by three-time world champion Sir Jackie Stewart after the Bahrain Grand Prix . Hamilton crosses the line in Bahrain ahead of Kimi Raikkonen to claim his third win from four races this term . Lewis probably will not want to hear it, judging by how he has previously dismissed Stewart\u2019s opinions, honestly given when sought as a pundit who speaks with all the authority of the most successful British Formula One driver in history. Hamilton said grouchily, that he was disappointed ex-drivers were not being more supportive, as if blind adoration was his birthright. Here are just a few reasons why Hamilton should listen to Sir Jackie. He drove in an era when a driver racing for five years had a two in three chance of dying. He changed that through tireless campaigning for safety measures to save not only drivers but spectators from preventable injuries. And then there is his charitable work for a children\u2019s club in the east end of London, for mechanics fallen on hard times, and dyslexia societies. There is also his considerable contribution to British industry over more than 40 years. A perfectionist, he will quietly remove a hair of your lapel as he speaks to you.

He might not spray champagne into the face of a girl on the podium as he did in China last week \u2013 hardly a hanging offence but, given that she could not respond, an inconsiderate act and an ungallant one. He might not gracelessly sulk, as he did most memorably at Monaco last year to Stewart\u2019s stated chagrin, when he is beaten. He might not be as surly as he can be at press conferences.

The complaint is that he has been wrongly arrested by the Bahraini authorities, who are suppressing freedom of speech. But it is worth recording that he has been charged with falsely (according to the government) accusing coalition forces in Yemen \u2013 including Bahrain \u2013 of promoting ethnic cleansing by targeting women, children and religious structures. He passed off these claims with photographs that were not from Yemen at all, but of dead children in Gaza and a dead baby in Syria, both from last year.

Forget Tiger. It was Player, of course, who wrote the book when it came to golfers and fitness. Heavens, he is still doing 1,300 sit-ups and squatting 300lb every morning even now, at the age of 79. He is withering in his contempt of those who say McIlroy is \u2018bulking up\u2019 too much in the gym. \u2018I\u2019m going to guess most of the critics are fat and don\u2019t watch what they eat,\u2019 he says. \u2018Just because they\u2019re lazy, they can\u2019t grasp that fitness is so vital. Tom Watson presents Player with a Green Jacket after the 1978 Masters Tournament at Augusta National . \u2018I was told that because I was so keen on fitness my career in golf would be over early and I wouldn\u2019t win any tournaments after the age of 34. I was told I had no chance of winning the US Open if I was squatting 325lb the previous evening. What rubbish. \u2018I\u2019m just so pleased to see travelling gymnasiums on the circuit and that most players see the value of putting themselves through the pain barrier. I used to go down to the local YMCA wherever we were playing and sometimes wait 20 minutes to use the equipment. But it you want to be a superstar, and by a superstar I mean a player who has won at least six majors, there are no short cuts. Woods could pose a threat to McIlroy at the Masters after confirming that he will play at Augusta . \u2018Rory will be an absolute superstar when he wins the Masters. And yes, I can see a lot of similarities with myself. I love the fact he is a people person, for example, and engages with the fans. That\u2019s what I used to love, and still do. So many pros can\u2019t be bothered to talk to the fans and it\u2019s so wrong.\u2019 Player also gives short shrift to the idea that completing the career Grand Slam is a modern media invention. \u2018I tell you it was electrifying when I completed it in 1965,\u2019 he said. \u2018I so wanted to follow Gene Sarazen and particularly Ben Hogan and become the third player to achieve it, because Hogan was the best player I\u2019d seen. Jack and I were both in competition to complete it and it was a piece of advice Jack gave me that helped me over the line. \u2018I was due to play a tournament at Greensboro in 1965 when Jack said if I wanted to win the US Open and complete the set I should go with him to the US Open site and practise. I said I needed the money, that I had loads of children to look after, but I went with him. So he played a key role. McIlroy manages a smile after throwing away a four-shot lead on the final day of the Masters in 2011 . Jack Nicklaus  waves before hitting his drive at the ceremonial start of the 2014 Masters golf tournament . \u2018It was amazing afterwards. Everyone wanted to know how a man from a small country who lost his mother at the age of eight and his dad worked in a mine could achieve such a thing. How on earth could it happen?\u2019 Player and Nicklaus have remained lifelong friends. They will be partners in a team competition in the autumn before Player heads to Greece for his 80th birthday celebrations. \u2018There will be 35 people there and Jack and I will need to win that event for me to be able to pay for it,\u2019 said Player, laughing. As for Augusta, he is looking forward as ever to hitting the ceremonial first shot on Thursday alongside Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer. And then, 50 years on from his own date with history, he will join every other fascinated observer to see if another non-American can complete the set of majors and join him on what former US Open champion Curtis Strange evocatively refers to as golf\u2019s Mount Rushmore.", "reference": "Gary Player considers Tiger Woods Grand Slam at 24 as best golfing feat .\nSouth African will attend his 58th Masters this week at Augusta National .\nPlayer is excited at the prospect of Rory McIlroy joining exclusive club .\nMcIlroy could become only the sixth player to win all four majors ."}, "450": {"id": "4c06b2676132c325f86b7d58d0b8b0cdb20e7ec1", "article": "Muslim communities in parts of Britain have a 'cultural problem' where they view women as commodities to be abused, according to the Culture Secretary.

It may be longer. In other words, there will be no execution less than 72 hours after notification,\" Tony Spontana told CNN by phone Sunday. Though Indonesian officials said all 10 would be executed at the same time, Spontana said French national Serge Atlaoui had filed a challenge to the State Administrative Court on Thursday so his sentence has been delayed. Meanwhile, Edre Olalia, a lawyer acting for Philippines maid Mary Jane Veloso, told CNN Sunday that Veloso had telephoned her sister on Saturday at about 5:30 p.m. local time and said her execution will take place on Tuesday, April 28.  Officials at the Philippines Embassy in Jakarta confirmed the same information. According to her lawyers, Veloso unknowingly carried drugs into Indonesia, and that she was set up by members of a drug syndicate. On Friday, Indonesian officials advised relevant consular officials to travel to Indonesia's \"execution island\" -- Nusa Kambangan -- where the ten are being held -- a sign that the sentences may be carried out soon. They will face a firing squad. OPINION: Why executions won't win Indonesia's drug war . The ten on death row, which also include two Australian citizens Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran -- members of the so-called \"Bali Nine\" smuggling ring -- as well as prisoners from Ghana, Brazil, Nigeria and Indonesia, had their petitions for clemency denied by President Joko Widodo in late 2014. A statement Sunday from Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the Australian government had been notified that the execution of Chan and Sukumaran would be carried out \"imminently.\" \"I spoke to Mr. Sukumaran's mother Raji yesterday and assured her the government would continue to seek clemency from Indonesian President Widodo for both men. \"They have been rehabilitated in a most remarkable way over the past ten years and are genuinely remorseful for their serious crimes. \"Nothing can be gained and much will be lost if these two young Australians are executed. \"I again respectfully call on the President of Indonesia to reconsider his refusal to grant clemency. It is not too late for a change of heart.\" The two Australians, convicted for their role in a failed 2005 heroin smuggling plot, tried to challenge the President's decision earlier this month but lost an appeal for the State Administrative Court to hear their case. Their lawyers have since filed another review at the Constitutional Court. The Attorney General's office has said they would respect all ongoing court proceedings but insisted the inmates have exhausted all their legal options. Australia has repeatedly appealed for clemency for the pair and has unsuccessfully proposed a prisoner swap with Indonesia as a way of avoiding their deaths. On Saturday, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on Indonesia's government to reverse their decision. \"The Secretary-General appeals to the government of Indonesia to refrain from carrying out the execution, as announced, of 10 prisoners on death row for alleged drug-related crimes,\" a spokesman for Ban said, according to various reports. Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch says President Widodo \"has an important opportunity to signal Indonesia's rejection of the death penalty by sparing the lives of the 10 people facing looming execution.\" \"Widodo can demonstrate true leadership by ending capital punishment as unacceptable state brutality,\" said Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, in a statement Saturday. \"President Widodo should recognize that the death penalty is not a crime deterrent but an unjustifiable and barbaric punishment. Widodo should promote Indonesia as a rights-respecting democracy by joining the countries that have abolished capital punishment.\"", "reference": "Australian and Philippines governments given notice their nationals will be executed in 72 hours .\nThey include Philippines maid Mary Jane Velos and Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran .\nAustralia has repeatedly appealed for clemency for the pair ."}, "452": {"id": "acc091a5702d885d22c8de39e8be3904bf137570", "article": "The richest fight of all time continues to break through the barriers of history \u2013 mostly in terms of financial records, naturally. For the first time in the annals of boxing \u2013 as Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao step on the scales next Friday \u2013 fans will be charged for admission to a weigh-in. This formality for checking that combatants weigh no more than the stipulated poundage for each division started to become an event in its own right in 2007 when Ricky Hatton went to Las Vegas to take his Man Of La Mancha tilt at the Mayweather windmill.

Mayweather visits SubZero Recovery in Las Vegas, a new-age version of the ice bath . No fewer than 30,000 of the Manchester Hitman's army followed him across the Atlantic and thousands of them turned up for the weigh-in. The atmosphere was electrified when Hatton yelled 'let's be having him' as Mayweather was about to follow him onto the stage. Hatton would be knocked out but there was more of the same when he went back to the MGM Grand to suffer the same fate against Pacquiao two years later. Since then weigh-ins there have turned into sound and light spectacles, taking place inside the Grand Garden Arena itself, and the audiences keep growing. The decision to sell tickets for this one has been made in the interests of safety, not profit. Up to 200,000 visitors are expected to pour into Vegas this fight week and the MGM need to control the crowds at all the associated events. Thousands of fans watched Ricky Hatton and Mayweather weigh-in at the MGM Grand Garden Arena . Hatton points towards the crowd during his heated weigh-in with Mayweather in December 2007 . Mayweather poses in his TMT clothing as he takes a break from training over the weekend . To avoid accusations of cashing in on the phenomenon the hotel and both promoters \u2013 Mayweather and Top Rank \u2013 will donate all revenue from the weigh-in to charities nominated by the Money Man and the PacMan. Mayweather and Pacquiao will be required to weigh not more than 10st 7lbs. The winner will unify the WBC (Mayweather) and WBO (Pacquiao) world welterweight titles. Wladimir Klitschko, as he makes a rare appearance in the US this Saturday, admits that at 39 he has to start considering when he might hang up those huge gloves. However, assuming he adds Bryant Jennings to his long list of victims, that will not happen before Dr Iron Fist has obliged the two young pretenders to his heavyweight throne. Namely our own Tyson Fury and America's KO sensation Deontay Wilder. Wladimir Klitschko has admitted that he is considering retirement as he approaches his 40th birthday . Klitschko says: 'I do have to start thinking about retirement.' But then the Ukrainian who boxes mostly to sell-out crowds in German football stadia, adds: 'I would like to fight Fury, which would be a huge event in Europe. 'I want to fight Wilder, to add the only remaining belt to my unified world titles.' Unusually, both men would present Klitschko with opposition as tall or, in Fury's case, even taller than his own 6ft 6in. Fury is his mandatory challenger for the WBO title. Wilder holds the WBC title which was vacated by Klitschko's brother Vitali when he retired to concentrate on the violent complexities of Ukrainian politics as Mayor of Kiev. WBC heavyweight champions Deontay Wilder looks set to face\u00a0Klitschko before he hangs up his gloves . Wladimir is also the WBA, IBF, IBO and Ring magazine champion. There is another factor which will tempt him to prolong his reign even further. Currently he ranks fourth in the all-time list of successive world heavyweight title defences, with 18. Victories over Jennings \u2013 which looks to be something of a formality in New York's Madison Square Garden, would lift him level with Muhammad Ali and Larry Holmes on 19. If he adds wins over Fury and Wilder he will close to within just four victories of the 25-defences record held by Joe Louis. That is likely to be an opportunity too good to refuse. Tyson Fury, pictured in action against Dereck Chisora, is Klitschko's mandatory challenger for the WBO title . The crushing defeat of Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr by the largely unheralded and, in terms of his first name, unpronounceable Pole Andrzej Fonfara, complicates Carl Froch's exit strategy from the ring. One of Froch's two dream scenarios has been a farewell fight in Las Vegas, probably against Chavez with his box office appeal for America's Hispanic population and fans south of the border in Mexico. But the namesake son of an idolised father was so badly beaten up through nine rounds in California by Fonfara \u2013 suffering the first knock down of his career in the process \u2013 that he quit on his stool. Carl Froch could choose to retire after\u00a0Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr's defeat by\u00a0Andrzej Fonfara last week . Inadvisedly, Chavez had agreed to a catch-weight fight with light-heavyweight contender Fonfara and is talking about going back down to Froch's super-middleweight division. Whether this former middleweight champion would still be a draw after this setback is doubtful and Froch had said before the fight that it would hurt his plans 'if Chavez got knocked out. The other swansong ambition \u2013 to fight on the City Ground of his beloved Nottingham Forest \u2013 suffered a setback when Andre Ward agreed to come to England for their mandatory WBA title unifier but not to Froch's home town.

Feeling hungry: Sarah shared this photo of two In-N-Out burgers on Tuesday afternoon, although its not clear as to whether or not she enjoyed the meal before or after she gave birth . An APGAR score, which stands for Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration, is a quick method for assessing the health of a newborn, with scores of seven or above being considered normal. Sarah famously documented her changing figure via her Instagram\u00a0page throughout her pregnancy, earning herself a huge number of fans - as well as a fair share of critics - in the process. Although the mother-to-be came under fire last month as more and more critics spoke out against her unusually trim and toned figure, claiming it could be harmful to her unborn child, their comments never stopped the model from sharing numerous photos of her tight abs with her 1.6 million Instagram followers.

Haters gonna hate: Sarah, who came under fire for her being tiny and toned throughout her pregnancy, told her critics to unfollow her if they have a problem with her pictures . Proud of her bump: Sarah struck various photos for these selfies of herself in her underwear . 'I'm completely inspired to go to the gym first thing in the morning. You look absolutely gorgeous @sarahstage #amazing [sic],' one fan wrote. 'You look absolutely lovely. Hats off to you for being fit and taking care of yourself!' another added. 'If I ever have children, I'm inspired by you to treat my pregnancy the very same way. I'm sure James will be amazing! Congratulations.' Others compared their figures to pregnant Sarah's pregnancy body, with one woman writing: '10 days before giving birth?! Lord Jesus help us all! I look like this after dinner [sic].' 'I look like that after a good meal or two,' someone else commented. Meanwhile, some people suggested that her son would be as tiny as she is - although now it seems that their fears about the young boy's size were unfounded. Bump to bump: Sarah and her friend compared their growing bellies for this playful picture . Just like dad: Sarah shared this adorable photo of matching father and son Timberland boots . 'Baby James will come out the size of her phone case,' one person commented, referencing the model's bear-shaped cell phone cover. And when she's not sharing lingerie selfies, the new mother regularly shared pictures of her son's nursery and his future wardrobe. Last week, Sarah shared an adorable photo of matching father and baby sized Timberland boots, writing: 'Daddy & baby shoe game [sic].'

The tumour had wrapped itself around her organs and up her spine to near her heart, and was releasing huge amounts of adrenaline, which meant that the toddler needed to be put on heart medication to balance her racing heartbeat of 200 beats per minute. Rosannah was admitted to hospital immediately, and began chemotherapy treatment on the huge tumour, in the hope that it would shrink to a size which could be operated on. 'The oncologist said to us that he was hopeful that after four rounds of chemotherapy it would be able to be removed. While we were waiting for the rounds Rosannah got quite sick and contracted a staph infection,' Ms Searle said. The seven kilogram tumour is pressing against her spine and vital organs causing her swollen stomach . Rosannah's aunt Jessica Searle is seeking treatment for her niece in the United States . Rosannah had four rounds of chemotherapy which her oncologist had hoped would shrink the tumour . 'It's been quite a battle for the poor little thing.' Rosannah and Jamielee, a single mother, have been staying in Ronald McDonald House while the rest of their family lives several hours away in country NSW. A day before her last chemotherapy treatment, Rosannah's mother Jamielee gave birth to her second child, Skylah, and just two week later, was told that the chemotherapy hadn't been successful in reducing the tumour to an operable size. 'We were told that the chemotherapy had been ineffective because the tumour had developed a protective barrier which meant it was immune. They also couldn't put her into radiation therapy because of how close it is to her organs,' said Ms Searle. Rosannah's extended family have now begun reaching out to specialists overseas in the hope that there may be treatment available in the United States that is not available in Australia. A day before Rosannah's last chemotherapy treatment, her mother gave birth to her little sister Skylah . Ms Seale said that Rosannah's mother has been very strong even through the delivery of Skylah (right) Her oncologist has also continued to seek advice, and the family is hopeful that a solution will be found to buy some more time for the 'fun-loving' little girl. 'She's a cracker of a child, despite her pale skin and overly large stomach you wouldn't pick that she has something wrong with her,' said Ms Searle. 'She's very carefree and runs wild like any other child, she's a very happy little girl.' However, it has been a month since Rosannah's last treatment, and her aunt said she is beginning to experience more pain as her condition worsens. 'She's been eating less and can't walk for more than a few metres before she falls over in pain, crying,' Ms Searle said. 'We found out this week that this is because the tumour is pushing on her spinal cord and catching the nerves there,' she said. 'Sometimes when I look into her eyes it's like she knows something is really wong.' Ms Seale said that the family and Rosannah's oncologist aren't giving up hope, and that they are determined to keep searching for a solution. The family is hopeful that a solution will be found to buy some more time for the 'fun-loving' little girl . 'She's very carefree and runs wild like any other child, she's a very happy little girl,' said Ms Seale . It has been a month since Rosannah's last treatment, and her aunt said she is beginning to experience more pain as her condition worsens . 'Her oncologist is looking into using a specialised dye which is currently used to show where the cancer is in her body, but could possibly kill the cells if used in a strong enough dose,' she said. 'But he can't promise anything and so both he and our family are talking to overseas specialists about the next step.' Ms Seale has set up a GoFundMe page to raise money to help Rosannah and her mother fly to the US to seek treatment not available in Australia. 'I feel as though the health system has failed her big time. We want to buy her some time, and the only thing holding us back is the financial side.' Ms Seale said that the whole ordeal has been exhausting, and pyschologically is beginning to take it's toll. 'I've been trying to support Jamielee, going back and forth and doing everything I can to make sure she doesn't feel like she's alone,' she said. 'I am so proud and amazed by how strong she is. If I was in that position I wouldn\u2019t be coping. She just gets up and soldiers on, she hasn\u2019t cried, she\u2019s doing really well,' said Ms Searle. Ms Seale, who has a three-year-old son herself, said that she wants as many people as possible to come forward and support Rosannah. 'We just want to give her the best opportunity at life, and we can't do that here,' she said.", "reference": "Rosannah Gundry, 19 months old, was diagnosed with stage three neuroblastoma cancer in December last year .\nDoctors found a seven kilogram tumour growing in her abdomen .\nIt is pressing against her spinal cord and vital organs, making it difficult for her to walk or eat without pain .\nAfter undergoing four rounds of chemotherapy, the tumour is inoperable .\nHer family is now seeking to travel to the US for alternative treatment ."}, "457": {"id": "c07cd33a257ee817d3cc77ebc48592fc817ea886", "article": "A 100-year-old New Jersey man killed his 88-year-old wife with an ax while she slept before he went into the bathroom and committed suicide with a knife, according to authorities.

Researchers have created a sensor that can recognise the unique shape of your ear, your palm or any other body part you want to use to access your device. Called Bodyprint, the technology turns a standard touchscreen into a biometric scanner removing the need to specialist hardware such as fingerprint readers or infrared cameras. Scroll down for video . Researchers at Yahoo Labs in California have created a sensor that can recognise the shape of your ear or any other body part you want to access your device (shown) Bodyprint was devised by Christian Holz, Senaka Buthpitiya, and Marius Knaust from the California-based Yahoo Labs. Details of its algorithm are included in their\u00a0paper, Bodyprint: Biometric User Identification on Mobile Devices Using the Capacitive Touchscreen to Scan Body Parts. The Salt card is designed to end the tiresome task of manually unlocking a smartphone or tablet by automatically making it come to life whenever the user is nearby. The credit card-sized gadget also locks devices again as soon as a user moves out of range at a distance of ten feet (three metres). Salt connects to an app on a user\u2019s Android handset or iPhone via Bluetooth and also tells them if they have strayed too far from their wallet, where the firm suggests the Salt card is stored. The card was created by Illinois-based duo Joel Paglione and Niko Zistakis.. They claim it will save people around 53 hours over a year, based on the belief that the average phone user unlocks their phone 150 times a day. 'Recent mobile phones integrate fingerprint scanners to authenticate users biometrically and replace passwords, making authentication more convenient for users,' explained the researchers. 'However, due to their cost, capacitive fingerprint scanners have been limited to top-of-the-line phones, a result of the required resolution and quality of the sensor.' They continued that while the input resolution of a touchscreen is around six dots per inch (dpi) - meaning it can't capture the level of detail in a fingerprint - the surface area is larger than a more advanced reader. This allows the touch sensor 'to scan users\u2019 body parts, such as ears, fingers, fists, and palms by pressing them against the display.' To accept an incoming call, users would only need to press their ear against the phone. During tests with 12 participants, Bodyprint classified body parts with 99.98 per cent accuracy and identified users with 99.52 per cent accuracy. This accuracy was highest when scanning the ear due to its more unique shape and size. It\u2019s not just ears that could be used for identification \u2013 your first, phalanges (in your fingers), palm or just your fingertips could also be used (shown). This means that just gripping the phone could unlock it for you . A video demonstrating the technology revealed Bioprint can also be used to add multiple users to a single device. So, for example, if something required dual identification then both people could provide it. It\u2019s not just ears that could be used for identification - your fist, phalanges (in your fingers), palm or your fingertips could also be used. This means that just gripping the phone could unlock it for you. There's no news yet on when the feature might be made available to manufacturers, but the team says their next step is to continue testing.

Ms Jobs, 51, called former First Lady Hillary a 'revolutionary' woman, and added that it's not just because she's a woman - but 'the type of woman she is'. Speaking to Time 100, Ms Jobs said: 'Hillary Clinton is not familiar. She is revolutionary. Not radical, but revolutionary: The distinction is crucial. She is one of America\u2019s greatest modern creations. Laurene Jobs, pictured, widow of Apple's Steve, has strongly backed Hillary Clinton for president . Laurene Jobs said that Hillary Clinton, right, has 'judgment and wisdom' based on her public service . 'Her decades in our public life must not blind us to the fact that she represents new realities and possibilities. Indeed, those same decades have conferred upon her what newness usually lacks: judgment, and even wisdom. 'It matters, of course, that Hillary is a woman. But what matters more is what kind of woman she is.' Mrs Clinton announced her intention to seek the Democratic nomination on Sunday - and set upon the campaign trail with a trip to meet 'ordinary' voters in Iowa. But she was blasted for her 'staged' visit on Tuesday morning to a coffee shop in LeClaire, Iowa. Austin Bird, one of the men pictured sitting at the table with Mrs Clinton, claimed the whole event was orchestrated 'from beginning to end'. STAGED: Clinton sat to talk with three young Iowans at a coffee shop on Tuesday \u2013 all of whom were driven to the event by her Iowa campaign's political director . NOT SO ORDINARY: Austin Bird is a Democratic Party insider who chauffeured Vice President Joe Biden around Davenport, Iowa in October during a pre-election campaign trip . Bird told Daily Mail Online that campaign staffer Troy Price called and asked him and two other young people to meet him Tuesday morning at a restaurant in Davenport, a nearby city. Price then drove them to the coffee house to meet Clinton after vetting them for about a half-hour. The three got the lion's share of Mrs. Clinton's time and participated in what breathless news reports described as a 'roundtable'\u2013 the first of many in her brief Iowa campaign swing. Bird himself is a frequent participant in Iowa Democratic Party events. He interned with President Obama's 2012 presidential re-election campaign, and was tapped to chauffeur Vice President Joe Biden in October 2014 when he visited Davenport. 'What happened is, we were just asked to be there by Troy,' Bird said Wednesday in a phone interview. 'We were asked to come to a meeting with Troy, the three of us, at the Village Inn.' The other two, he confirmed, were University of Iowa College Democrats president Carter Bell and Planned Parenthood of the Heartland employee Sara Sedlacek. 'It was supposed to be a strategy meeting,' Bird recalled, 'to get our thoughts about issues. But then all of a sudden he says, \"Hey, we have Secretary Clinton coming in, would you like to go meet her?\"' 'And then we got in a car \u2013 Troy's car \u2013 and we went up to the coffee house, and we sat at a table and then Hillary just came up and talked with us.' Bird said 'we all were called.' 'I mean, Troy asked us all to do \u2013 to go to a meeting with him. And we didn't really know what it was about. I mean, he did. He knew.' It's unclear how many Iowans featured in photographs with Clinton that rocketed around the country on Tuesday were planted. 'The mayor of LeClaire was there, and his wife was there,' Bird said, recalling the scene at the coffee shop. Price was executive director of the Iowa Democratic Party until a month ago. Clinton's team tapped him last week to be its political director in Iowa. He did not respond to a request for comment. Bird is a government and community relations coordinator at Genesis Health System in Davenport, Iowa, according to his LinkedIn profile. A coworker at Genesis said Wednesday that Bird is 'basically a lobbyist in training. That's what he wants to do.' Bird disagreed, saying his role was 'more public relations.' He's also an outspoken progressive whose Facebook wall shows he ordered a 'Hillary For President' bumper sticker\u00a022 months ago. 'Is it 2016 yet?' he wrote in May 2013. Clinton's nascent campaign has carefully coordinated her image as a spontaneous, handshaking populist in her first days as a candidate, posing with Pennsylvanians at a gas station and venturing into an Ohio Chipotle restaurant for lunch. When no one recognized the former first lady \u2013 she was wearing sunglasses \u2013 the campaign leaked information to The New York Times so its reporters could get security-camera footage to prove she had tried to mingle with voters. Scripting supposedly off-the-cuff appearances is common in presidential politics but could hurt Clinton especially hard since her gonzo road-trip journey to America's broad midwest is designed to counter her image as cold, calculating and politically venomous. And planting party insiders in place of typical Iowans won't go over well in the Hawkeye State, where pressing the flesh and collecting caucus votes is a quadrennial full-contact sport. ASTROTURF: Setting up faux events for news cameras is nothing new in politics, but Iowans take presidential contests seriously and could punish Clinton for the deception . THE FIXER: Bird said Troy Prince (left, pictured with VP Joe Biden), who was executive director of the Iowa Democratic Party until he left last month to help Clinton's statewide political effort, recruited him and others to attend the 'spontaneous' coffee meeting . Clinton's campaign has already taken heat for depicting at least three people in her campaign launch video as 'everyday' Americans who were actually partisans with political connections. One was even a former campaign manager for Wendy Davis, the Texas Democrat who mounted a failed bid for Texas governor last year. In LeClaire on Tuesday,\u00a0Bloomberg and other outlets referred to Bird as a 'student' at St. Ambrose University, not as a hospital government-affairs staffer with Democratic party street-cred. He does study at St. Ambrose \u2013 part-time. But Bird's ties to the party are deep enough that his Facebook wall includes a photo of him standing in front of Joe Biden's limousine in Davenport. 'I was driving the Vice President when he was in town in October,' Bird noted in a Facebook comment. Biden was not there on official government business, but for a campaign stop in support of Democrat Bruce Braley.

As they settled back into their seats, the rest of the Emirates Stadium exploded into verse about Mourinho, with advice as to where he should go. The Chelsea manager and his assistant Steve Holland had been complaining about the charge from goal by goalkeeper David Ospina which flattened Oscar in the first half, but which was not adjudged to be a foul. Cesc Fabregas returned to Emirates Stadium for the first time since leaving for Barcelona in 2011 . Francis Coquelin of Arsenal evades Fabregas of Chelsea during the 0-0 draw at Emirates Stadium on Sunday . Every Fabregas touch was booed as he operated in the first half in a deep role alongside Nemanja Matic . Fabregas - without his mask on - swaps shirts and salutes the Emirates crowd at full time . The pass to Oscar had been wonderfully delivered by Cesc Fabregas, masked villain of the day in this North London postcode, having the temerity to return in blue nearly four years after agitating to leave Arsenal for Barcelona. Every Fabregas touch was booed. And he didn\u2019t hide. He was influential, operating in the first half in a deep role alongside Nemanja Matic, from where he is often more creative, before moving forward after the break into a No.10 role (and removing the protective mask). There were a lot of touches and a lot of boos. He rarely misplaced a pass but when he did the home crowd cheered. And no cheer was louder than the one when referee Michael Oliver booked him for a dive. It might not, in fact, have been a dive. Santi Cazorla and Fabregas collided knee-to-knee but the Chelsea midfielder also trailed a leg in search of contact more definite and made the it all seem a little too contrived. Oliver was on the spot. So much so that a split-second earlier, he had made a better effort than Cazorla at winning the ball. The referee ruled in Arsenal\u2019s favour, and this proved a very popular decision. There was a rare energy about the Emirates and noise levels not normally associated with the stadium. Make no mistake, this one mattered to those in red. It mattered beyond the confines of the 90 minutes and the points won and lost in what remains of this title race. It was about next season. How close are Arsene Wenger\u2019s team to challenging Chelsea for the title? Can they alter the balance of power in the capital? Can they close the gap at the top of the Barclays Premier League? Of course there were a couple of hate-figures in the vicinity. Animosity levels were up but Arsenal have been brilliant since the turn of the year, with one notable exception, and this was an opportunity to make a statement. Chelsea midfielder Oscar had to be replaced at half-time after a painful-looking collision with\u00a0David Ospina . Arsene Wenger (left) has not beaten Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho (right) in 13 games as the hoodoo continues . Santi Cazorla of Arsenal reacts after a missed chance during his side's 0-0 draw with Chelsea . It was time to get over the players they didn\u2019t sign and get behind those they did. Mourinho showed respect to Alexis Sanchez by starting with Ramires wide on the right to offer defensive cover and limiting Branislav Ivanovic\u2019s involvement as an attacking force, preferring the muscular Serb to mind the Chilean. There were flashes of what Arsenal do well and supporters rejoiced in flourishes, like a back-heel or two by Aaron Ramsey or a sliver of skill from Mesut Ozil, but they could not beat Thibaut Courtois. Arsenal fans sang: 'Boring Boring Chelsea' when they failed to penetrate, and the jeers for Fabregas were transformed into applause when he was substituted in the last minute. By then the game seemed destined to end goalless. Chelsea, had reverted to the six-man defensive shield at half-time by dropping Ramires deeper, and finished the game with centre-half Kurt Zouma also in central midfield. Mourinho was determined to leave with the clean sheet he came for and, left the more satisfied of the two managers. They remain on course for the title and celebrated at the final whistle. Wenger, meanwhile, cannot crack the Jose-hoodoo. There is work to do in the summer if this gap is to be closed.

Patricia Jannuzzi was put on administrative leave last month and was asked to disable her Facebook page when her comments drew wide publicity, in part after school alumnus Scott Lyons wrote a critical letter that was shared online by Thelma & Louise star Susan Sarandon, who's his aunt. Another one of Jannuzzi's posts compared a lesbian relationship to news of Egyptian men being beheaded and she said that 'secular materialists (are) making our country so weak we cannot fight the dictatorship of Militant Islam.' Patricia Jannuzzi, right, who wrote in a Facebook post that gays were behind an 'agenda' to 'reengineer western civ into slow extinction', has been reinstated at Immaculata High School despite protests from the likes of Susan Sarandon . A letter was sent on Friday to faculty and staff members at Immaculata High School in Somerville saying Jannuzzi had been reinstated, Gannett New Jersey\u00a0reports. Monsignor Seamus Brennan, pastor of the Church of the Immaculate Conception, said in the letter that Catholic teachers should communicate the faith in 'a way that is positive and never hurtful.' 'Tone and choice of words matter and I trust Mrs. Jannuzzi's stated promise to strive always to teach in a spirit of truth and charity,' Brennan wrote. He cited Jannuzzi's 'otherwise good reputation as an educator over 30 years at Immaculata' as a factor. After school officials and Diocese of Metuchen Bishop Paul Bootkoski distanced themselves from Jannuzzi's remarks, the diocese was on the end of a backlash from conservatives and traditionalists upset that the school and church did not side with their teacher against a liberal Hollywood activist. Jannuzzi's family, fearing she would lose her job, raised more than $31,000 online.

In a statement posted on the fundraising page, Jannuzzi's attorney David Oakley said all of the contributions would be returned. Oakley said Jannuzzi was 'very happy' with the turn of events. 'I'm delighted with the understanding,' he said Friday. 'We're grateful to the school for engaging in the process.' Michael Hichborn, president of Lepanto Institute, the conservative Catholic group that paid for the radio ads, said on Friday he was surprised by the news. Sarandon's nephew Scott Lyons has criticized his former school for reinstating a teacher who he accused of 'blatant intolerance for the LGBT community' 'That's excellent. It was a great injustice and thank God that the right outcome came about,' he said. 'If they changed their mind I hope it is for a matter of justice and not for a matter of looking to see which way the wind is blowing.' The alumni petition on Change.org was closed by the organizer with 1,188 signatures. In a message, organizer Tom Robinson declared victory. 'As a result of the petition, Immaculata High School acknowledged the problem and decided to review their social media policy. Due to the media firestorm that occurred, the teacher was put on administrative leave,' he said.

She finally decided to do something about the problem after she realised the constant need for the Red Bull was severely damaging her health. And after seeing hypnotherapist earlier this month, she claims she has been cured of her addiction thanks to just one 50-minute session. Her habit had been so dangerous she needed to cut down to eight cans a day in the run up to the hypnosis - as coming off so much caffeine abruptly could have caused a seizure. A 250ml can of Red Bull contains: . 80mg of caffeine - the same amount as in an espresso. 27.5g sucrose and glucose combined - the equivalent of almost seven teaspoons of sugar. 10g Taurine (an amino acid that is thought to boost athletic performance).

'It is hard to say when it became every day but I remember that by 2009 I was definitely hooked. 'Whenever I felt tired having a Red Bull would be the first thing I would do. 'It was  worst in 2010 when I was doing law exams at university and my children were off school. 'Sometimes I would have exams day after day - and with the stress of revising I was having 24 cans a day. 'I was pulling all-nighters and using the drinks to stay awake. In the end, it got to the point where I just needed Red Bull to function. 'I used to get my shopping delivered and used to have four or five crates and that only lasted for a week - it got out of hand. 'There would be times when I would get palpitations and shakes but I think I just got used to the caffeine.' Red Bull - whose slogan says the drink 'gives you wings' - is made by an Austrian company and is the highest selling energy drink in the world. Miss Weatherill claims she was cured of her addiction in one 50 minutes hypnotherapy session with\u00a0David Kilmurry (pictured right) This table shows a range of drinks in order of caffeine content and their relation to daily allowances. Ms Weatherill was drinking 1.92g of caffeine every day, way above the recommended limit of 400 mg . The drink has been branded safe by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and more than five billion cans were sold in 2013. However, it has been criticised for its high caffeine levels with one 250ml can containing 80mg, similar to one cup of coffee. Ms Weatherill's 24-a-day habit meant she was drinking 1.92g of the drug every day. A 2005 study into caffeine-related deaths said a person would need to ingest 5g to overdose, suggesting she was taking nearly half of a lethal dose. But, incredibly, she claims she was completely cured of her addiction after a single session with cognitive behavioral hypnotherapist David Kilmurry on April 11. Ms Weatherill, who lives with boyfriend Phil Evans, 27, and four children aged between three and 14, added: 'I knew at the start of this year it was a dependency so thought I would give hypnotherapy a go. 'It was a weird process, I felt like I was in there for 15 minutes but it was 50 minutes. 'All I can remember is that it was like a kaleidoscope effect, I remember him saying I didn't need Red Bull.' 'I am convinced I won't have another can. I feel like a different person,' Ms Weatherill said after undergoing hypnotherapy to cure her of her energy drink habit . She added: 'It was like a paralysis because I had an itch, but couldn't move to scratch it. 'It gave me a lot of strength because in the past I have tried to give up but lasted a week and then gone back to the Red Bull. 'I am convinced I won't have another can. I feel like a different person.' Hypnotherapist Mr Kilmurry added: 'Sarah's addiction was very serious. 'Coming off that amount of caffeine and taurine  can lead to seizures, so she gradually reduced her intake before coming to me to make a safe escape. 'Energy drink addicts can also suffer insomnia, depression, anxiety and heart palpitations. 'Luckily Sarah soldiered through and has been amazed at the changes.'", "reference": "Sarah Weatherill, 31, spent \u00a35, 460 every year on the popular energy drink .\nHer 24-a-day habit left her lethargic, depressed and with heart palpitations .\nIf she cut down too quickly she was told she risked suffering a seizure .\nClaims her addiction was cured by one 50 minute hypnosis session ."}, "477": {"id": "eb7f066db561c9230940fcf74fd1582295be38c9", "article": "Ed Balls has been accused of treating the public with 'contempt' after dismissing as a 'joke' the infamous Labour note admitting the party had blown the nation's finances. The shadow chancellor said the letter, left in the Treasury by the former Labour minister Liam Byrne in 2010, was just a 'jokey note'. Mr Byrne's glib note to his successor as Treasury Secretary stated: 'Dear Chief Secretary, I'm afraid there is no money. Kind regards \u2013 and good luck! Liam.' Scroll down for video . Damaging: Labour's Liam Byrne sent left this handwritten note to his successor before he left the Treasury in 2010 . The note has become emblematic of Labour's fiscal irresponsibility in office and was used by David Cameron in the seven-way leaders' debate earlier this month. When the Coalition took office in 2010 the budget deficit had reached more than \u00a3150billion \u2013 more than 10 per cent of the entire size of the economy. But Mr Ball insisted the note admitting that Labour had blown the nation's finances should not be taken seriously. He told BBC West Midlands: 'Liam Byrne's note was a jokey note\u2026 of the course the money hadn't run out.' Mr Balls said Labour would cut the deficit \u2013 still running at \u00a390billion a year \u2013 every year. He said: 'Nothing in our manifesto is going to require additional borrowing. I think in tough times, people want a government which will make tough decisions, and will make the sums add up, and that is what we're saying very clearly today.' But he was asked if Labour was 'credible' and could be trusted with the economy. Mr Balls said: 'I think people want to know the sums add up. People know that the global financial crisis wasn't caused by Labour's spending \u2013 it wasn't Labour's spending on nurses and doctors which meant the Lehman Brothers investment bank went bankrupt in New York. 'Liam Byrne's note was a jokey note, of course the money hadn't run out.' Ed Balls, pictured in Birmingham today, said the letter, left in the Treasury by the former Labour minister Liam Byrne in 2010, was just a 'jokey note' Mr Balls blamed the Lib Dem minister David Laws for leaking the note. He said it was supposed to be a private note, adding: 'It was supposed to be a piece of humour. In fact, in that year, the government spend hundreds of billions of pounds, so of course the money hadn't run out, but there was a large deficit, and we had to get it down, and we needed to get it down in a fair way. 'The reason why we're more credible than the Tories now is that they're not people who understand the need for change in the economy, it's not been all in it together, they've not even balanced the books \u2013 it's going to take a Labour government to do it.' Former Treasury Secretary Liam Byrne left the note to his successor David Laws in 2010 . The Tories this morning slammed Mr Balls's remarks \u2013 claiming they showed that he had not learnt the lessons from the great economic crash. Treasury minister David Gauke said: 'The fact that Ed Balls thinks the debt they left the country was a 'joke' goes to show the contempt they hold the public in. 'It is clear Labour has not learnt the lessons of the past and would do the same all over again - more taxes, more borrowing and more debt.' The letter has haunted Labour for years, allowing Tory and Liberal Democrat ministers to prove the nation's coffers were empty. The letter consisting of just 18 words it offers no apology or justification for the state of the nation's finances, only a glib 'good luck' to whoever was left to clear up the economic mess. Written in blue ink on government note paper, it was opened by Lib Dem David Laws who became Chief Secretary to the Treasury when the coalition was formed. Lib Dem Mr Laws said: 'He left a note which frankly does sum up precisely the state of the Treasury when he left it. I think it is refreshing that a Labour politician has been prepared to admit that.' Mr Byrne has admitted he will regret it for the rest of his life. He said: 'It was a very foolish thing to do. 'I suppose I did think there was a convention amongst honourable members that private correspondence would stay private. 'There's obviously a very old tradition of these notes that goes back to the 1930s. I felt disappointed that some very old conventions had been cast aside for political advantage.'", "reference": "Letter was left in the Treasury by the former minister Liam Byrne in 2010 .\nIt said: 'Dear Chief Secretary, I'm afraid there is no money.

The 78 Irish travellers, who hail from just four families, had refused to budge despite facing three different courts, a planning inquiry and a council. And locals in Hardhorn, Lancashire, accused the group  of trashing their leafy village - and branded them the 'neighbours from hell'. A gipsy group who exploited human rights laws to stay in their illegal camp for more than five years have won another legal battle to stay . The group claimed the eviction 'violated' the human rights of the 39 children living on the site in 60 caravans . Last October, the camp, which had flouted planning rules, appeared to have lost its case after the travellers were told to move out by the Court of Appeal. But despite being given four months to leave the site without the chance to appeal, the group used a loophole to take their case to the Supreme Court. They claimed the eviction 'violated' the human rights of the 39 children living on the site in 60 caravans. The Supreme Court later rejected pleas for the group to be allowed the right of appeal under a 'point of law of general public importance.' But now it has been revealed that a further judicial review at the High Court has been granted. Fylde Council said that fighting the 'Battle of Hardhorn' has already cost the local authority \u00a3200,000 in legal fees which will be met by the public purse. Parish councillor Maxine Chew said: 'It is a disgrace that a shocking amount of public money has been spent fighting this. 'The travellers really have been the neighbours from hell. The amount of anti-social behaviour like fly tipping, theft, drunkenness has escalated hugely in the past four years since the travellers set up camp.' The camp (pictured) appeared to have lost its case after the travellers were told to move out by the Court of Appeal last year . A village spokesman added: 'After five years five months the travellers site have fought every decision, we believe that they have used legal aid to fight the Secretary of State and Fylde BC. 'The question what we would like to know is how these people qualified for legal aid? Using taxpayers' money to fight the taxpayer!' He added the decision to hold a\u00a0judicial review on the grounds presented is 'totally wrong'. 'This community will be devastated with this news as we have been so patient and have endured over 450 negative incidents over the five-plus years. 'Over eight caravans set on fire to burn refuse, horses killed & dogs killed on the road from the site, drunken labourers asleep in gardens, police raids and many cases of ASB. 'The judge might have had a different view if he lived by this site. We wanted this ordeal to come to an end. There are or have been three houses for sale in Hardhorn and not one has sold in the 5 years. 'How can the application that is being challenged suddenly be overturned using a new application, the hearing was on the old application.' A judge gave permission for the judicial review application to proceed after arguments over legal technicalities regarding the processes of planning permission. Fylde Council said the legal battle has already cost the local authority \u00a3200,000 which will be met by the public purse . The saga began after a field in the village was sold by a farmer to a travelling family from West Yorkshire . The full judicial review will be held on either July 29 or 30. The saga began in November 2009 after a field in the village - which featured in BBC's Gardeners World - was sold by a farmer to a travelling family from West Yorkshire. The travellers then set up camp after sneaking in during the the dead night in what neighbours described as a 'military-style operation' and after council offices had closed for the weekend . The group of around 30 adults and 40 children, from Irish and Scottish families, immediately began work laying foundations under outdoor spot lights. Angry villagers wrote to local councillors, raising concerns about noise, road safety and a potential drop in house prices with one saying he and his wife had not been able to sleep due to noise from the site. Locals had complained of the travellers leaving generators running 24 hours a day, poaching, trespassing, and leaving dogs to bark all night, while others had complained they had been verbally abused. Officials at Fylde District Council later went to a district judge to stop the group laying hardcore foundations to make their 2.4 hectare site more permanent. They were granted an injunction banning the travellers from bringing more caravans onto the land but were ordered to allow them to bring water to the site and to use power generators. Locals in Hardhorn, Lancashire (pictured above) accused the camp's (pictured nearby) occupants of trashing their leafy village . But in 2010, a county court judge then told the authorities to 'use their best endeavours' to help the travellers get a post code for the land from the Post Office. At the time, the travellers argued they needed a postcode to help fire and ambulance crews find them if they were in need of an emergency - and the ruling meant they could also apply for state benefits, plus utilities including gas electricity and water. The group then applied for planning permission to stay on the fields for good and proposed to install further utility buildings, cesspools, fencing and hardstandings. Fylde Council refused the group retrospective planning permission and issued an enforcement notice instead demanding that they move off the site. An inspector at a planning inquiry also ruled that they had to leave. But a travellers group representative Elizabeth Collins then appealed and took the matter to the High Court in September 2012. There, another judge ruled the planning inspector's decision should stand. He also ordered Miss Collins to pay \u00a38,000 in costs. The group were initially given until July last year to quit - but just days before the council's deadline for the travellers to move, Miss Collins lodged an appeal which further delayed the eviction. Arguing the enforcement notices were 'unlawful', she said the eviction would force her and her extended family on to the roadside, which will have a major impact on the children living on the site. She added that the children's human rights were 'violated' as eviction would affect their health and educational prospects.", "reference": "Irish travellers have refused to budge from site in\u00a0Hardhorn, Lancashire .\nLast October, the group were told to move out by the Court of Appeal .\nThey took case to Supreme Court arguing eviction 'violated' human rights of 39 children living on the site .\nLocals say they have suffered due to 'neighbours from hell' for five years ."}, "481": {"id": "eaca088714c0b7aecc7cfc1706169dfe439ccb39", "article": "England international Ben Morgan has delivered an encouraging fitness bulletin as he continues to recover from a season-ending injury and retain the hope of keeping alive his World Cup dream. The Gloucester No 8 has not played since breaking his left leg during an Aviva Premiership game against Saracens in early January. But the signs suggest he is on course to play a part during England's World Cup warm-up period ahead of the tournament kicking off in mid-September. Ben Morgan is hopeful of featuring for England at the forthcoming World Cup despite his long-term injury . Morgan last featured for England when he scored two tries during their victory over Australia five months ago. Injury then struck, and he missed the entire RBS 6 Nations campaign as a result. The 26-year-old, though, remains an integral part of England boss Stuart Lancaster's World Cup plans, and the current prognosis is a good one after Morgan recently underwent final surgery to remove a pin from his leg. 'To be honest, I have not found this difficult at all,' said 27 times-capped Morgan, after watching his Gloucester colleagues continue their preparations for Friday night's European Challenge Cup final against Edinburgh. 'I am really positive and using this as a great experience to make myself better for when I come back. Who else gets six months off to rest up and train hard? 'Yes, I will be at a disadvantage in terms of the fact I haven't played any rugby. 'But looking at the World Cup in particular, there will be lads who wouldn't have played for probably two and a bit months going into the first (warm-up) game, so everyone is going to be on an equal playing field. 'Things are going well at the moment. I am just trying to make sure I get back healthy when I come back. Gloucester No 8 Morgan broke his left leg playing against Saracens in the Aviva Premiership in January . 'I have a lot of strengthening to do around my legs - in the early stages you don't want to rush that. When things strengthen up, that's when I can start chucking some serious tin around. 'I had an operation last week. It is a case of seeing if things affect my ankle, and if they don't, then I can do them again. 'It is very reactive. I just have to take it day by day. It could be a couple of weeks down the line or a couple of months down the line when I run again, but there is no point rushing this sort of thing.' Lancaster is due to name a 45-man World Cup training squad next month, followed by his final 31-man group for the tournament in late August. England's World Cup preparations, meanwhile, also feature home and away games against France in August, plus a September appointment with reigning Six Nations champions Ireland at Twickenham. Morgan last played for England during his side's victory against the Wallabies at Twickenham in November . Reflecting on the injury, Morgan added: 'It was tough, but it was one of those things. It happens - deal with it. 'If I start thinking about what I missed out on, I'm just going to become negative. I have this mindset going forward about living the law of attraction. 'It is basically positivity breeds positivity. If you get that positive mindset, you attract everything into your life that is positive. I'm thinking of this as a positive experience. 'I can get bigger, better, faster, stronger and improve myself as a player before I come back. I can use this to my advantage. Otherwise I could sit there and fester and get fat, lazy and never come back. 'I sat in the hospital and thought to myself 'okay, it's done. How long is it going to take me to get back?'' 'Ideally, I would like to be back playing in those warm-up games because that gives me a shot of getting in the squad. 'There are so many variables about what can happen, though. 'I might get a couple of months down the line and think that realistically I'm not going to get back, so think about next season instead. I have to look after myself. 'Yes, I desperately want to get back and put myself in contention, but I'm not going to do anything that is detrimental to my health.

Arsene Wenger confirmed Szczesny will play ahead of David Ospina against Reading at Wembley on Saturday but offered no further guarantees. \u2018At the moment, I hope yes,\u2019 said Wenger, after a long, uncharacteristic hesitation, when asked if Szczesny had a long-term future at the club. \u2018It is very difficult to answer that question, you know. What is important is Saturday. Wojciech Szczesny will start in goal for Arsenal for the their FA Cup clash with Reading at Wembley . \u2018His attitude is very good. He has trained very well, very focused. Your job is to fight for your place, no matter how difficult it is. When you choose this kind of job you know it is down to competition.\u2019 Szczesny is understood to be content with his situation and confident of winning back his place. His Arsenal contract runs until 2018, but he has made just three appearances \u2014 all in the FA Cup \u2014 since an error-strewn display at Southampton on New Year\u2019s Day. Arsenal have greatly improved since the defeat at St Mary\u2019s when Szczesny mix-ups led to two goals. He then infuriated Wenger after the game by puffing on a cigarette in the showers. The Polish international has lost his place to David Ospina after a number of errors this season . Former Arsenal midfielder John Jensen went on Danish television before the smoking revelations and claimed Szczesny had been fined and would not play for Wenger again. The spin machine at the Emirates set about rubbishing this theory and Jensen\u2019s sources, but so far Jensen has been vindicated. Ospina came in for the next game against Hull in the FA Cup third round and stayed in goal when Arsenal played Stoke in the Premier League a week later. The Colombian then kept his place. \u2018They know the rules,\u2019 said Wenger. \u2018They are set at the start of the season. I replaced Wojciech because he had a bad game. I still think he\u2019s a great goalkeeper and want him to have the opportunity to show that. The Colombian has taken his chance with both hands, winning 11 out the 12 games he's started in goal . \u2018It is important two goalkeepers get competition and he will get that in the FA Cup now as long as Ospina plays in the Premier League. Barcelona play their No 2 goalkeeper in the Champions League. Why? Because you need to give them competition.\u2019 Ospina has won 11 of 12 Premier League games since the Szczesny chop, but he could not prevent a 3-1 defeat in the first leg of the Champions League tie against Monaco.His unfussy style has solidified a notoriously brittle team. With frailties due to their commitment to attractive football, Arsenal crave reliability from their goalkeeper. Szczesny, for all his bravado and talent, was anything but reliable, with a short attention span and a tendency to become bored and seek involvement even when (especially when) his team were in control. Arsene Wenger admits that Szczesny lost his place to his errors but insists he's working hard in training . Ospina is a soothing influence and Wenger\u2019s belated decision to grasp the nettle has strengthened the team, together with the unexpected advances of Francis Coquelin and Hector Bellerin. Coquelin has added ball-winning bite to midfield and Bellerin, with his exceptional pace, is not in such a hurry as others to abandon his post at right back and rampage forward. Add to this a philosophical tweak \u2014 a will to defend harder and adjust to different opponents, such as the attempt to combat Burnley\u2019s high-intensity pressing game by encouraging Ospina to kick almost every ball, and Arsenal are sturdier. Monaco was an aberration caused by complacency or, more likely, an indicator that there is more to do. Wenger will be aware of this and was reluctant to smother Ospina with the credit for a run of 16 wins in 18 games since Southampton. \u2018It\u2019s a mixture of things,\u2019 said Wenger. \u2018We had many players back. Laurent Koscielny, Mesut Ozil and Olivier Giroud came back but they came back into form as well in January. And Coquelin is doing well.\u2019 Francis Coquelin (centre) has been one of the success stories of the season and is a key player for Arsenal . It was not overwhelming backing for his No 1 and supports the idea that Wenger will prioritise signing another keeper in the summer when Chelsea\u2019s Petr Cech will be on the market. Like Ospina, Cech is a calming presence and a mature personality. Cech also has experience of winning major trophies. In short, he is precisely the sort of individual Arsenal have lacked in recent years. To invest in Cech would be to lose Ospina. The Colombian was happy to sign as No 2 and challenge Szczesny but that is a different psychological proposition to losing your No 1 status to a big-money signing, despite having performed so well. It is a delicate issue for Wenger, a manager often accused of being too loyal. For Szczesny, there appears no way back. Like Lukasz Fabianski last year, it promises to be the FA Cup and out and proof that Jensen was right all along. A move for Petr Cech has been spoken about but it remains to be seen of Wenger will bring in another keeper .", "reference": "Wojciech Szczesny to play in goal during Arsenal's FA Cup semi-final .\nThe Poland international lost the No 1 spot to new signing David Ospina .\nSzczesny could leave the club if another keeper is bought by Wenger .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Arsenal news ."}, "483": {"id": "eaa1e943563f924fae1ee639ce4d88529a8ae04f", "article": "A Labour candidate has denied launching a foul-mouthed attack on a political rival for pointing out he lives in a \u00a31.5 million home.

She added that she wanted the teacher to stop the marriage 'whichever way possible', the India Times\u00a0reported. It is thought the 'oath' Duli refers to is the school's promise she had to make when she started, but exactly what it included is not known.

He told the Hindustan Times\u00a0that it was difficult to find a suitable match for a grown-up girl. The Child Marriage Restraint Act, passed in India during British rule in 1929, specified that a girl must be 18 and a boy 21 before they can wed. But the country has the second highest number of child marriages, according to a UN report. Nearly 52 per cent of girls are married before reaching 18 years old, Indian records show.

This is despite the Child Marriage Restraint Act, passed  during British rule in 1929, specifying that a girl must be 18 and a boy 21 before they can wed.

The number of child brides is estimated to rise to 140 million by 2020 if current trends continue, 18.5 million of which will be under 15 years old, analysts warn. Statistics show that girls living in poor households are almost twice as likely to marry before 18 than girls in higher income households.

The pariah state may also have the capability to produce enough weapons-grade uranium to double its arsenal by next year, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Chinese estimates of Pyongyang's nuclear production, relayed to US nuclear specialists, exceed most previous US forecasts of between 10 to 16 bombs, said the report, which cited people briefed on the matter.

The pariah state may have as many as 20 nuclear warheads, it has now been suggested . North Korean leader Kim Jong Un addresses Korean People's Army pilots in an undated photo released by the state news agency earlier this month.\u00a0Under the Kim dynasty North Korea has long used nuclear weapons as a bargaining chip in international relations . Experts at the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies earlier this year presented three scenarios for North Korea's nuclear capability, predicting its stockpile of weapons could grow to 50 or even 100 within five years. North Korea has conducted three nuclear detonations, the most recent in February 2013. Asked about the report at a regular press briefing yesterday, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said he 'did not have knowledge of the specific situation'. 'We must persevere with denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula, persevere in safeguarding peace and stability, and persevere in resolving the relevant issue through dialogue,' Hong said. Earlier this month, US Admiral William Gortney, commander of the US Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command, said the US military believes North Korea has the ability to miniaturise a warhead and mount it on a ballistic missile, although there had been no tests. One such rocket is an intercontinental missile with could theoretically hit California as it is designed to carry a payload of more than 5,000 miles. Kim Jong Un (centre in black) posing with his soldiers on top of snow-covered Mount Paektu in North Korea. The country could have as many as 100 warheads within five years, it has been suggested . Stanford University professor Sigfried Hecker was allowed to visit Pyongyang in 2010 and reported seeing a large uranium-enrichment facility. The Journal quoted him as saying: 'Some eight, nine, or 10 years ago, they had the bomb but not much of a nuclear arsenal. 'I had hoped they wouldn't go in this direction, but that's what happened in the past five years. 'The more they believe they have a fully functional nuclear arsenal and deterrent, the more difficult it's going to be to walk them back from that.' North Korea carried out nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013, and has an extremely active ballistic missile development programme, although expert opinion is split on how much progress it has made, reports Agence France Presse. The Chinese estimate reflects growing concern in Beijing about the nuclear ambitions of its errant ally, and is the latest in a series of expert assessments that suggest Pyongyang is moving faster down the nuclear path than previously thought. Kim Jong Un inspecting the newly built Wonsan Baby Home and Orphanage in a photo released earlier this month. North Korea has conducted three nuclear detonations, the most recent in February 2013 . In 2012, Pyongyang demonstrated its rocket capabilities by sending a satellite into orbit, but it has yet to conduct a test that would show it had mastered the re-entry technology required for an inter-continental ballistic missile. The other key question is how close the North is to being able to miniaturise a nuclear device that could be fitted on the tip of a missile. In a white paper published in January, the South Korean defence ministry said the North had already taken its miniaturisation technology to a 'significant' level. Under the Kim dynasty, represented by current leader Kim Jong Un, North Korea has long used nuclear weapons as a bargaining chip in international relations. Last month the country's ambassador to the UK issued a chilling warning that North Korea would be prepared to use nuclear weapons.

As the London Mayor tried to hammer ill-fitting pieces together with his hands, the Prime Minister tried out what could be a new election slogan, telling him: 'If in doubt, wedge it in.' After being put right by a four-year-old who spotted their errors, the pair had more fun finger painting with Tory blue paint.

When they tried to put the puzzle back together, they hit trouble after it proved to be more difficult than expected . The Conservative duo made their first appearance together on the campaign trail with a visit to Advantage day nursery in Surbiton, south west London. They were supposed to be highlighting Tory plans to double free childcare for 600,000 children aged three and four. They sat at a table with Joshua and Stephanie, both aged three, and four-year-olds Hamish and Leo where they broke up a puzzle which depicted the four seasons. When they tried to put it back together, they hit trouble after it proved to be more difficult than expected. After taking nine minutes to complete the puzzle, the Tory duo were relieved to try their hand at hand painting, which they found much easier . The pair were at the nursery in Surbiton to promote a Tory pledge to double free childcare for working parents of three and four-year-olds to 30 hours a week . Arriving at the nursery, Mr Cameron appeared to be giving Mr Johnson a ticking off before the visit had even started . Like a bad workman blaming his tools, Mr Johnson soon started to question whether there was a fundamental design fault. 'January is in winter,' he complained. 'There's something wrong with the puzzle.' The clock ticked on and Tory aides grew nervous, as Mr Cameron insisted: We've got all day.' Mr Johnson, fearing defeat, was adamant: 'We can't be beaten by the puzzle.' With the media crowding into classroom, Hamish asked Mr Cameron why there were so many journalists.\u00a0'If we finish the puzzle it will make them go away,' the PM said. But the children had spotted more errors. 'I've found another problem,' said Leo. Mr Johnson, already known as a political heavyweight, then tried brute force to get the pieces to fit by hammering them with his fist.

There will be no feelings of envy as he applauds Hearts on to the Ibrox pitch. Despite enduring much injury-induced frustration in his three seasons in Govan, the winger remains adamant he can prove his worth by rekindling the kind of form he once showed in maroon. Templeton made his first start in almost three months last weekend as Stuart McCall's recorded a 4-1 victory over Cowdenbeath. That followed up a breakthrough win over Hibernian at Easter Road and enhanced confidence ahead of a real litmus test of their recent progress. Rangers ace David Templeton promotes tickets for Sunday's match against Hearts at Ibrox . Hearts romped to the title with seven games to spare and currently sit 26 points in front of a Rangers side fighting to finish as best of the rest ahead of the play-offs. This wasn't a scenario Templeton could ever have envisaged when he moved west along the M8 in August 2012, away from Vladimir Romanov's teetering reign that would eventually lapse into administration. Back then, Rangers were just starting to emerge from their own, even deeper, financial meltdown of liquidation. Few predicted any on-field problems in their journey back up the leagues. Rangers' Haris Vuckic & Nicky Clark training at Murray Park ahead of the clash with Hearts . This season has told a very different story. Templeton, though, insists he has had no regretful thoughts of what it would be like to somehow still be a Hearts player. 'No, because I think I would have been away the following season anyway,' he said. 'At the time I moved, it was the right time for me, I was kind of forced out, as well. 'It was just one of those things, it was a good move at the time and if we can go up through the play-offs then I still think it would have been a good move. Rangers' Tom Walsh training at Murray Park ahead of their clash with runaway leaders Hearts . 'It's massive that we do that. When I signed for Rangers with the squad we had, I thought we would go up each year. For us as a club - and the supporters and everyone - it's massive to get back to the top league. 'My time here has been pretty frustrating, personally. The first season I really enjoyed, although I picked up a couple of injuries which didn't help. 'Last season, I had a couple of little niggles pre-season and then I didn't play a lot. This season, the exact same. Hopefully now I can keep myself fit and start afresh if we go up.' Rangers captain Lee McCulloch holds the ball up as his teammates look on during a training session . Templeton is not among the dozen or so first-team players out of contract this summer, with 12 months still left on his deal. 'The fans have definitely not seen the best of me,' he admitted. 'I need to get back playing the way I was before I signed here because that was the reason I signed for Rangers. 'I know that I'm good enough to get back to that and hopefully the manager sees that in me.' Rangers trialists Milos Milovic (left) and Josef Shirdel (right) are put through their paces during training . Templeton on Friday lauded the difference McCall has made since his arrival last month. The 26-year-old claimed he now felt more confident about expressing himself on the field. 'Earlier in the season, I played a few games and didn't do too well, but at the same time the team wasn't doing as well either and it's hard to stand out then,' he said. 'Last Saturday we were really attacking and creating a load of chances which made me feel a lot better, a lot more confident. The manager has given me the confidence as well since he has come in. Rangers' Lee Wallace tests his reaction speeds as he is put through his paces during training . 'Even before I'm going on in games, he'll just tell me to stay wide, get the ball and attack. It doesn't matter how many times I lose it in the final third, but just to try and make things happen. As a winger, that's what you like to hear - that you're not going to be criticised for trying to do the right things.' Hearts have won both previous matches against Rangers this term but Templeton believes the gap in those games was not significant. 'The past few times we have played Hearts we didn't actually do too badly,' he added. 'In the first game of the season we should have won it - I missed a sitter at 0-0 and if I had scored it we would have gone on to win the game. Templeton holds the ball up as a Rangers teammate looks to dispossess him during a training session . 'The second game, we started well and they couldn't get out of their half. But then we had a man sent off which didn't help us. 'It will be good to play against them on Sunday. They have been excellent this season and thoroughly deserved to win the title. But we will work on how we will play and I am sure we will all be ready.' McCall is dismissive of any suggestion that Hearts might somehow slacken off having already secured a Premiership return. Hearts' Jordan McGhee (right) speaks with teammate Callum Paterson at training ahead of their game . 'If you have won nine on the bounce and you are champions then you are going to have a lot of confidence,' insisted the Ibrox boss. 'Every one of their players will have that. They also have a real good spirit. 'It is a test for us but every game between now and the end of the season will bring a test. Going down to Queen of the South on Thursday will be tough. 'But I take the point that people will look at the Hearts game and think it might be a barometer of how far we have come. The Hearts squad train at Tynecastle ahead of their fixture with Rangers on Sunday . 'We have improved each game and that is all we are asking for again. But we will slip up between now and the end of the season, no doubt. We won't win every game. 'There will be ups and downs but it is about how we handle it. There is a little bit of belief back in the players again, but we know it is only two wins.

Now a trickle of royal fans, some familiar faces among them, have begun arriving at the Lindo Wing ahead of the royal birth. But the  group, which includes well-known royal enthusiast Margaret Tyler, 71, could be in for a long wait as the Duchess of Cambridge's due date is more than a week away. Getting ready: Royal superfans Margaret Tyler and John Loughery outside the Lindo Wing . That, however, wasn't enough to dampen spirits with the group, all of whom had come prepared with Union flags, posing happily for the gathering Press pack. Joining Mrs Tyler was another familiar face - that of self-confessed royal 'superfan' John Loughery, 60, who camped out overnight ahead of the 2011 Royal Wedding and was the only member of the public to attend every day of the inquest into the death of Princess Diana in 2008. Mr Loughery, a former chef, said at the time he hoped to go down in history for the feat and told the BBC that he wouldn't be surprised 'if a portrait of me is hanging inside Kensington Palace in 100 years from now'. Equally serious about the Royal Family is Mrs Tyler, an avid collector of royal memorabilia who has amassed a trove worth more than \u00a310,000.

Diana fan: His favourite was Princess Diana and he attended every day of the 2008 inquest into her death . Mrs Tyler, who gave birth to her son Andrew at the Lindo Wing, says she considers the royals to be part of her family and has been following their exploits for more than 40 years. Her collection of royal souvenirs, which includes a \u00a31,200 bust of Prince Charles, is so vast, it takes up four rooms in her small terraced home in London. Like Mr Loughery, Mrs Tyler was also at the Lindo Wing for the birth of Prince George and ended up spending six days waiting for him to arrive. 'I was there for six days,' she told a recent episode of BBC2 show Collectaholics. '[My son] Andrew was born at St. Mary's and I was only there for two days. 'I just wanted to feel close to them [William and Kate], I suppose. I spent the time meeting people, and chatting.I was convinced it was going to be a girl, but it wasn't.'

Nevertheless, preparations for the birth are well past the planning stages, with a media pen designed to hold the expected influx from around the world opening today. The police have also begun patrolling outside the Lindo Wing and have barred photographers from getting too close to the door.

Mike Pence, state health officials said on Friday. There are now 120 confirmed HIV cases and 10 preliminary positive cases tied to Scott County, about 30 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky. That's up from 106 last week, said the Indiana State Department of Health. Health officials who declared an epidemic last month have said they expect the number of cases to rise as more people are tested. But the growing number could put pressure on Pence to extend the 30-day needle exchange program that he approved on March 26. Scroll down for video . More than two weeks into a short-term needle exchange program approved by Gov. Mike Pence, there are now 120 confirmed HIV cases and 10 preliminary positive cases tied to Scott County, about 30 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky . Spokeswoman Kara Brooks said Pence is reviewing reports and recommendations from health officials and will make a decision early next week about extending the program beyond April 25. The Scott County outbreak has occurred among intravenous drug users and primarily involves the use of the high-powered painkiller Opana, health officials have said. The county typically sees about five HIV cases each year. Since Pence approved the temporary needle exchange, 5,322 clean syringes have been provided to 86 participants, health officials said Friday. About 1,400 used syringes have been returned. Brittany Combs, public health nurse for the Scott County Health Department, said the needle-exchange program had 'really picked up a lot this week,' in large part because a mobile unit has been traveling around neighborhoods seeking to get more IV drug users into the program. 'It's that trust factor. You have to gain that trust, and I think we're slowly starting to do that,' Combs said. But the future of the Scott County program, as well as the fate of legislation that would allow needle-exchange programs in other counties, isn't clear. The Scott County outbreak has occurred among intravenous drug users and primarily involves the use of the high-powered prescription painkiller Opana, health officials have said . Pence opposes needle exchanges as an anti-drug policy. Senate President Pro Tem David Long said on Thursday that the emergency exchange for Scott County was 'the right reaction' but wasn't sure if it is the correct approach long-term. Nor was he sure whether the Senate would support legislation sponsored by House Public Health Committee Chairman Ed Clere, R-New Albany, that would allow the 23 Indiana counties with the highest rate-per-population of hepatitis C to establish their own needle-exchange programs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that between 50 percent and 90 percent of people with hepatitis C are also infected with HIV. Health officials say because of this, high rates of hepatitis C are a key indicator of needle-sharing and a potential HIV outbreak. The House approved the bill on April 7 in a 54-39 vote, and the measure is scheduled for a hearing on Monday in a House-Senate conference committee, which will try to work out a final version for lawmakers to consider before the Legislature's April 29 adjournment deadline. Long said Pence isn't alone in his concerns that needle exchanges could promote drug use instead of prevent it. 'At the same time, you adapt and you evolve based on the world we live in, so we're going to have to see if that requires a pivot for us,' Long said. Medical waste containers stored in preparation for Scott County residents that are looking to exchange used needles. The needle-exchange program was created through an emergency executive order signed last week by Gov. Mike Pence in an attempt to curb the state's largest-ever HIV outbreak . Clere said he appreciates Pence's approval of the short-term needle exchange but that 'it doesn't help in other areas of the state that are at risk for a similar outbreak. It's just not enough.' He said the association between needle exchanges and illegal drug activity makes many people, including lawmakers, uncomfortable. But he thinks the exchange program shouldn't be viewed as anti-drug policy, but as 'a proven and effective harm-reduction policy.' 'We simply can't afford to view this as a short-term problem,' Clere said. Money could also be an issue as lawmakers weigh their options. Since 1989, the federal government has banned public funding of needle exchange programs. Pence's executive order didn't include money for the Scott County program. 'They asked the state agencies to find their own money. How sustainable is that?' said Dr. Beth Meyerson, co-director of the Rural Center for AIDS/STD Prevention at Indiana University. 'There's no evidence that the Pence administration is thinking about this in the long term at all.'", "reference": "There are now 120 confirmed HIV cases and 10 preliminary positive cases tied to Scott County, about 30 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky .\nOutbreak has occurred among intravenous drug users and primarily involves the use of the high-powered prescription painkiller Opana .\nHealth officials who declared an epidemic last month have said they expect the number of cases to rise as more people are tested .\nGov.
